2022-001,36,"This case concerns a nagging question about the outer reaches of the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal law regulating water pollution in the United States.1 By all accounts, the Act has been a great success. Before its enactment in 1972, many of the Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams were severely polluted, and existing federal legislation had proved to be inadequate. Today, many formerly fetid bodies of water are safe for the use and enjoyment of the people of this country.",Alito,0,
2022-001,37,"There is, however, an unfortunate footnote to this success story: the outer boundaries of the Act's geographical reach have been uncertain from the start. The Act applies to the waters of the United States, but what does that phrase mean? Does the term encompass any backyard that is soggy enough for some minimum period of time? Does it reach mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, or playa lakes?2 How about ditches, swimming pools, and puddles?",Alito,0,
2022-001,38,"For more than a half century, the agencies responsible for enforcing the Act have wrestled with the problem and adopted varying interpretations. On three prior occasions, this Court has tried to clarify the meaning of the waters of the United States. But the problem persists. When we last addressed the question 17 years ago, we were unable to agree on an opinion of the Court.3 Today, we return to the problem and attempt to identify with greater clarity what the Act means by the waters of the United States.",Alito,0,
2022-001,41,"For most of this Nation's history, the regulation of water pollution was left almost entirely to the States and their subdivisions. The common law permitted aggrieved parties to bring nuisance suits against polluters. But as industrial production and population growth increased the quantity and toxicity of pollution, States gradually shifted to enforcement by regulatory agencies.4 Conversely, federal regulation was largely limited to ensuring that traditional navigable waters—that is, interstate waters that were either navigable in fact and used in commerce or readily susceptible of being used in this way— remained free of impediments. See, e.g., Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 30 Stat. 1151, see also United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S. 377, 406-407, 61 S.Ct. 291, 85 L.Ed. 243 (1940), The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563, 19 L.Ed. 999 (1871).",Alito,0,
2022-001,42,"Congress's early efforts at directly regulating water pollution were tepid. Although the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 allowed federal officials to seek judicial abatement of pollution in interstate waters, it imposed high hurdles, such as requiring the consent of the State where the pollution originated. See 62 Stat. 1156-1157. Despite repeated amendments over the next two decades, few actions were brought under this framework.5",Alito,0,
2022-001,43,"Congress eventually replaced this scheme in 1972 with the CWA. See 86 Stat. 816. The Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into navigable waters. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1362(12)(A). It broadly defines the term `pollutant' to include not only contaminants like chemical wastes, but also more mundane materials like rock, sand, and cellar dirt. § 1362(6).",Alito,0,
2022-001,44,"The CWA is a potent weapon. It imposes what have been described as crushing consequences even for inadvertent violations. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 602, 136 S.Ct. 1807, 195 L.Ed.2d 77 (2016) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Property owners who negligently discharge pollutants into covered waters may face severe criminal penalties including imprisonment. § 1319(c). These penalties increase for knowing violations. Ibid. On the civil side, the CWA imposes over $60,000 in fines per day for each violation. See Note following 28 U.S.C. § 2461, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(d), 88 Fed. Reg. 989 (2023) (to be codified in 40 C.F.R. § 19.4). And due to the Act's 5-year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. § 2462, and expansive interpretations of the term violation, these civil penalties can be nearly as crushing as their criminal counterparts, see, e.g., Borden Ranch Partnership v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 261 F.3d 810, 813, 818 (C.A.9 2001) (upholding Agency decision to count each of 348 passes of a plow by a farmer through jurisdictional soil on his farm as a separate violation), aff'd by an equally divided Court, 537 U.S. 99, 123 S.Ct. 599, 154 L.Ed.2d 508 (2002) (per curiam).",Alito,0,
2022-001,45,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly enforce the CWA. The EPA is tasked with policing violations after the fact, either by issuing orders demanding  compliance or by bringing civil actions. § 1319(a). The Act also authorizes private plaintiffs to sue to enforce its requirements. § 1365(a). On the front end, both agencies are empowered to issue permits exempting activity that would otherwise be unlawful under the Act. Relevant here, the Corps controls permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into covered waters. See § 1344(a). The costs of obtaining such a permit are significant, and both agencies have admitted that the permitting process can be arduous, expensive, and long. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S., at 594-595, 601, 136 S.Ct. 1807. Success is also far from guaranteed, as the Corps has asserted discretion to grant or deny permits based on a long, nonexclusive list of factors that ends with a catchall mandate to consider in general, the needs and welfare of the people. 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1) (2022).",Alito,0,
2022-001,46,"Due to the CWA's capacious definition of pollutant, its low mens rea, and its severe penalties, regulated parties have focused particular attention on the Act's geographic scope. While its predecessor encompassed interstate or navigable waters, 33 U.S.C. § 1160(a) (1970 ed.), the CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into only navigable waters, which it defines as the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1362(7), (12)(A) (2018 ed.). The meaning of this definition is the persistent problem that we must address.",Alito,0,
2022-001,48,"Michael and Chantell Sackett have spent well over a decade navigating the CWA, and their voyage has been bumpy and costly. In 2004, they purchased a small lot near Priest Lake, in Bonner County, Idaho. In preparation for building a modest home, they began backfilling their property with dirt and rocks. A few months later, the EPA sent the Sacketts a compliance order informing them that their backfilling violated the CWA because their property contained protected wetlands. The EPA demanded that the Sacketts immediately `undertake activities to restore the Site' pursuant to a `Restoration Work Plan' that it provided. Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 125, 132 S.Ct. 1367, 182 L.Ed.2d 367 (2012). The order threatened the Sacketts with penalties of over $40,000 per day if they did not comply.",Alito,0,
2022-001,49,"At the time, the EPA interpreted the waters of the United States to include all  waters that could affect interstate or foreign commerce, as well as wetlands adjacent to those waters. 40 C.F.R. §§ 230.3(s)(3), (7) (2008). Adjacent was defined to mean not just bordering or contiguous, but also neighboring. § 230.3(b). Agency guidance instructed officials to assert jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to non-navigable tributaries when those wetlands had a significant nexus to a traditional navigable water.6 A significant nexus was said to exist when `wetlands, either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity' of those waters. 2007 Guidance 8 (emphasis added). In looking for evidence of a significant nexus, field agents were told to consider a wide range of openended hydrological and ecological factors. See id., at 7.",Alito,0,
2022-001,50,"According to the EPA, the wetlands on the Sacketts' lot are adjacent to (in the sense that they are in the same neighborhood as) what it described as an unnamed tributary on the other side of a 30-foot  road. App. 33. That tributary feeds into a non-navigable creek, which, in turn, feeds into Priest Lake, an intrastate body of water that the EPA designated as traditionally navigable. To establish a significant nexus, the EPA lumped the Sacketts' lot together with the Kalispell Bay Fen, a large nearby wetland complex that the Agency regarded as similarly situated. According to the EPA, these properties, taken together, significantly affect the ecology of Priest Lake. Therefore, the EPA concluded, the Sacketts had illegally dumped soil and gravel onto the waters of the United States.",Alito,0,
2022-001,51,"The Sacketts filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702 et seq., alleging that the EPA lacked jurisdiction because any wetlands on their property were not waters of the United States. The District Court initially dismissed the suit, reasoning that the compliance order was not a final agency action, but this Court ultimately held that the Sacketts could bring their suit under the APA. See Sackett, 566 U.S., at 131, 132 S.Ct. 1367. After seven years of additional proceedings on remand, the District Court entered summary judgment for the EPA. 2019 WL 13026870 (D. Idaho, Mar. 31, 2019). The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the CWA covers adjacent wetlands with a significant nexus to traditional navigable waters and that the Sacketts' lot satisfied that standard. 8 F.4th 1075, 1091-1093 (2021).",Alito,0,
2022-001,52,"We granted certiorari to decide the proper test for determining whether wetlands are waters of the United States. 595 U.S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 896, 211 L.Ed.2d 604 (2022).",Alito,0,
2022-001,55,"In defining the meaning of the waters of the United States, we revisit what has been a contentious and difficult task. National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 U.S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 617, 624, 199 L.Ed.2d 501 (2018). The phrase has sparked decades of agency action and litigation. In order to resolve the CWA's applicability to wetlands, we begin by reviewing this history.",Alito,0,
2022-001,56,"The EPA and the Corps initially promulgated different interpretations of the waters of the United States. The EPA defined its jurisdiction broadly to include, for example, intrastate lakes used by interstate travelers. 38 Fed. Reg. 13529 (1973). Conversely, the Corps, consistent with its historical authority to regulate obstructions to navigation, asserted jurisdiction over only traditional navigable waters. 39 Fed. Reg. 12119 (1974). But the Corps' narrow definition did not last. It soon promulgated new, much broader definitions designed to reach the outer limits of Congress's commerce power. See 42 Fed. Reg. 37144, and n. 2 (1977), 40 Fed. Reg. 31324-31325 (1975).",Alito,0,
2022-001,57,"Eventually the EPA and Corps settled on materially identical definitions. See 45 Fed. Reg. 33424 (1980), 47 Fed. Reg. 31810-31811 (1982). These broad definitions encompassed all  waters that could affect interstate or foreign commerce. 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(s)(3) (2008). So long as the potential for an interstate effect was present, the regulation extended the CWA to, for example, intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds. Ibid. The agencies likewise took an expansive view of the CWA's coverage of wetlands adjacent to covered waters. § 230.3(s)(7). As noted, they defined adjacent to mean bordering, contiguous, or neighboring and clarified that adjacent wetlands include  those that are separated from covered waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes and the like. § 230.3(b). They also specified that wetlands is a technical term encompassing those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. § 230.3(t). The Corps released what would become a 143-page manual to guide officers when they determine whether property meets this definition.7",Alito,0,
2022-001,58,"This Court first construed the meaning of the waters of the United States in United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 106 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). There, we were confronted with the Corps' assertion of authority under the CWA over wetlands that actually abutted on a navigable waterway. Id., at 135, 106 S.Ct. 455. Although we expressed concern that wetlands seemed to fall outside traditional notions of `waters,' we nonetheless deferred to the Corps, reasoning that the transition from water to solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one. Id., at 132-133, 106 S.Ct. 455.",Alito,0,
2022-001,59,"The agencies responded to Riverside Bayview by expanding their interpretations even further. Most notably, they issued the migratory bird rule, which extended jurisdiction to any waters or wetlands that are or would be used as a habitat by migratory birds or endangered species. See 53 Fed. Reg. 20765 (1988), 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986). As the Corps would later admit, nearly all waters were jurisdictional under the migratory bird rule.8",Alito,0,
2022-001,60,"In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 121 S.Ct. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001) (SWANCC), this Court rejected the migratory bird rule, which the Corps had used to assert jurisdiction over several isolated ponds located wholly within the State of Illinois. Disagreeing with the Corps' argument that ecological interests supported its jurisdiction, we instead held that the CWA does not extend to ponds that are not adjacent to open water. Id., at 168, 121 S.Ct. 675 (emphasis deleted).",Alito,0,
2022-001,61,"Days after our decision, the agencies issued guidance that sought to minimize SWANCC's impact. They took the view that this Court's holding was strictly limited to waters that are `nonnavigable, isolated, and intrastate' and that field staff should continue to exercise CWA jurisdiction to the full extent of their authority for any waters that fall outside of that category.9 The agencies never defined exactly what they regarded as the full extent of their authority. They instead encouraged local field agents to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.",Alito,0,
2022-001,62,"What emerged was a system of vague rules that depended on locally developed practices. GAO Report 26. Deferring to the agencies' localized decisions, lower courts blessed an array of expansive interpretations of the CWA's reach. See, e.g.,  United States v. Deaton, 332 F.3d 698, 702 (C.A.4 2003) (holding that a property owner violated the CWA by piling soil near a ditch 32 miles from navigable waters). Within a few years, the agencies had interpreted their jurisdiction over `the waters of the United States' to cover 270-to-300 million acres of wetlands and virtually any parcel of land containing a channel or conduit  through which rainwater or drainage may occasionally or intermittently flow. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S. 715, 722, 126 S.Ct. 2208, 165 L.Ed.2d 159 (2006) (plurality opinion).",Alito,0,
2022-001,63,"It was against this backdrop that we granted review in Rapanos v. United States. The lower court in the principal case before us had held that the CWA covered wetlands near ditches and drains that eventually emptied into navigable waters at least 11 miles away, a theory that had supported the petitioner's conviction in a related prosecution. Id., at 720, 729, 126 S.Ct. 2208. Although we vacated that decision, no position commanded a majority of the Court. Four Justices concluded that the CWA's coverage did not extend beyond two categories: first, certain relatively permanent bodies of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and, second, wetlands with such a close physical connection to those waters that they were as a practical matter indistinguishable from waters of the United States. Id., at 742, 755, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (emphasis deleted). Four Justices would have deferred to the Government's determination that the wetlands at issue were covered under the CWA. Id., at 788, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Finally, one Justice concluded that jurisdiction under the CWA requires a significant nexus between wetlands and navigable waters and that such a nexus exists where the wetlands, either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of those waters. Id., at 779-780, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).",Alito,0,
2022-001,64,"In the decade following Rapanos, the EPA and the Corps issued guidance documents that recognized larger grey areas and called for more fact-intensive individualized determinations in those grey areas.10 As discussed, they instructed agency officials to assert jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to non-navigable tributaries based on fact-specific determinations regarding the presence of a significant nexus. 2008 Guidance 8. The guidance further advised officials to make this determination by considering a lengthy list of hydrological and ecological factors. Ibid. Echoing what they had said about the migratory bird rule, the agencies later admitted that almost all waters and wetlands across the country theoretically could be subject to a case-specific jurisdictional determination under this guidance. 80 Fed. Reg. 37056 (2015), see, e.g., Hawkes Co., 578 U.S., at 596, 136 S.Ct. 1807 (explaining that the Corps found a significant nexus between wetlands and a river some 120 miles away).",Alito,0,
2022-001,65,"More recently, the agencies have engaged in a flurry of rulemaking defining the waters of the United States. In a 2015 rule, they offered a muscular approach that would subject the vast majority of the nation's water features to a case-by-case jurisdictional analysis.11 Although  the rule listed a few examples of waters that were excluded from regulation like puddles and swimming pools, it categorically covered other waters and wetlands, including any within 1,500 feet of interstate or traditional navigable waters. 80 Fed. Reg. 37116-37117. And it subjected a wider range of other waters, including any within 4,000 feet of indirect tributaries of interstate or traditional navigable waters, to a case-specific determination for significant nexus. Ibid.",Alito,0,
2022-001,66,"The agencies repealed this sweeping rule in 2019. 84 Fed. Reg. 56626. Shortly afterwards, they replaced it with a narrower definition that limited jurisdiction to traditional navigable waters and their tributaries, lakes, and adjacent wetlands. 85 Fed. Reg. 22340 (2020). They also narrowed the definition of adjacent, limiting it to wetlands that abut covered waters, are flooded by those waters, or are separated from those waters by features like berms or barriers. Ibid. This rule too did not last. After granting the EPA's voluntary motion to remand, a District Court vacated the rule. See Pascua Yaqui Tribe v. EPA, 557 F.Supp.3d 949, 957 (D. Ariz. 2021).",Alito,0,
2022-001,67,"The agencies recently promulgated yet another rule attempting to define waters of the United States. 88 Fed. Reg. 3004 (2023) (to be codified in 40 C.F.R. § 120.2). Under that broader rule, traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, and the territorial seas, as well as their tributaries and adjacent wetlands, are waters of the United States. 88 Fed. Reg. 3143. So are any intrastate lakes and ponds, streams, or wetlands that either have a continuous surface connection to categorically included waters or have a significant nexus to interstate or traditional navigable waters. Id., at 3006, 3143. Like the post-Rapanos guidance, the rule states that a significant nexus requires consideration of a list of open-ended factors. 88 Fed. Reg. 3006, 3144. Finally, the rule returns to the broad pre-2020 definition of adjacent. Ibid., see supra, at 1332-1333. Acknowledging that field work is often necessary to confirm the presence of a wetland under these definitions, the rule instructs local agents to continue using the Corps' Wetlands Delineation Manual. 88 Fed. Reg. 3117.",Alito,0,
2022-001,69,"With the benefit of a half century of practice under the CWA, it is worth taking stock of where things stand. The agencies maintain that the significant-nexus test has been and remains sufficient to establish jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. And by the EPA's own admission, almost all waters and wetlands are potentially susceptible to regulation under that test. 80 Fed. Reg. 37056. This puts many property owners in a precarious position because it is often difficult to determine whether a particular piece of property contains waters of the United States. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S., at 594, 136 S.Ct. 1807, see 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(t) (2008). Even if a property appears dry, application of the guidance in a complicated manual ultimately decides whether it contains wetlands. See 88 Fed. Reg. 3117, Wetlands Delineation Manual 84-85 (describing not  atypical examples of wetlands that periodically lack wetlands indicators), see also Hawkes Co. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 782 F.3d 994, 1003 (C.A.8 2015) (KELLY, J., concurring) (This is a unique aspect of the CWA, most laws do not require the hiring of expert consultants to determine if they even apply to you or your property). And because the CWA can sweep broadly enough to criminalize mundane activities like moving dirt, this unchecked definition of the waters of the United States means that a staggering array of landowners are at risk of criminal prosecution or onerous civil penalties.",Alito,0,
2022-001,70,"What are landowners to do if they want to build on their property? The EPA recommends asking the Corps for a jurisdictional determination, which is a written decision on whether a particular site contains covered waters. Tr. of Oral Arg. 86, see Corps, Regulatory Guidance Letter No. 16-01, at 1 (2016) (RGL 16-01), 33 C.F.R. §§ 320.1(a)(6), 331.2. But the Corps maintains that it has no obligation to provide jurisdictional determinations, RGL 16-01, at 2, and it has already begun announcing exceptions to the legal effect of some previous determinations, see 88 Fed. Reg. 3136. Even if the Corps is willing to provide a jurisdictional determination, a property owner may find it necessary to retain an expensive expert consultant who is capable of putting together a presentation that stands a chance of persuading the Corps.12 And even then, a landowner's chances of success are low, as the EPA admits that the Corps finds jurisdiction approximately 75% of the time. Tr. of Oral Arg. 110.",Alito,0,
2022-001,71,"If the landowner is among the vast majority who receive adverse jurisdictional determinations, what then? It would be foolish to go ahead and build since the jurisdictional determination might form evidence of culpability in a prosecution or civil action. The jurisdictional determination could be challenged in court, but only after the delay and expense required to exhaust the administrative appeals process. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.7(d). And once in court, the land-owner would face an uphill battle under the deferential standards of review that the agencies enjoy. See 5 U.S.C. § 706. Another alternative would be simply to acquiesce and seek a permit from the Corps. But that process can take years and cost an exorbitant amount of money. Many landowners faced with this unappetizing menu of options would simply choose to build nothing.",Alito,0,
2022-001,73,"With this history in mind, we now consider the extent of the CWA's geographical reach.",Alito,0,
2022-001,75,"We start, as we always do, with the text of the CWA. Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U.S. 69, 74, 143 S.Ct. 665, 214 L.Ed.2d 434 (2023). As noted, the Act applies to navigable waters, which had a well-established meaning at the time of the CWA's enactment. But the CWA complicates matters by proceeding to define navigable waters as the waters of the United States, § 1362(7), which was decidedly not a well-known term of art. This frustrating drafting choice has led to decades of litigation, but we must try to make sense of the terms Congress chose to adopt. And for the reasons explained below, we conclude that the Rapanos plurality was correct: the CWA's use of waters encompasses only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water `forming geographical features' that are described in ordinary parlance as `streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.' 547 U.S., at 739, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (quoting Webster's New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954) (Webster's Second), original alterations omitted).",Alito,0,
2022-001,76,"This reading follows from the CWA's deliberate use of the plural term waters. See 547 U.S., at 732-733, 126 S.Ct. 2208.",Alito,0,
2022-001,77,"That term typically refers to bodies of water like those listed above. See, e.g., Webster's Second 2882, Black's Law Dictionary 1426 (5th ed. 1979) (especially in the plural, water may designate a body of water, such as a river, a lake, or an ocean, or an aggregate of such bodies of water, as in the phrases `foreign waters,' `waters of the United States,' and the like (emphasis added)), Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2146 (2d ed. 1987) (Random House Dictionary) (defining waters as a. flowing water, or water moving in waves: The river's mighty waters. b. the sea or seas bordering a particular country or continent or located in a particular part of the world (emphasis deleted)). This meaning is hard to reconcile with classifying `lands, wet or otherwise, as waters.' Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 740, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion) (quoting Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 132, 106 S.Ct. 455).",Alito,0,
2022-001,78,"This reading also helps to align the meaning of the waters of the United States with the term it is defining: navigable waters. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 861, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014) (In settling on a fair reading of a statute, it is not unusual to consider the ordinary meaning of a defined term, particularly when there is dissonance between that ordinary meaning and the reach of the definition). Although we have acknowledged that the CWA extends to more than traditional navigable waters, we have refused to read navigable out of the statute, holding that it at least shows that Congress was focused on its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made. SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 172, 121 S.Ct. 675, see also Appalachian Electric, 311 U.S., at 406-407, 61 S.Ct. 291, The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. at 563. At a minimum, then, the use of navigable signals that the definition principally refers to bodies of navigable water like rivers, lakes, and oceans. See Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 734, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion).",Alito,0,
2022-001,79,"More broadly, this reading accords with how Congress has employed the term waters elsewhere in the CWA and in other laws. The CWA repeatedly uses waters in contexts that confirm the term refers to bodies of open water. See 33 U.S.C. § 1267(i)(2)(D) (the waters of the Chesapeake Bay), § 1268(a)(3)(I) (the open waters of each of the Great Lakes), § 1324(d)(4)(B)(ii) (lakes and other surface waters), § 1330(g)(4)(C)(vii) (estuarine waters), § 1343(c)(1) (the waters of the territorial seas, the contiguous zone, and the oceans), §§ 1346(a)(1), 1375a(a) (coastal recreation waters), § 1370 (state boundary waters). The use of waters elsewhere in the U.S. Code likewise correlates to rivers, lakes, and oceans.13",Alito,0,
2022-001,80,"Statutory history points in the same direction. The CWA's predecessor statute covered interstate or navigable waters and defined interstate waters as all rivers, lakes, and other waters that flow across or form a part of State boundaries. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1160(a), 1173(e) (1970 ed.) (emphasis added), see also Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 30 Stat. 1151 (codified, as amended, at 33 U.S.C. § 403) (prohibiting unauthorized obstructions to the  navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States).",Alito,0,
2022-001,81,"This Court has understood the CWA's use of waters in the same way. Even as Riverside Bayview grappled with whether adjacent wetlands could fall within the CWA's coverage, it acknowledged that wetlands are not included in traditional notions of `waters.' 474 U.S., at 133, 106 S.Ct. 455. It explained that the term conventionally refers to hydrographic features like rivers and streams. Id., at 131, 106 S.Ct. 455. SWANCC went even further, repeatedly describing the waters covered by the Act as open water and suggesting that the waters of the United States principally refers to traditional navigable waters. 531 U.S., at 168-169, 172, 121 S.Ct. 675. That our CWA decisions operated under this assumption is unsurprising. Ever since Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824), this Court has used waters of the United States to refer to similar bodies of water, almost always in relation to ships. Id., at 218, 121 S.Ct. 675 (discussing a vessel's conduct in the waters of the United States).14",Alito,0,
2022-001,82,"The EPA argues that waters is naturally read to encompass wetlands because the presence of water is `universally regarded as the most basic feature of wetlands.' Brief for Respondents 19. But that reading proves too much. Consider puddles, which are also defined by the ordinary presence of water even though few would describe them as waters. This argument is also tough to square with SWANCC, which held that the Act does not cover isolated ponds, see 531 U.S., at 171, 121 S.Ct. 675, or Riverside Bayview, which would have had no need to focus so extensively on the adjacency of wetlands to covered waters if the EPA's reading were correct, see 474 U.S., at 131-135, and n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 455. Finally, it is also instructive that the CWA expressly protects the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution and to plan the development and use  of land and water resources. § 1251(b). It is hard to see how the States' role in regulating water resources would remain primary if the EPA had jurisdiction over anything defined by the presence of water. See County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, 590 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1462, 1471-1472, 206 L.Ed.2d 640 (2020), Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 737, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion).",Alito,0,
2022-001,84,"Although the ordinary meaning of waters in § 1362(7) might seem to exclude all wetlands, we do not view that provision in isolation. The meaning of a word may only become evident when placed in context, FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000), and statutory context shows that some wetlands  qualify as waters of the United States.",Alito,0,
2022-001,85,"In 1977, Congress amended the CWA and added § 1344(g)(1), which authorizes States to apply to the EPA for permission to administer programs to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into some bodies of water. In simplified terms, the provision specifies that state permitting programs may regulate discharges into (1) any waters of the United States, (2) except for traditional navigable waters, (3) including wetlands adjacent thereto.15",Alito,0,
2022-001,86,"When this convoluted formulation is parsed, it tells us that at least some wetlands must qualify as waters of the United States. The provision begins with a broad category, the waters of the United States, which we may call category A. The provision provides that States may permit discharges into these waters, but it then qualifies that States cannot permit discharges into a subcategory of A: traditional navigable waters (category B). Finally, it states that a third category (category C), consisting of wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters, is included within B. Thus, States may permit discharges into A minus B, which includes C. If C (adjacent wetlands) were not part of A (the waters of the United States) and therefore subject to regulation under the CWA, there would be no point in excluding them from that category. See Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 138, n. 11, 106 S.Ct. 455 (recognizing that § 1344(g) at least suggests strongly that the term `waters' as used in the Act does not necessarily exclude `wetlands'), Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 768, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Thus, § 1344(g)(1) presumes that certain wetlands constitute waters of the United States.",Alito,0,
2022-001,87,"But what wetlands does the CWA regulate? Section 1344(g)(1) cannot answer that question alone because it is not the operative provision that defines the Act's reach. See Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 138, n. 11, 106 S.Ct. 455. Instead, we must harmonize the reference to adjacent wetlands in § 1344(g)(1) with the waters of the United States, § 1362(7), which is the actual term we are tasked with interpreting. The formulation discussed above tells us how: because the adjacent wetlands in § 1344(g)(1) are included within the waters of the United States, these wetlands must qualify as waters of the United States in their own right. In other words, they must be indistinguishably part of a body of water that itself constitutes waters under the CWA. See supra, at 1336.",Alito,0,
2022-001,88,"This understanding is consistent with § 1344(g)(1)'s use of adjacent. Dictionaries tell us that the term adjacent may mean either contiguous or near. Random House Dictionary 25, see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 26 (1976), see also Oxford American Dictionary & Thesaurus 16 (2d ed. 2009) (listing adjoining and neighboring as synonyms  of adjacent). But construing statutory language is not merely an exercise in ascertaining `the outer limits of a word's definitional possibilities,' FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 407, 131 S.Ct. 1177, 179 L.Ed.2d 132 (2011) (alterations omitted), and here, only one  meaning produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law, United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371, 108 S.Ct. 626, 98 L.Ed.2d 740 (1988). Wetlands that are separate from traditional navigable waters cannot be considered part of those waters, even if they are located nearby.",Alito,0,
2022-001,89,"In addition, it would be odd indeed if Congress had tucked an important expansion to the reach of the CWA into convoluted language in a relatively obscure provision concerning state permitting programs. We have often remarked that Congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes by altering the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). We cannot agree with such an implausible interpretation here.",Alito,0,
2022-001,90,"If § 1344(g)(1) were read to mean that the CWA applies to wetlands that are not indistinguishably part of otherwise covered waters of the United States, see supra, at 1336, it would effectively amend and substantially broaden § 1362(7) to define navigable waters as waters of the United States and adjacent wetlands. But § 1344(g)(1)'s use of the term including makes clear that it does not purport to do—and in fact, does not do—any such thing. See National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 662-664, and n. 8, 127 S.Ct. 2518, 168 L.Ed.2d 467 (2007) (recognizing that implied amendments require `clear and manifest' evidence of congressional intent). It merely reflects Congress's assumption that certain adjacent wetlands are part of waters of the United States.",Alito,0,
2022-001,91,"This is the thrust of observations in decisions going all the way back to Riverside Bayview. In that case, we deferred to the Corps' decision to regulate wetlands actually abutting a navigable waterway, but we recognized the inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to regulable waters. 474 U.S., at 134, 106 S.Ct. 455, see also id., at 132, 106 S.Ct. 455 (noting that the transition from water to solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one due to semi-aquatic features like shallows and swamps). In such a situation, we concluded, the Corps could reasonably determine that wetlands adjoining bodies of water were part of those waters. Id., at 135, and n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 455, see also SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 167, 121 S.Ct. 675 (recognizing that Riverside Bayview held that the Corps had  jurisdiction over wetlands that actually abutted on a navigable waterway).",Alito,0,
2022-001,92,"In Rapanos, the plurality spelled out clearly when adjacent wetlands are part of covered waters. It explained that waters may fairly be read to include only those wetlands that are as a practical matter indistinguishable from waters of the United States, such that it is difficult to determine where the `water' ends and the `wetland' begins. 547 U.S., at 742, 755, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (emphasis deleted). That occurs when wetlands have a continuous surface connection to bodies that are `waters of the United States' in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between `waters' and wetlands. Id., at 742, 126 S.Ct. 2208, cf. 33 U.S.C. § 2802(5) (defining coastal waters to include wetlands having unimpaired connection with the open sea up to the head of tidal influence). We agree with this formulation of  when wetlands are part of the waters of the United States. We also acknowledge that temporary interruptions in surface connection may sometimes occur because of phenomena like low tides or dry spells.16",Alito,0,

Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 755, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted). This requires the party asserting jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands to establish first, that the adjacent body of water constitutes  `waters of the United States,' (i.e., a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters), and second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the `water' ends and the `wetland' begins.

See 88 Fed. Reg. 3004. This rule, as noted, provides that adjacent wetlands are covered by the Act if they `possess a significant nexus to' traditional navigable waters. Brief for Respondents 32 (quoting Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 759, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)), see 88 Fed. Reg. 3143.

Beyond that, it clashes with background principles of construction that apply to the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. Bond, 572 U.S., at 857, 134 S.Ct. 2077.

Regulation of land and water use lies at the core of traditional state authority. See, e.g., SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 174, 121 S.Ct. 675 (citing Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30, 44, 115 S.Ct. 394, 130 L.Ed.2d 245 (1994)), Tarrant Regional Water Dist. v. Herrmann, 569 U.S. 614, 631, 133 S.Ct. 2120, 186 L.Ed.2d 153 (2013). An overly broad interpretation of the CWA's reach would impinge on this authority. The area covered by wetlands alone is vast—greater than the combined surface area of California and Texas. And the scope of the EPA's  conception of the waters of the United States is truly staggering when this vast territory is supplemented by all the additional area, some of which is generally dry, over which the Agency asserts jurisdiction. Particularly given the CWA's express policy to preserve the States' primary authority over land and water use, § 1251(b), this Court has required a clear statement from Congress when determining the scope of the waters of the United States. SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 174, 121 S.Ct. 675, accord, Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 738, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion).",Alito,0,
2022-001,100,"The EPA, however, offers only a passing attempt to square its interpretation with the text of § 1362(7), and its significant nexus theory is particularly implausible. It suggests that the meaning of the waters of the United States is so broad and unqualified that, if viewed in isolation, it would extend to all water in the United States. Brief for Respondents 32. The EPA thus turns to the significant nexus test in order to reduce the clash between its understanding of the waters of the United States and the term defined by that phrase, i.e., navigable waters. As discussed, however, the meaning of waters is more limited than the EPA believes. See supra, at 1336. And, in any event, the CWA never mentions the significant nexus test, so the EPA has no statutory basis to impose it. See Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 755-756, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion).",Alito,0,

McDonnell v. United States, 579 U.S. 550, 576, 136 S.Ct. 2355, 195 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016) (quoting Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 402-403, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010)).

And to add to the uncertainty, the test introduces another vague concept—similarly situated waters—and then assesses the aggregate effect of that group based on a variety of open-ended factors that evolve as scientific understandings change. This freewheeling inquiry provides little notice to landowners of their obligations under the CWA. Facing severe criminal sanctions for even negligent violations, property owners are left `to feel their way on a case-by-case basis.'

2022-001,106,"While mustering only a weak textual argument, the EPA justifies its position on two other grounds. It primarily claims that Congress implicitly ratified its interpretation of adjacent wetlands when it adopted § 1344(g)(1). Thus, it argues that waters of the United States covers any wetlands that are bordering, contiguous, or neighboring to covered waters. 88 Fed. Reg. 3143. The principal opinion concurring in the judgment adopts the same position. See post, at 1366-1368 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in judgment). The EPA notes that the Corps had promulgated regulations adopting that interpretation before Congress amended the CWA in 1977 to include the reference to adjacent wetlands in § 1344(g)(1). See 42 Fed. Reg. 37144. This term, the EPA contends, was `obviously transplanted from' the Corps' regulations and thus incorporates the same definition. Brief for Respondents 22 (quoting Taggart v.

2022-001,107,"This argument fails for at least three reasons. First, as we have explained, the text of §§ 1362(7) and 1344(g)(1) shows that adjacent cannot include wetlands that are not part of covered waters. See supra, at 1341.",Alito,0,
2022-001,108,"Second, this ratification theory cannot be reconciled with our cases. We have repeatedly recognized that § 1344(g)(1) `does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on  the relevant definition of navigable waters.' SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 171, 121 S.Ct. 675 (quoting Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 138, n. 11, 106 S.Ct. 455), accord, Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 747-748, n. 12, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion). Additionally, SWANCC rejected the closely analogous argument that Congress ratified the Corps' definition of waters of the United States by including `other  waters' in § 1344(g)(1). 531 U.S., at 168-171, 121 S.Ct. 675. And yet, the EPA's argument would require us to hold that § 1344(g)(1) actually did amend the definition of navigable waters precisely for the reasons we rejected in SWANCC.",Alito,0,
2022-001,109,"Third, the EPA cannot provide the sort of overwhelming evidence of acquiescence necessary to support its argument in the face of Congress's failure to amend § 1362(7). Id., at 169-170, n. 5, 121 S.Ct. 675. We will infer that a term was `transplanted from another legal source' only when a term's meaning was `well-settled' before the transplantation. Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct. 1856, 1864-1865, 213 L.Ed.2d 90 (2022).

McDonough, 596 U.S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1953, 1959, 213 L.Ed.2d 265 (2022) (finding ratification when Congress used an unusual term that had a long regulatory history in the very regulatory context at issue).",Alito,0,

That traditional authority was limited in two ways. First, the water had to be capable of being used as a highway for interstate or foreign commerce. Second, Congress could regulate such waters only for purposes of their navigability—by, for example, regulating obstructions hindering navigable capacity. By the time of the CWA's enactment, the New Deal era arguably had relaxed the second limitation, Congress could regulate navigable waters for a wider range of purposes. But, critically, the statutory terms navigable waters, navigable waters of the United States, and waters of the United States were still understood as invoking only Congress' authority over waters that are, were, or could be used as highways of interstate or foreign commerce.

Thus, today, States enjoy primary sovereignty over their waters, including navigable waters—stemming either from their status as independent sovereigns following Independence, ibid., or their later admission to the Union on an equal footing with the original States, see Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 230, 11 L.Ed. 565 (1845) (The shores of navigable waters, and the soils under them, were not granted by the Constitution to the United States, but were reserved to the states respectively .

The Federal Government therefore possesses no authority over navigable waters except that granted by the Constitution.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,124,"The Federal Government's authority over certain navigable waters is granted and limited by the Commerce Clause, which grants Congress power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. From the beginning, it was understood that the power to regulate commerce, includes the power to regulate navigation, but only as connected with the commerce with foreign nations, and among the states. United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 78, 9 L.Ed. 1004 (1838) (STORY, J., for the Court),  accord, Gibbons v.

In fact, shipping  was at that time the indispensable means for the movement of goods. Barnett 123. The Commerce Clause thus vests Congress with a limited authority over what we now call the channels of interstate commerce. United States v.

2022-001,125,"This federal authority, however, does not displace States' traditional sovereignty over their waters. The power to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States which are accessible from a State other than those in which they lie. Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713, 724-725, 18 L.Ed. 96 (1866) (emphasis added). And, traditionally, this limited authority was confined to regulation of the channels of interstate commerce themselves. Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F.Cas. 546, 550-551 (No. 3,230) (C.C. E.D. Pa. 1823) (WASHINGTON, J., for the Court). It encompassed only the power to keep them open and free from any obstruction to their navigation and to remove such obstructions when they exist. Gilman, 3 Wall. at 725. Thus, any activity that interferes with, obstructs, or prevents such commerce and navigation, though done on land, may be punished by congress. Coombs, 12 Pet. at 78. But, activities that merely affect water-based commerce, such as those regulated by inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a State, are not within Congress' channels-of-commerce authority.

And, this Court was careful to reaffirm that technical title to the beds of the navigable rivers of the United States is either in the States in which the rivers are situated, or in the owners of the land bordering upon such rivers as determined by local law.

The 1894 Act made it unlawful to deposit matter into any harbor or river of the United States that the Federal Government has appropriated  money to improve and prohibited injuring improvements built by the United States in any of its navigable waters. § 6, 28 Stat. 363.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,128,"Congress consolidated and expanded these authorities in the 1899 Act. Section 10 of the Act prohibits the creation of any obstruction  to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States, requires a permit to build structures in any  water of the United States, and makes it unlawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of any water, within the limits of any breakwater, or of the channel of any navigable water of the United States. 30 Stat. 1151 (codified, as amended, at 33 U.S.C. § 403). In addition, § 13 of the Act, sometimes referred to as the Refuse Act, prohibits throwing, discharging, or depositing any refuse matter  into any navigable water of the United States, or into any tributary of any navigable water from which the same shall float or be washed into such navigable water. 30 Stat. 1152 (codified, as amended, at 33 U.S.C. § 407). Section 13 also prohibits depositing material on the bank of any navigable water, or on the bank of any tributary of any navigable water, where the same shall be liable to be washed into such navigable water  whereby navigation shall or may be impeded or obstructed.

Va. 1960).",Thomas,0,
2022-001,130,"Second, Congress asserted its authority only to the extent that obstructions or refuse matter could impede navigation or navigable capacity. Thus, in United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., 174 U.S. 690, 19 S.Ct. 770, 43 L.Ed. 1136 (1899), this Court recognized that any act sought to be enjoined under the 1890 Act must be one which fairly and directly tends to obstruct (that is, interfere with or diminish) the navigable capacity of a stream.

Illinois, 278 U.S. 367, 49 S.Ct. 163, 73 L.Ed. 426 (1929), this Court interpreted the 1899 Act in light of the constitutional prohibition on Congress arbitrarily destroying or impairing the rights of riparian owners by legislation which has no real or substantial relation to the control of navigation or appropriateness to that end. Id., at 415, 49 S.Ct. 163.1 The touchstone, thus, remained actual navigation.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,131,"Third, § 13 of the Act requires some form of surface water connection between a tributary and traditionally navigable waters. See 33 U.S.C. § 407 (prohibiting depositing refuse into any tributary of any navigable water from which the same shall float or be washed into such navigable water). To be sure, the Refuse Act also prohibits leaving refuse on the bank of any navigable water, or on the bank of any tributary of any navigable water, where the same shall be liable to be washed into such navigable water. Ibid. But, this prohibition reflects nothing more than Congress' traditional authority to regulate acts done on land that directly impair the navigability of traditionally navigable waters. See Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., 174 U.S., at 708, 19 S.Ct. 770 (explaining that the Act reaches any obstruction to the navigable capacity, and anything, wherever done or however done,  which tends to destroy the navigable capacity of one of the navigable waters of the United States), see also Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 104 F. 691, 693 (C.A.8 1900), Coombs, 12 Pet. at 78. It does not mean that the land itself is a navigable water.2",Thomas,0,
2022-001,132,"The history of federal regulation of navigable waters demonstrates that Congress' authority over navigation, as traditionally understood, was narrow but deep. It only applied to a discrete set of navigable waters and could only be used to keep those waters open for interstate commerce. See Port of Seattle, 255 U.S., at 63, 41 S.Ct. 237, Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., 174 U.S., at 709, 19 S.Ct. 770. Yet, where Congress had authority, it displaced the States' traditional sovereignty over their navigable waters and allowed Congress to regulate activities even on land that could directly cause obstructions to navigable capacity.

2022-001,133,"In light of the depth of this new federal power, it was carefully limited—mere effects on interstate commerce were not sufficient to trigger Congress' navigation authority.

2022-001,134,"To make a particular branch of commerce or trade within a state, a part of the commerce among the several states, it would not be sufficient that it was remotely connected with that commerce among the several states, for almost everything and every occupation and employment in life are remotely connected with that commerce or navigation. And if congress has the right to regulate every employment or pursuit thus remotely connected with that commerce, of which they have the control, then it has the right to regulate nearly the entire business and employment of the citizens of the several states . Yet, if congress has the power to regulate all these employments, and a thousand others equally connected with that commerce, then it can regulate nearly all the  concerns of life, and nearly all the employments of the citizens of the several states, and the state governments might as well be abolished. It is not sufficient, then, that navigation, or trade, or business of any kind, within a state, be remotely connected, or, perhaps, connected at all with `commerce with foreign nations, or among the several states, or with the Indian tribes,' it should be a part of that commerce, to authorize congress to regulate it.

2022-001,135,"The Court's observation that federal regulation was largely limited to ensuring that `traditional navigable waters'  remained free of impediments, ante, at 1330, thus does no more than reflect the original understanding of the federal authority over navigable waters.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,137,"As noted above, the scope of Congress' authority over waters was defined by the traditional concept of navigability, imported with significant modifications from the English common law.3 Thus, Congress could regulate only navigable waters. Consistent with that backdrop, the term navigable waters—used interchangeably with waters of the United States and navigable waters of the United States— referred to the waters subject to Congress' traditional authority over navigable waters until the enactment of the CWA.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,139,"The term navigable waters has been in use since the founding to refer to the highways of commerce that were key to the Nation's development. Great cities like Philadelphia and St. Louis emerged at first as commercial ports along these navigable waters. The Framers recognized that Providence has in a particular manner blessed our country with a succession of navigable waters that bind the Nation together, while the most noble rivers in the world, running at convenient distances, present Americans with highways for the easy communication of friendly aids and the mutual transportation and exchange of their various commodities. The Federalist No. 2, p. 38 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Jay). These vast rivers, stretching far inland have been of transcendent importance to our Nation's economic expansion by forming great highways for commerce. L. Houck, Law of Navigable Rivers xiii (1868).",Thomas,0,
2022-001,140,"This Court authoritatively set out the scope of the term navigable waters of the United States in the seminal case of The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 19 L.Ed. 999 (1871). That case arose under the Steamboat Act of 1838, which prohibited the transportation of goods upon the bays, lakes, rivers, or other navigable waters of the United States. § 2, 5 Stat. 304. This Court held that the term navigable refers to waters that are navigable in fact, meaning that they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over  which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water. The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. at 563. The Court then explained that navigable waters are of the United States, in contradistinction from the navigable waters of the States, when they form in their ordinary condition by themselves, or by uniting with other waters, a continued highway over which commerce is or may be carried on with other States or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water. Ibid., see also The Montello, 11 Wall. 411, 415, 20 L.Ed. 191 (1871) (If  the river is not of itself a highway for commerce with other States or foreign countries, or does not form such highway by its connection with other waters, and is only navigable between different places within the State, then it is not a navigable water of the United States, but only a navigable water of the State). It is this junction between waters to form a continued highway for commerce, both with other States and with foreign countries, that brings the water under the direct control of Congress in the exercise of its commercial power. The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. at 564. The definition of a navigable water of the United States was thus linked directly to the limits on Congress' commerce authority: A navigable water of the United States was one that was ordinarily used for interstate or foreign commerce.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,141,"Wetlands were generally excluded from this definition. In Leovy v. United States, 177 U.S. 621, 20 S.Ct. 797, 44 L.Ed. 914 (1900), for example, the Court employed the Daniel Ball test to hold that the term navigable waters of the United States, as used in the 1890 River and Harbor Act, did not prevent the exercise by the State of Louisiana of its power to reclaim swamp and overflowed lands by regulating and controlling the current of small streams not used habitually as arteries of interstate commerce. 177 U.S., at 632, 20 S.Ct. 797. The Court observed that applying the Act to wetlands reclamation would extend the paramount jurisdiction of the United States over all the flowing waters in the States. Id., at 633, 20 S.Ct. 797. If such were the necessary construction of the term navigable water, the Court explained, the River and Harbor Act's validity might well be questioned. Ibid. But, the Court declined to interpret the Act to reach the wetlands, because it recognized that the phrase navigable waters of the United States encompassed only those waters reached by the traditional channels-of-commerce authority:",Thomas,0,
2022-001,142,"When it is remembered that the source of the power of the general government to act at all in this matter arises out of its power to regulate commerce with foreign countries and among the States, it is obvious that what the Constitution and the acts of Congress have in view is the promotion and protection of commerce in its international and interstate aspect, and a practical construction must be put on these enactments as intended for such large and important purposes. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,143,"The Court thus held that the mere use of a wetland by fishermen was not sufficient to make the wetland a navigable water of the United States, it was not shown that passengers were ever carried through it, or that freight destined to any other State than Louisiana, or, indeed, destined for any market in Louisiana, was ever, much less habitually, carried through it. Id., at 627, 20 S.Ct. 797.4  The Daniel Ball test, with minor variations, marked the limits of federal jurisdiction over waters up to the enactment of the CWA. For instance, in Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, 256 U.S. 113, 41 S.Ct. 409, 65 L.Ed. 847 (1921), the Court applied The Daniel Ball but expanded it to hold that the River and Harbor Act of 1899 reaches waters that are not currently capable of supporting interstate commerce, though they once did. 256 U.S., at 123-124, 41 S.Ct. 409. And, in United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S. 377, 61 S.Ct. 291, 85 L.Ed. 243 (1940), the Court applied The Daniel Ball to reach waters that could be made navigable with reasonable and feasible improvement. 311 U.S., at 408-409, 61 S.Ct. 291. While these cases expanded the outer boundaries of the term, creating an expanded form of the Daniel Ball test, they reflect the Court's longstanding view that the statutory term navigable water required application of the Daniel Ball test.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,145,"In the New Deal era, as is well known, this Court adopted a greatly expanded conception of Congress' commerce authority by permitting Congress to regulate any private intrastate activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, either by itself or when aggregated with many similar activities. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 127-129, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942), see also United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 119, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941). Yet, this expansion did not fundamentally change the Court's understanding that the term navigable waters referred to waters used for interstate commerce. Thus, in Appalachian Elec., the Court continued to apply the concept of navigability to determine the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause authority to require licenses under the Federal Water Power Act for the construction of hydroelectric dams in navigable waters. 311 U.S., at 406-410, 61 S.Ct. 291. Only after applying the Daniel Ball definition to determine that the river in question was navigable did the Court hold that Congress had plenary authority over the erection of structures in the river, regardless of whether the structure actually impeded navigability. 311 U.S., at 423-426, 61 S.Ct. 291. While this represented an expansive application of the old concept that Congress can prevent obstructions to navigable capacity, see supra, at 1346, 1347-1348, Appalachian Elec. made clear that the term navigable waters remained tethered to Congress' traditional channels-of-commerce authority—not to the broader conceptions of the commerce authority adopted by the Court at that time.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,146,"The next year, in Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 313 U.S. 508, 61 S.Ct. 1050, 85 L.Ed. 1487 (1941), the Court reaffirmed that the term navigable waters, this time as used in the Flood Control Act of 1936, was to be interpreted in light of the expanded Daniel Ball test. 313 U.S., at 522-525, 61 S.Ct. 1050. Significantly, Oklahoma was decided mere months after Darby, one of the most significant cases expanding the scope of the commerce authority. 312 U.S., at 119, 61  S.Ct. 451. However, Oklahoma did not so much as mention Darby in construing the jurisdiction Congress conveyed in the term navigable waters. Instead, it cited Darby only in passing and to support the argument that, once a river is deemed navigable under the channels-of-commerce authority, Congress has authority to protect the nation's arteries of commerce by regulating intrastate activities on nonnavigable parts and tributaries of the navigable river lest such activities impair navigation itself. Oklahoma, 313 U.S., at 525, 61 S.Ct. 1050. This was nothing more than an application of the principle that Congress can regulate activities that obstruct navigable capacity. Thus, even as the Court expanded the Commerce Clause in other contexts, it continued to understand that the term navigable waters refers solely to the aquatic channels of interstate commerce over which Congress traditionally exercised authority.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,148,"This understanding of the term navigable waters—i.e., as shorthand for waters subject to Congress' authority under the Daniel Ball test—persisted up to the enactment of the CWA. See, e.g., Stoeco Homes, Inc., 498 F.2d at 608-609, United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc., 478 F.2d 418, 428-429 (C.A.5 1973), see also D. Guinn, An Analysis of Navigable Waters of the United States, 18 Baylor L. Rev. 559, 579 (1966) (The test of The Daniel Ball and Appalachian Power Co. are religiously cited as being the basis for the holding on the issue of navigability). As a court observed near the time of the CWA's enactment, although the definition of `navigability' laid down in The Daniel Ball has subsequently been modified and clarified, its definition of `navigable water of the United States,' insofar as it requires a navigable interstate linkage by water, appears to remain unchanged. Hardy Salt Co. v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., 501 F.2d 1156, 1167 (C.A.10 1974) (citations omitted). This Court's cases, too, continued to apply traditional navigability concepts in cases under the River and Harbor Acts right up to the CWA's enactment. See United States v. Standard Oil Co., 384 U.S. 224, 226, 86 S.Ct. 1427, 16 L.Ed.2d 492 (1966) (holding that spilling oil in a navigable water was prohibited by the Refuse Act (§ 13 of the 1899 Act) because its presence in our rivers and harbors is both a menace to navigation and a pollutant), United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482, 487-491, 80 S.Ct. 884, 4 L.Ed.2d 903 (1960) (diminution of the navigable capacity of a waterway required for violation of the Refuse Act). Thus, on the eve of the CWA's enactment, the term navigable waters meant those waters that are, were, or could be used as highways of interstate or foreign commerce.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,150,"This history demonstrates that Congress was not writing on a blank slate in the CWA, which defines federal jurisdiction using the same terms used in the River and Harbor Acts: navigable waters and the waters of the United States, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1362(7), (12). As explained above, courts and Congress had long used the terms navigable water, navigable water of the United States, and the waters of the United States interchangeably to signify those waters to which the traditional channels-of-commerce authority extended. See supra, at 1347. The terms navigable waters and waters of the United States shared a core requirement that the water be a highway over which commerce is or may be carried, with the term of the United States doing the independent work of requiring that such commerce be carried on with other States or foreign countries.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,151,"The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. at 563. The text of the CWA thus reflects the traditional balance between federal and state authority over navigable waters, as set out by The Daniel Ball. It would be strange indeed if Congress sought to effect a fundamental transformation of federal jurisdiction over water through phrases that had been in use to describe the traditional scope of that jurisdiction for well over a century and that carried a well-understood meaning.5",Thomas,0,
2022-001,152,"The Army Corps of Engineers originally understood the CWA in precisely this way. In its 1974 regulation establishing the first CWA § 404 permitting program,6 the Corps interpreted the term the waters of the United States to establish jurisdiction over the traditional navigable waters as determined by the expanded Daniel Ball test, noting also that the term is limited by Congress' navigation authority. 39 Fed. Reg. 12115. The Corps anchored its jurisdiction in the expanded Daniel Ball test, defining navigable waters to include those waters of the United States which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be in the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or foreign commerce. 33 C.F.R. § 209.120(d)(1) (1974), see also §§ 209.260(d)(1)-(3) (requiring past, present, or potential presence of interstate or foreign commerce, physical capabilities for use by commerce, and defined geographic limits of the water body). The regulations also made clear that traditional navigability factors were the baseline for CWA jurisdiction: It is the water body's capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation or commerce which is the determinative factor. § 209.260(e)(1).",Thomas,0,
2022-001,153,"Almost immediately, however, a few courts and the recently created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rejected this interpretation. Instead, they interpreted the CWA to assert the full extent of Congress' New Deal era authority to regulate anything that substantially affects interstate commerce by itself or in the aggregate. See United States v. Ashland Oil & Transp. Co., 504 F.2d 1317, 1323-1329 (C.A.6 1974), P. F. Z. Properties, Inc. v. Train, 393 F.Supp. 1370, 1381 (D.C. 1975), Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Callaway, 392 F. Supp. 685, 686 (D.C. 1975), United States v. Holland, 373 F.Supp. 665, 669, 672-674 (M.D. Fla. 1974), 40 C.F.R. § 125.1(o) (1974) (initial EPA CWA definition). The courts that reached this conclusion relied almost exclusively on legislative history and statutory purpose. See, e.g., Holland, 373 F.Supp. at 672 (The foregoing legislative history compels the Court to conclude that the former test of navigability was indeed defined away in the CWA). But signals from legislative history cannot rebut clear statutory  text, and the text of the CWA employs words that had long been universally understood to reach only those waters subject to Congress' channels-of-commerce authority. See supra, at 1352.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,154,"These courts and the EPA had only one textual hook for their interpretation: In defining the term navigable waters as the waters of the United States, the CWA seemed to drop the term navigable from the operative part of the definition. Seizing on this phrasing, the EPA's general counsel asserted in 1973 that the deletion of the word `navigable' eliminates the requirement of navigability. The only remaining requirement, then, is that pollution of waters covered by the bill must be capable of affecting interstate commerce. 1 EPA Gen. Counsel Op. 295 (1973). Similarly, the District Court that vacated the Corps' original CWA definition held, without any analysis or citation, that the term the waters of the United States in the CWA is not limited to the traditional tests of navigability. Natural Resources Defense Council, 392 F.Supp. at 671.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,155,"That interpretation cannot be right. For one, the terms navigable waters and the waters of the United States had long been used synonymously by courts and Congress. The CWA simply used the terms in the same manner as the River and Harbor Acts. Moreover, no source prior to the CWA had ever asserted that the term the waters of the United States, when not modified by navigable, reached any water that may affect interstate commerce. Instead, The Daniel Ball made clear that the phrase `waters of the United States, in contradistinction from the navigable waters of the States,'  distinguishes interstate from intrastate waters. Albrecht & Nickelsburg 11049 (quoting The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. at 563), accord, 1 A. Knauth, Benedict on Admiralty § 44, p. 96 (6th ed. 1940) (The inland lakes of various States are navigable but, having no navigable outlet linking them with our system of water-ways, have never been held to be public waters of the United States (emphasis added)). The text of the CWA extends jurisdiction to navigable waters, and— precisely tracking The Daniel Ball—clarifies that it reaches the waters of the United States, rather than the navigable waters of the States.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,156,"Thus, the CWA's use of the phrase the waters of the United States reinforces, rather than lessens, the need for a water to be at least part of a continued highway over which commerce is or may be carried on with other States or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water. The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. at 563. At most, the omission of the word navigable signifies that the CWA adopts the expanded Daniel Ball-test —that includes waters that are, have been, or can be reasonably made navigable in fact—in its statutory provisions. The Federal Government's interpretation, by contrast, renders the use of the term navigable a nullity and involves an unprecedented and extravagant reading of the well-understood term of art the waters of the United States. See Albrecht & Nickelsburg 11049 (EPA's conclusion is ahistorical as well as illogical).7 The waters  of the United States does not mean any water in the United States.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,157,"There would be little need to explain any of this if the agencies had not effectively flouted our decision in SWANCC, which restored navigability as the touchstone of federal jurisdiction under the CWA, and rejected the key arguments supporting an expansive interpretation of the CWA's text. We expressly held that Congress' use of the phrase `waters of the United States' in the CWA is not a basis for reading the term `navigable waters' out of the statute—directly contradicting the EPA's 1973 interpretation, upon which every subsequent expansion of its authority has been based. 531 U.S., at 172, 121 S.Ct. 675. We also held that the Corps did not mistake Congress' intent when it promulgated its 1974 regulations, under which `the determinative factor' for navigability was a `water body's capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation or commerce.' Id., at 168, 121 S.Ct. 675 (quoting 33 C.F.R. § 209.260(e)(1)). In doing so, we rejected reliance on the CWA's ambiguous legislative history, which the EPA had used to expand the definition of `navigable waters' to the outer limit of the commerce authority as interpreted in the New Deal. 531 U.S., at 168, n. 3, 121 S.Ct. 675.8 Instead, we made clear that Congress did not intend to exert anything more than its commerce power over navigation. Ibid., see also id., at 173, 121 S.Ct. 675 (rejecting the Government's argument that the CWA invokes Congress' power to regulate intrastate activities that `substantially affect' interstate commerce).",Thomas,0,
2022-001,158,"SWANCC thus interpreted the text of the CWA as implementing Congress' traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made—i.e., the expanded Daniel Ball test. 531 U.S., at 172, 121 S.Ct. 675 (citing Appalachian Elec., 311 U.S., at 407-408, 61 S.Ct. 291).9  And, consistent with the traditional link between navigability and the limits of Congress' regulatory authority, SWANCC noted that any broader interpretation would raise significant constitutional and federalism questions and result in a significant impingement of the States' traditional and primary authority over land and water use. 531 U.S., at 174, 121 S.Ct. 675. Both in its holdings and in its mode of analysis, SWANCC cannot be reconciled with the agencies' sharp departure from the centuries-old understanding of navigability and the traditional limits of Congress' channels-of-commerce authority.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,159,"In sum, the plain text of the CWA and our opinion in SWANCC demonstrate that the CWA must be interpreted in light of Congress' traditional authority over navigable waters. See Albrecht & Nickelsburg 11055 (noting that SWANCC states more than once that Congress' use of the term `navigable waters' signifies that Congress intended to exercise its traditional authority over navigable waters, and not its broader power over all things that substantially affect commerce). Yet, for decades, the EPA (of its own license) and the Corps (under the compulsion of an unreasoned and since discredited District Court order) have issued substantively identical regulatory definitions of the waters of the United States that completely ignore navigability and instead expand the CWA's coverage to the outer limits of the Court's New Deal-era Commerce Clause precedents.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,161,"This case demonstrates the unbounded breadth of the jurisdiction that the EPA and the Corps have asserted under the CWA. The regulatory definition applied to the Sacketts' property declares intrastate waters, wetlands, and various other wet things to be waters of the United States if their use, degradation or destruction could affect interstate or foreign commerce. 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(s)(3) (2008) (emphasis added). To leave no doubt that the agencies have entirely broken from traditional navigable waters, they give several examples of qualifying waters: those that are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers for recreational or other purposes, those from which fish or shellfish are or could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce, those that are used or could be used for industrial purposes by industries in interstate commerce, tributaries of any such waters, and wetlands adjacent to any such waters. §§ 230.3(s)(3)(i)-(iii), (5), (7). This definition and others like it are premised on the fallacy repudiated in SWANCC: that the text of the CWA expands federal jurisdiction beyond Congress' traditional commerce power over navigation. 531 U.S., at 168, n. 3, 121 S.Ct. 675.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,162,"Nonetheless, under these boundless standards, the agencies have asserted jurisdiction over virtually any parcel of land containing a channel or conduit  through which rainwater or drainage may occasionally or intermittently flow, including  storm drains, roadside ditches, ripples of sand in the desert that may contain water once a year, and lands that are covered by floodwaters once every 100 years. Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 722, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion). The agencies' definition engulfs entire cities and immense arid wastelands alike. Ibid. Indeed, because the entire land area of the United States lies in some drainage basin, and an endless network of visible channels furrows the entire surface, any plot of land containing such a channel may potentially be regulated. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,163,"If this interpretation were correct, the only prudent move for any landowner in America would be to ask the Federal Government for permission before undertaking any kind of development. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 86, 116-117. This regime turns Congress' traditionally limited navigation authority on its head. The baseline under the Constitution, the CWA, and the Court's precedents is state control of waters. See SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 174, 121 S.Ct. 675 (reaffirming the States' traditional and primary power over land and water use), Leovy, 177 U.S., at 633, 20 S.Ct. 797 (repudiating an interpretation of the 1899 Act that would render practically every creek or stream in the entire country a navigable water of the United States and subject the officers and agents of a State  to fine and imprisonment for draining a swamp unless permission was first obtained from the Secretary of War). By contrast, the agencies' interpretation amounts to a federal police power, exercised in the most aggressive possible way.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,164,"Thankfully, applying well-established navigability rules makes this a straightforward case. The wetlands on the Sacketts' property are not waters of the United States for several independently sufficient reasons. First, for the reasons set out by the Court, the Sacketts' wetlands are not waters because they lack a continuous surface connection with a traditional navigable water. See ante, at 1343-1344. Second, the nonnavigable so-called tributary (really, a roadside ditch) across the street from the Sacketts' property is not a water of the United States because it is not, has never been, and cannot reasonably be made a highway of interstate or foreign commerce. See SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 172, 121 S.Ct. 675. Third, the agencies have not attempted to establish that Priest Lake is a navigable water under the expanded Daniel Ball test. The lake is purely intra-state, and the agencies have not shown that it is a highway of interstate or foreign commerce. Instead, the agencies rely primarily upon interstate tourism and the lake's attenuated connection to navigable waters. See U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, G. Rayner, Priest Lake Jurisdictional Determination (Feb. 27, 2007), see also Brief for National Association of Home Builders of the United States as Amicus Curiae 21-24. But, this is likely insufficient under the traditional navigability tests to which the CWA pegs jurisdiction. See supra, at 1349-1351, accord, Tr. of Oral Arg. 119 (EPA counsel conceding that Congress hasn't used its full Commerce Clause authority in the CWA). Finally, even assuming that a navigable water is involved, the agencies have not established that the Sacketts' actions would obstruct or otherwise impede navigable capacity or the suitability of the water for interstate commerce. See Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., 174 U.S., at 709, 19 S.Ct. 770.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,165,"This is not to say that determining whether a water qualifies under the CWA is always easy. But, it is vital that we ask the right question in determining what constitutes the waters of the United States: whether the water is within Congress' traditional authority over the interstate channels of commerce. Here, no elaborate  analysis is required to know that the Sacketts' land is not a water, much less a water of the United States.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,167,"What happened to the CWA is indicative of deeper problems with the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The eclipse of Congress' well-defined authority over the channels of interstate commerce tracks the Court's expansion of Congress' power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. As I have explained at length, the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence has significantly departed from the original meaning of the Constitution. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 58-59, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (dissenting opinion), Lopez, 514 U.S., at 586-602, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (concurring opinion). The Clause's text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term `commerce consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.' Raich, 545 U.S., at 58, 125 S.Ct. 2195. This meaning stood in contrast to productive activities like manufacturing and agriculture, and founding era sources demonstrate that the term `commerce' was consistently used to mean trade or exchange—not all economically gainful activity that has some attenuated connection to trade or exchange. Ibid. (citing Lopez, 514 U.S., at 586-587, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (THOMAS, J., concurring), Barnett 112-125).10 By departing from this limited meaning, the Court's cases have licensed federal regulatory schemes that would have been unthinkable to the Constitution's Framers and ratifiers. Raich, 545 U.S., at 59, 125 S.Ct. 2195 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).",Thomas,0,
2022-001,168,"Perhaps nowhere is this deviation more evident than in federal environmental law, much of which is uniquely dependent upon an expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 281-283, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981), see also Brief for Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence as Amicus Curiae 17-25. And many environmental regulatory schemes seem to push even the limits of the Court's New Deal era Commerce Clause precedents, see Hodel, 452 U.S., at 309-313, 101 S.Ct. 2352 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment), to say nothing of the Court's more recent precedents reining in the commerce power. See, e.g., SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 173-174, 121 S.Ct. 675, cf. Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton, 334 F.3d 1158, 1160 (C.A.D.C. 2003) (ROBERTS, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (The panel's approach in this case leads to the result that regulating the taking under the Endangered Species Act of a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California constitutes regulating `Commerce among the several States' (ellipsis omitted)).",Thomas,0,
2022-001,169,"The Court's opinion today curbs a serious expansion of federal authority that has simultaneously degraded States' authority  and diverted the Federal Government from its important role as guarantor of the Nation's great commercial water highways into something resembling a local zoning board. Rapanos, 547 U.S., at 738, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (plurality opinion). But, wetlands are just the beginning of the problems raised by the agencies' assertion of jurisdiction in this case. Despite our clear guidance in SWANCC that the CWA extends only to the limits of Congress' traditional jurisdiction over navigable waters, the EPA and the Corps have continued to treat the statute as if it were based on New Deal era conceptions of Congress' commerce power. But, while not all environmental statutes are so textually limited, Congress chose to tether federal jurisdiction under the CWA to its traditional authority over navigable waters. The EPA and the Corps must respect that decision.",Thomas,0,
2022-001,170,"Justice KAGAN, with whom Justice SOTOMAYOR and Justice JACKSON join, concurring in the judgment.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,171,"Like Justice KAVANAUGH, I would stick to the text. Post, at 1369 (opinion concurring in judgment). As he explains in the principal concurrence, our normal method of construing statutes identifies which wetlands the Clean Water Act covers —and the answer provided exceeds what the Court says today. Because the Act covers the waters of the United States, and those waters include all wetlands adjacent to other covered waters, the Act extends to those adjacent wetlands. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1362(7), 1344(g)(1). And in ordinary language, one thing is adjacent to another not only when it is touching, but also when it is nearby. See post, at 1363-1364 (quoting multiple dictionaries). So, for example, one house is adjacent to another even when a stretch of grass and a picket fence separate the two. As applied here, that means—as the EPA and Army Corps have recognized for almost half a century—that a wetland comes within the Act if (i) it is contiguous to or bordering a covered water, or (ii) if it is separated from a covered water only by a man-made dike or barrier, natural river berm, beach dune, or the like. Post, at 1369 (emphasis in original). In excluding all the wetlands in category (ii), the majority's `continuous surface connection' test disregards the ordinary meaning of `adjacent.' Post, at 1366. The majority thus alters—more precisely, narrows the scope of—the statute Congress drafted.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,172,"And make no mistake: Congress wrote the statute it meant to. The Clean Water Act was a landmark piece of environmental legislation, designed to address a problem of crisis proportions. R. Adler, J. Landman, & D. Cameron, The Clean Water Act: 20 Years Later 5 (1993). How bad was water pollution in 1972, when the Act passed? Just a few years earlier, Ohio's Cuyahoga River had burst into flames, fueled by oil and other industrial wastes. Ibid. And that was merely one of many alarms. Rivers, lakes, and creeks across the country were unfit for swimming. Drinking water was full of hazardous chemicals. Fish were dying in record numbers (over 40 million in 1969), and those caught were often too contaminated to eat (with mercury and DDT far above safe levels). See id., at 5-6. So Congress embarked on what this Court once understood as a total restructuring and complete rewriting of existing water pollution law. Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 317, 101 S.Ct. 1784, 68 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). The new Act established a self-consciously comprehensive and all-encompassing program of water pollution regulation. Id., at 318-319, 101 S.Ct. 1784. Or said a bit differently, the Act created a program broad enough to achieve the codified objective of restoring and maintaining the  chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. § 1251(a). If you've lately swum in a lake, happily drunk a glass of water straight from the tap, or sat down to a good fish dinner, you can appreciate what the law has accomplished.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,173,"Vital to the Clean Water Act's project is the protection of wetlands—both those contiguous to covered waters and others nearby. As this Court (again, formerly) recognized, wetlands serve to filter and purify water draining into adjacent bodies of water, and to slow the flow of surface runoff into lakes, rivers, and streams. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 134, 106 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985) (citation omitted). Wetlands thus function as integral parts of the aquatic environment—protecting neighboring water if themselves healthy, imperiling neighboring water if instead degraded. Id., at 135, 106 S.Ct. 455. At the same time, wetlands play a crucial part in flood control (if anything, more needed now than when the statute was enacted). And wetlands perform those functions, as Justice KAVANAUGH explains, not only when they are touching a covered water but also when they are separated from it by a natural or artificial barrier—say, a berm or dune or dike or levee. See post, at 1368 (giving examples). Those barriers, as he says, do not block all water flow, and in fact are usually evidence of a significant connection between the wetland and the water. Ibid. Small wonder, then, that the Act—as written, rather than as read today—covers wetlands with that kind of connection. Congress chose just the word needed to meet the Act's objective. A wetland is protected when it is adjacent to a covered water—not merely when it is adjoining or contiguous or touching, or (in the majority's favorite made-up locution) has a continuous surface connection. See, e.g., ante, at 1343-1344.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,174,"Today's majority, though, believes Congress went too far. In the majority's view, the Act imposes unjustifiably crushing consequences for violations of its terms. Ante, at 1330. And many of those violations, it thinks, are of no real concern, arising from mundane land-use conduct like moving dirt. Ante, at 1335-1336. Congress, the majority scolds, has unleashed the EPA to regulate swimming pools and puddles, wreaking untold havoc on a staggering array of landowners. Ante, at 1329, 1335. Surely something has to be done, and who else to do it but this Court? It must rescue property owners from Congress's too-ambitious program of pollution control.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,175,"So the majority shelves the usual rules of interpretation—reading the text, determining what the words used there mean, and applying that ordinary understanding even if it conflicts with judges' policy preferences. The majority's first pass through the statute is, as Justice KAVANAUGH says, unorthodox. Post, at 1366. A minus B, which includes C? Ante, at 1339. The majority could use every letter of the alphabet, and graduate to quadratic equations, and still not solve its essential problem. As the majority concedes, the statute tells us that at least some wetlands must qualify as `waters of the United States.' Ante, at 1339. More, the statute tells us what those some wetlands are: the adjacent ones. And again, as Justice KAVANAUGH shows, adjacent does not mean adjoining. See post, at 1363-1365, supra, at 1359-1360. So the majority proceeds to its back-up plan. It relies as well on a judicially manufactured clear-statement rule. When Congress (so says the majority) exercises power over private property —particularly, over land and water use—it must adopt exceedingly clear language.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,176,"Ante, at 1341 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is, in other words, a thumb on the scale for property owners— no matter that the Act (i.e., the one Congress enacted) is all about stopping property owners from polluting. See supra, at 1359-1360.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,177,"Even assuming that thumb's existence, the majority still would be wrong. As Justice KAVANAUGH notes, clear-statement rules operate (when they operate) to resolve problems of ambiguity and vagueness. See post, at 1367, see also Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 859, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). And no such problems are evident here. One last time: Adjacent means neighboring, whether or not touching, so, for example, a wetland is adjacent to water on the other side of a sand dune. That congressional judgment is as clear as clear can be—which is to say, as clear as language gets. And so a clear-statement rule must leave it alone. The majority concludes otherwise because it is using its thumb not to resolve ambiguity or clarify vagueness, but instead to correct breadth. Those paying attention have seen this move before—actually, just last Term. In another case of environmental regulation (involving clean air), the Court invoked another clear-statement rule (the so-called major questions doctrine) to diminish another plainly expansive term (system of emission reduction). See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. ___, ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2587, 2599-2600, 2609, 213 L.Ed.2d 896 (2022). Contra the majority, I said then, a broad term is not the same thing as a `vague' one. Id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2630 (dissenting opinion). And a court must treat the two differently. A court may, on occasion, apply a clear-statement rule to deal with statutory vagueness or ambiguity. But a court may not rewrite Congress's plain instructions because they go further than preferred. That is what the majority does today in finding that the Clean Water Act excludes many wetlands (clearly) adjacent to covered waters.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,178,"And still more fundamentally, why ever have a thumb on the scale against the Clean Water Act's protections? The majority first invokes federalism. See ante, at 1341-1342. But as Justice KAVANAUGH observes, the Federal Government has long regulated the waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. Post, at 1367. The majority next raises the specter of criminal penalties for indeterminate conduct. See ante, at 1342-1343. But there is no peculiar indeterminacy in saying—as regulators have said for nearly a half century—that a wetland is covered both when it touches a covered water and when it is separated by only a dike, berm, dune, or similar barrier. (That standard is in fact more definite than a host of criminal laws I could name.) Today's pop-up clear-statement rule is explicable only as a reflexive response to Congress's enactment of an ambitious scheme of environmental regulation. It is an effort to cabin the anti-pollution actions Congress thought appropriate. See ante, at 1341-1342 (complaining about Congress's protection of vast and staggering additional area). And that, too, recalls last Term, when I remarked on special canons magically appearing as get-out-of-text-free cards to stop the EPA from taking the measures Congress told it to. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2641-2642 (dissenting opinion). There, the majority's non-textualism barred the EPA from addressing climate change by curbing power plant emissions in the most effective way. Here, that method prevents the EPA from keeping our country's waters clean by regulating adjacent wetlands. The vice in both instances is the same: the Court's  appointment of itself as the national decision-maker on environmental policy.",Kagan,0,
2022-001,179,"So I'll conclude, sadly, by repeating what I wrote last year, with the replacement of only a single word. The Court substitutes its own ideas about policymaking for Congress's. The Court will not allow the Clean Water Act to work as Congress instructed. The Court, rather than Congress, will decide how much regulation is too much. Id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2643. Because that is not how I think our Government should work—more, because it is not how the Constitution thinks our Government should work—I respectfully concur in the judgment only.",Kagan,0,

2022-001,183,"I agree with the Court's reversal of the Ninth Circuit.

2022-001,184,"I write separately because I respectfully disagree with the Court's new test for assessing when wetlands are covered by the Clean Water Act. The Court concludes that wetlands are covered by the Act only when the wetlands have a continuous surface connection to waters of the United States—that is, when the wetlands are adjoining covered waters. Ante, at 1339-1340, 1341 (internal quotation marks omitted). In my view, the Court's continuous surface connection test departs from the statutory text, from 45 years of consistent agency practice, and from this Court's precedents. The Court's test narrows the Clean Water Act's coverage of adjacent wetlands to mean only adjoining wetlands. But adjacent and adjoining have distinct meanings: Adjoining wetlands are contiguous to or bordering a covered water, whereas adjacent wetlands include both (i) those wetlands contiguous to or bordering a covered water, and (ii) wetlands separated from a covered water only by a man-made dike or barrier, natural river berm, beach dune, or the like. By narrowing the Act's coverage of wetlands to only adjoining wetlands, the Court's new test will leave some long-regulated adjacent wetlands no longer covered by the Clean Water Act, with significant repercussions for water quality and flood control throughout the United States.

2022-001,190,"So the question here becomes the meaning of adjacent wetlands under the Clean Water Act. As a matter of ordinary meaning and longstanding agency practice, a wetland is adjacent to a covered water (i) if the wetland is adjoining—that is, contiguous to or bordering—a covered water—or (ii) if the wetland is separated from a covered water only by a man-made dike or barrier, natural river berm, beach dune, or the like.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,191,"The Court and I agree that wetlands in the first category—that is, wetlands adjoining a covered water—are covered as adjacent wetlands. Ante, at 1339-1341. But the Court and I disagree about the second category—that is, wetlands separated from a covered water only by a man-made dike or barrier, natural river berm, beach dune, or the like. The Court concludes that wetlands in that second category are not covered as adjacent wetlands because those wetlands do not have a continuous surface connection to a covered water—in other words, those wetlands are not adjoining the covered water. I disagree because the statutory text (adjacent) does not require a continuous surface connection between those wetlands and covered waters.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,192,"The ordinary meaning of the term adjacent has not changed since Congress amended the Clean Water Act in 1977 to expressly cover wetlands adjacent to waters of the United States. 91 Stat. 1601, 33 U.S.C. § 1344(g). Then as now, adjacent  means lying near or close to, neighboring, or not widely separated. Indeed, the definitions of adjacent are notably explicit that two things need not touch each other in order to be adjacent. Adjacent includes adjoining but is not limited to adjoining. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 62 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (defining adjacent as Lying near or close to, sometimes, contiguous, neighboring,  may not actually touch), Black's Law Dictionary 50 (11th ed. 2019) (defining adjacent as Lying near or close to, but not necessarily touching), see also, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 26 (1976) (defining adjacent as to lie near, border on, not distant or far off , nearby but not touching).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,193,"By contrast to the Clean Water Act's express inclusion of adjacent wetlands, other provisions of the Act use the narrower term adjoining. Compare 33 U.S.C. § 1344(g) with §§ 1321(b)-(c) (adjoining shorelines and adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters), § 1346(c) (land adjoining the coastal recreation waters), see also § 1254(n)(4) (estuary includes certain bodies of water having unimpaired natural connection with open sea), § 2802(5) (`coastal waters' includes wetlands having unimpaired connection with the open sea up to the head of tidal influence). The difference in those two terms is critical to this case. Two objects are adjoining if they are so joined or united to each other that no third object intervenes. 1968 Black's 62 (comparing adjacent with adjoining), see ibid. (Adjoining means touching or contiguous, as distinguished from lying near to or adjacent), see also Black's Law Dictionary 38-39 (5th ed. 1979) (same), Webster's Third 26-27 (similar). As applied to wetlands, a marsh is adjacent to a river even if separated by a levee, just as your neighbor's house is adjacent to your house even if separated by a fence or an alley.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,194,"In other contexts, this Court has recognized the important difference in the meaning of the terms adjacent and adjoining and has held that adjacent is broader than adjoining or actually contiguous. United States v. St. Anthony R. Co., 192 U.S. 524, 533, 24 S.Ct. 333, 48 L.Ed. 548 (1904). As an example, the St. Anthony case concerned a federal statute granting railroads the right to cut timber from public lands adjacent to a railroad right of way. Id., at 526, n. 1, 530, 24 S.Ct. 333. The Court held that timber could be taken from adjacent sections of land that were not contiguous to or actually touching the right of way. Id., at 538, 24 S.Ct. 333.

Some of those administrations promulgated very broad  interpretations of adjacent wetlands. Others adopted far narrower interpretations. Yet all of those eight different administrations have recognized as a matter of law that the Clean Water Act's coverage of adjacent wetlands means more than adjoining wetlands and also includes wetlands separated from covered waters by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, or the like. That consistency in interpretation is strong confirmation of the ordinary meaning of adjacent wetlands.",Kavanaugh,0,

But instead of adhering to the ordinary meaning of adjacent wetlands, to the 45 years of consistent agency practice, and to this Court's precedents, the Court today adopts a test under which a wetland is covered only if the wetland has a continuous surface connection to a covered water—in other words, if it adjoins a covered water.

2022-001,212,"Recall again how the 1977 Act came about. In 1975, the Army Corps concluded that the 1972 Act's coverage of waters of the United States included adjacent wetlands. 40 Fed. Reg. 31324. Then in 1977, Congress adopted a new permitting program for a category of waters of the  United States. Congress allocated to the Federal Government exclusive authority to issue Clean Water Act permits for dumping dredged or fill material into certain waters of the United States, including wetlands adjacent thereto. 91 Stat. 1601. Through that statutory text, Congress made clear its understanding that waters of the United States included adjacent wetlands—and indeed, Congress designed important federal-state permitting authorities around that precise understanding. Congress's 1977 amendment did not merely express an opinion about the meaning of the Clean Water Act, rather, it reflected what Congress understood its own prior acts to mean. Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773, 785, n. 12, 103 S.Ct. 2187, 76 L.Ed.2d 312 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,213,"Moreover, Congress's 1977 decision was no accident. As this Court has previously recognized, the scope of the Corps' asserted jurisdiction over wetlands—including the Corps' decision to cover adjacent wetlands—was specifically brought to Congress' attention in 1977, and Congress rejected measures designed to curb the Corps' jurisdiction. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 137, 106 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). Subsequently, this Court has recognized that Congress's 1977 amendment made clear that the Act covers wetlands adjacent to navigable waters. Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 167, 121 S.Ct. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001), see Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 138, 106 S.Ct. 455 (Congress expressly stated that the term `waters' included adjacent wetlands).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,214,"Not surprisingly, in the years since 1977, no one has seriously disputed that the Act covers adjacent wetlands. And in light of the text of the Act, eight consecutive Presidential administrations have recognized that the Act covers adjacent wetlands and that adjacent wetlands include more than simply adjoining wetlands. The Court's analysis today therefore seems stuck in a bit of a time warp—relitigating an issue that Congress settled in 1977 and that this Court has long treated as settled: The Act covers adjacent wetlands. By adopting a test that substitutes adjoining for adjacent, the Court today errs.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,215,"The Court also invokes federalism and vagueness concerns. The Court suggests that ambiguities or vagueness in federal statutes regulating private property should be construed in favor of the property owner, particularly given that States have traditionally regulated private property rights. See ante, at 1341-1343, see also Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty., 531 U.S., at 173-174, 121 S.Ct. 675. To begin with, the Federal Government has long regulated the waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,216,"In any event, the decisive point here is that the term adjacent in this statute is unambiguously broader than the term adjoining.

And we may not rewrite adjacent to mean the same thing as adjoining, as the Court does today.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,217,"Finally, contrary to the Court's suggestion otherwise, the analysis in this separate opinion centers on the operative text, waters of the United States. Ante, at 1344. To recap: The 1972 Act covered waters of the United States. In 1977, when Congress allocated permitting authority, Congress expressly included adjacent wetlands within the waters of the United States. Since then, the Executive Branch and this Court have recognized that waters of the United States covers adjacent wetlands. Based on the text of the statute, as well as 45 years of consistent  agency practice and this Court's precedents, I respectfully disagree with the Court's decision to interpret waters of the United States to include only adjoining wetlands and not adjacent wetlands.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,219,"The difference between adjacent and adjoining in this context is not merely semantic or academic. The Court's rewriting of adjacent to mean adjoining will matter a great deal in the real world. In particular, the Court's new and overly narrow test may leave long-regulated and long-accepted-to-be-regulable wetlands suddenly beyond the scope of the agencies' regulatory authority, with negative consequences for waters of the United States. For example, the Mississippi River features an extensive levee system to prevent flooding. Under the Court's continuous surface connection test, the presence of those levees (the equivalent of a dike) would seemingly preclude Clean Water Act coverage of adjacent wetlands on the other side of the levees, even though the adjacent wetlands are often an important part of the flood-control project. See Brief for Respondents 30. Likewise, federal protection of the Chesapeake Bay might be less effective if fill can be dumped into wetlands that are adjacent to (but not adjoining) the bay and its covered tributaries. See id., at 35. Those are just two of many examples of how the Court's overly narrow view of the Clean Water Act will have concrete impact.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,220,"As those examples reveal, there is a good reason why Congress covered not only adjoining wetlands but also adjacent wetlands. Because of the movement of water between adjacent wetlands and other waters, pollutants in wetlands often end up in adjacent rivers, lakes, and other waters. Natural barriers such as berms and dunes do not block all water flow and are in fact evidence of a regular connection between a water and a wetland. 85 Fed. Reg. 22307, 88 Fed. Reg. 3095, 3118. Similarly, artificial barriers such as dikes and levees typically do not block all water flow, 85 Fed. Reg. 22312, 88 Fed. Reg. 3076, and those artificial structures were often built to control the surface water connection between the wetland and the water. 85 Fed. Reg. 22315, 88 Fed. Reg. 3118. The scientific evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that wetlands separated from covered waters by those kinds of berms or barriers, for example, still play an important role in protecting neighboring and downstream waters, including by filtering pollutants, storing water, and providing flood control. See 88 Fed. Reg. 3118, 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(b)(2) (2022), see also United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121, 134, 106 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). In short, those adjacent wetlands may affect downstream water quality and flood control in many of the same ways that adjoining wetlands can.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,221,"The Court's erroneous test not only will create real-world consequences for the waters of the United States, but also is sufficiently novel and vague (at least as a single standalone test) that it may create regulatory uncertainty for the Federal Government, the States, and regulated parties. As the Federal Government suggests, the continuous surface connection test raises a host of thorny questions and will lead to potentially arbitrary results. Brief for Respondents 29. For example, how difficult does it have to be to discern the boundary between a water and a wetland for the wetland to be covered by the Clean Water Act? How does that test apply to the many kinds of wetlands that typically do not have a surface water connection to a covered water year-round—for example, wetlands and waters that are connected for much of the year but not in the summer when they dry up to some extent?  How temporary do interruptions in surface connection have to be for wetlands to still be covered? Ante, at 1340-1341. How does the test operate in areas where storms, floods, and erosion frequently shift or breach natural river berms? Can a continuous surface connection be established by a ditch, swale, pipe, or culvert? See 88 Fed. Reg. 3095. The Court covers wetlands separated from a water by an artificial barrier constructed illegally, see ante, at 1341, n. 16, but why not also include barriers authorized by the Army Corps at a time when it would not have known that the barrier would cut off federal authority? The list goes on.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,222,"Put simply, the Court's atextual test— rewriting adjacent to mean adjoining— will produce real-world consequences for the waters of the United States and will generate regulatory uncertainty. I would stick to the text. There can be no debate, in my respectful view, that the key statutory term is adjacent and that adjacent wetlands is a broader category than adjoining wetlands. To be faithful to the statutory text, we cannot interpret adjacent wetlands to be the same thing as adjoining wetlands.* * *",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-001,223,"In sum, I agree with the Court's decision not to adopt the significant nexus test for adjacent wetlands. I respectfully disagree, however, with the Court's new continuous surface connection test. In my view, the Court's new test is overly narrow and inconsistent with the Act's coverage of adjacent wetlands. The Act covers adjacent wetlands, and a wetland is adjacent to a covered water (i) if the wetland is contiguous to or bordering a covered water, or (ii) if the wetland is separated from a covered water only by a man-made dike or barrier, natural river berm, beach dune, or the like. The wetlands on the Sacketts' property do not fall into either of those categories and therefore are not covered under the Act as I would interpret it. Therefore, like the Court, I would reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.

At the time, if an individual wanted to safely send money to another person, she could go to a Western Union office and purchase a money order. Ibid. Such a purchaser would give Western Union the value of the money order plus a fee. Ibid. Then, Western Union would send a telegraph message to the company office closest to the intended recipient (or intended payee). Ibid.

2022-002,39,"These rules were designed, at least in part, to distribute escheats equitably. We selected escheatment to the State of the creditor's last known address as the default principle because it tended to distribute escheats among the States in the proportion of the commercial activities of their residents. Id., at 681, 85 S.Ct. 626. By contrast, escheatment to the State of incorporation of the debtor (our secondary rule) would too greatly exhalt a minor factor—i.e., where the debtor chose to incorporate—when the underlying obligations were incurred all over the country.

While we recognized that Pennsylvania's proposed escheatment rule had some surface appeal, we declined to modify the primary and secondary rules established in Texas, noting that States could solve the problem of inequitable escheatment by requiring Western Union to keep sufficient records. 407 U.S. at 214-215, 92 S.Ct. 2075.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,43,"Congress passed the FDA two years after our decision in Pennsylvania to abrogate this Court's common-law escheatment practices and adopt a more equitable rule, at least for some products. 12 U.S.C. § 2501, Delaware v. New York, 507 U.S. 490, 510, 113 S.Ct. 1550, 123 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993), S. Rep. No. 93-505, pp. 1-3 (1973).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,44,"In the text of the statute, Congress declared that, as a matter of equity among the several States, the States wherein the purchasers of money orders and traveler's checks reside should  be entitled to the proceeds of such instruments in the event of abandonment. § 2501(3). Yet, the statute further recognized that such an equitable distribution was not happening under the common-law rules, to the detriment of interstate commerce, because the books and records of banking and financial organizations and business associations engaged in issuing and selling money orders and traveler's checks do not, as a matter of business practice, show the last known addresses  of purchasers of such instruments. § 2501(1), see § 2501(4).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,45,"Notably, instead of keeping our Texas default rule and mandating recordkeeping requirements for debtors, as we had suggested in Pennsylvania, the FDA addressed the inequitable escheatment problem by establishing a different set of escheatment rules that displaces this Court's primary and secondary escheatment rules whenever applicable. See § 2503. It states that where any sum is payable on a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument (other than a third party bank check) on which a banking or financial organization or a business association is directly liable, the primary escheatment rule is the place-of-purchase rule that Pennsylvania had proposed in the Pennsylvania case. § 2503(1).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,46,"Thus, per the FDA, the proceeds of the listed financial instruments escheat to the State of purchase upon abandonment, so long as purchase-location information is known and that State has enacted laws empowering it to take custody of those proceeds. Ibid.2 The text of the FDA also explains why the inequitable escheatment problem was handled in this fashion rather than by adopting a recordkeeping requirement for debtors holding on to abandoned funds. See § 2501(5) (observing that the cost of maintaining and retrieving addresses of purchasers of money orders and traveler's checks is an additional burden on interstate commerce that is unnecessary since it has been determined that most purchasers reside in the State of purchase of such instruments).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,49,"Although the telegraphic aspect of Western Union's money order business has fallen into disuse, money orders are still sold today for the same purpose: to safely transmit funds to an intended payee.3 Many banks have outsourced the issuance and handling of these kinds of prepaid financial instruments to businesses such as MoneyGram.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,50,"The parties have identified four MoneyGram products as relevant to this litigation. MoneyGram calls these financial instruments Retail Money Orders, Agent Check Money Orders, Agent Checks, and Teller's Checks. All of these instruments are products that MoneyGram creates and markets but that are sold to  customers by another entity (either a retail location or bank) on behalf of MoneyGram.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,51,"As a general matter, these four MoneyGram products operate in the same manner. The purchaser prepays the face value of the instrument, plus any fee, and MoneyGram holds the proceeds (which have been sent to them by the seller entity) until the intended payee presents the instrument for payment. In addition, as a matter of business practice, MoneyGram keeps only limited records about transactions concerning these products. The seller entity transmits information to MoneyGram that identifies where the product was sold, among other things, but the seller does not include in the information given to MoneyGram the identity or address of the purchaser or payee (even if the seller collects that information).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,52,"The heart of the instant dispute relates to how MoneyGram handles the abandoned proceeds of these products. MoneyGram considers two of the four products— Retail Money Orders and Agent Check Money Orders—as falling within the scope of the FDA, so it gives the abandoned proceeds of those particular instruments to the States of purchase in accordance with § 2503. But MoneyGram treats Agent Checks and Teller's Checks (collectively, the Disputed Instruments) as governed by the common law instead of the FDA. Because MoneyGram does not keep records of creditor addresses for these products, MoneyGram applies the secondary rule of Texas and gives the abandoned proceeds of those particular instruments to its State of incorporation, Delaware.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,54,"After an audit of MoneyGram's escheatment policies, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin filed separate lawsuits challenging Delaware's escheatment of the abandoned proceeds of Agent Checks and Teller's Checks. Invoking this Court's original jurisdiction to decide controversies between States, Delaware moved to file a bill of complaint against Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Arkansas, acting on behalf of itself and several other States, filed a separate motion for leave to file a bill of complaint. We consolidated the actions and appointed a Special Master.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,55,"The Special Master bifurcated the proceedings into liability and damages phases. The first phase (to which the current dispute pertains) focuses solely on which State or States have priority to take custody of the proceeds from MoneyGram Agent Checks and Teller's Checks upon abandonment. At the second phase, the Special Master will analyze any damages. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,56,"In July 2021, the Special Master issued a First Interim Report that concluded that the Disputed Instruments were covered by the FDA. Delaware filed exceptions to that report. Then, after we had considered the parties' briefs and held oral argument, the Special Master announced that our proceedings had caused him to reassess his conclusions. He subsequently issued a Second Interim Report that concluded that many of the Disputed Instruments were or could be third party bank checks and would thereby be excluded from the FDA, which means that, when abandoned, they would generally escheat to Delaware under the common law. Both parties submitted exceptions to the Special Master's Second Interim Report.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,58,"The parties are at odds over whether the Disputed Instruments qualify as money orders or other similar written instruments (other than a third party bank check) within the meaning of the FDA,  § 2503—a determination that, for present purposes, establishes whether the FDA or the common law governs their escheatment when abandoned. We conclude that the Disputed Instruments are covered by the FDA because they are other similar written instruments, and neither Delaware nor the Special Master has convinced us that they are third party bank checks. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,60,"Because the plain text of the FDA applies to not only money orders and traveler's checks but also written instruments that are similar to those financial products, ibid., we need not determine whether the Disputed Instruments are money orders, a finding that they are similar to money orders is sufficient to bring them within the reach of the statute (so long as they are not third party bank checks).4 We determine what similar entails in light of the FDA's text and context, Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1783, 1790, 213 L.Ed.2d 27 (2022), not in the abstract. And in these particular cases, the Disputed Instruments share two relevant similarities with money orders. Those instruments operate in the same manner as money orders do (as defined by contemporaneous dictionaries and our prior escheatment cases), and they also implicate the one feature of money orders that the text of the FDA explicitly identifies, insofar as the Disputed Instruments escheat inequitably solely to one State under our common-law rules due to the business practices of the company holding the funds.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,61,"First, the Disputed Instruments are similar to money orders in function and operation. The FDA does not define a money order, so the core features of that instrument are gleaned from a consideration of the `ordinary, contemporary, common meaning' of the term. Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227, 134 S.Ct. 870, 187 L.Ed.2d 729 (2014) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S.Ct. 311, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979)). The parties cite a variety of contemporaneous dictionary definitions and encyclopedia descriptions for the term, and, at the most basic level, a money order is universally defined as a prepaid (or purchased) financial instrument used to transmit money to a named payee.5 Some of the dictionaries further indicate that a money order involves a specified sum of money. Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 547 (1972), see also American Heritage Dictionary 847 (1969) (a specified amount of money).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,62,"These features—i.e., prepayment of a specified amount of money to be transmitted to a named payee—generally accord with how we described the Western Union money orders at issue in our prior escheatment  cases. See Pennsylvania, 407 U.S. at 208, 92 S.Ct. 2075, Western Union Telegraph Co., 368 U.S. at 72, 82 S.Ct. 199. And the FDA was enacted against the backdrop of the common law as set forth in those cases, indeed, it abrogates the common-law escheatment rules that we adopted in those cases. The statute is naturally read to reflect the same basic conception of the term money order that we addressed in those precedents.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,63,"The operation of the FDA further confirms the relevance of the prepayment feature of a money order for the purpose of assessing the similarity of the Disputed Instruments. The FDA plainly regulates the escheatment of abandoned financial products, and when financial instruments are prepaid, the likelihood of their abandonment (and thus the potential for escheatment) increases, as the holder of the proceeds of such instruments has possession of the prepaid sums of money if the instruments are never collected or presented for payment. See Pennsylvania, 407 U.S. at 208, 92 S.Ct. 2075. Thus, the FDA naturally applies to prepaid instruments, such as money orders, given that those instruments are of a type likely to implicate the FDA's escheatment rules. And Delaware does not dispute that, just like money orders, the Disputed Instruments are prepaid written financial instruments used to transmit money to intended payees.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,64,"Second, the Disputed Instruments are similar to the money orders that the FDA targets because they inequitably escheat in the manner that the text of the FDA specifically identifies as warranting statutory intervention. Just as with the money orders in Pennsylvania, the company holding the proceeds of the Disputed Instruments (MoneyGram) does not keep adequate records of creditor addresses as a matter of business practice. And the FDA abrogates this Court's escheatment precedents on this very basis. See §§ 2501, 2503. Consequently, the inherent characteristics of money orders are not the only relevant point of similarity between money orders and the Disputed Instruments, in addition, they both would otherwise escheat inequitably under the secondary common-law rule due to the business practices of the company holding the funds.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,65,"The context in which the FDA arises underscores the meaningfulness of this similarity. Our common-law rules were permitting inequitable escheatment (insofar as our primary rule mistakenly relied on the assumption that the holders of such instruments regularly collected creditors' address information), and the statute that Congress enacted in the wake of our Pennsylvania ruling details the inequitable escheatment problem. Thus, the FDA regulates money orders (however that term is ordinarily defined) not just for the sake of regulating those particular financial instruments, but because inequitable escheatment occurs under our common-law rules if financial instruments do not have address information that can facilitate distribution to the State of entitlement when they are abandoned, and the entities issuing and selling money orders often do not keep adequate records. The lack of related creditor address information was a key feature of the money orders that we evaluated when we were asked to revisit our common-law escheatment rules in Pennsylvania, 407 U.S. at 214, 92 S.Ct. 2075. So it should come as no surprise that it is likewise a key feature of the statute that Congress enacted to displace our common-law rules.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,66,"The inadequate-recordkeeping feature of money orders is also derived from the text of the FDA itself. The statute references both our observation in Texas that, as a matter of equity, the proceeds of abandoned  intangible property should be spread among the several States, § 2501(3), and Pennsylvania's subsequent recognition that the proceeds of such instruments are not being distributed to the States entitled thereto, § 2501(4). The FDA explains that this inequity was occurring because the books and records of banking and financial organizations and business associations engaged in issuing and selling money orders and traveler's checks do not, as a matter of business practice, show the last known addresses of purchasers of such instruments. § 2501(1). The operative provision of the statute (§ 2503) then adopts the precise alternative rule of escheatment that Pennsylvania suggested in the face of inequitable escheatment caused by a company's business practices.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,67,"In short, the FDA's text provides a solution for the problem of the inequitable distribution of escheats, and that solution expressly eschews requiring entities like Western Union to keep adequate records. See §§ 2501(5), 2503. Inadequate recordkeeping is thus highly relevant to the interpretive question of when the FDA, rather than the common law, should apply to the escheatment of the intangible property at issue.6",Jackson,0,
2022-002,68,"It is uncontested that the Disputed Instruments share the inadequate recordkeeping feature of money orders that the FDA identifies. See § 2501(1). Therefore, if the common law were to apply to the Disputed Instruments, then the abandoned proceeds would escheat inequitably solely to the State of incorporation, just like the money orders expressly referenced in the statute.7",Jackson,0,
2022-002,70,Delaware's various arguments as to why the Disputed Instruments should not qualify as other similar written instruments within the meaning of § 2503 are unpersuasive.,Jackson,0,
2022-002,71,"First up in Delaware's attempt to distinguish the Disputed Instruments from money orders for FDA purposes is its contention that the term money order in the FDA refers to a specific commercial product that is labeled money order by the  seller and is generally sold in low values to low-income individuals as a substitute for ordinary personal checks. Delaware does not point to any dictionary that includes those additional attributes in its definition of money order, nor do any of our prior cases that describe Western Union money orders mention such features. See Pennsylvania, 407 U.S. at 208-209, 92 S.Ct. 2075, Western Union Telegraph Co., 368 U.S. at 72-73, 82 S.Ct. 199. Moreover, while Delaware offers two encyclopedia entries that suggest money orders are especially helpful to persons who do not have checking accounts,8 neither source says that the typical or intended user is, itself, an attribute of a money order.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,72,"Delaware also tries to highlight various ways in which the Disputed Instruments can be said to differ from money orders, as Delaware describes them, including differences with respect to face values and customer use. But Delaware never explains why those purported differences are relevant to our assessment of similarity for FDA purposes. Since money orders and the Disputed Instruments are comparators that are not identical, they are likely to be different in some respect. The real question is which differences and similarities matter. And none of the differences Delaware identifies relates to the statutory text or ordinary meaning of a money order, nor do they otherwise undermine the analysis of similarity we outlined above.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,73,"Undaunted, Delaware attempts to make the differences it identifies seem more material by proffering an alternative vision of the FDA. In this regard, Delaware asserts that the FDA was really an effort to dissuade States from adopting costly recordkeeping requirements, the costs of which might then be passed along to low-income consumers. Its argument is that, because the Disputed Instruments are, when compared to money orders, generally larger-value instruments that are typically purchased by consumers who can more easily absorb any additional recordkeeping-related costs, those products simply do not implicate the FDA's core (cost-related) concerns and are thus not similar to money orders.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,74,"But the text of the FDA bears no relationship to Delaware's cost argument. Indeed, the statute says absolutely nothing about the rising costs of money orders for low-income individuals. See § 2501. The cost of maintaining and retrieving addresses of purchasers of money orders and traveler's checks is only mentioned to explain why a mandatory recordkeeping option (which we had suggested in Pennsylvania, 407 U.S. at 215, 92 S.Ct. 2075) was not selected as the statutory solution to the inequitable escheatment problem that the FDA plainly addresses. § 2501(5).",Jackson,0,
2022-002,75,"Nor does it matter that there would be no inequitable escheatment with respect to the Disputed Instruments if MoneyGram did not factor into the equation, as Delaware maintains. In this regard, Delaware argues that the Disputed Instruments do not implicate the concerns underlying the FDA because the banks that sell the Disputed Instruments generally do keep adequate records, and therefore States can avoid the escheatment problem by passing laws requiring those banks to transmit their records to MoneyGram and requiring MoneyGram to keep those records. But the FDA regulates escheatment, so it is the recordkeeping practices of the entity holding the funds that is relevant. Here, that entity is MoneyGram, not the banks. MoneyGram has the recordkeeping practices identified as warranting intervention  through the FDA, see § 2501(1), and the statute contains a solution to the escheatment problem that MoneyGram's ordinary business practices cause, see § 2503.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,76,"Finally, Delaware suggests that § 2503 must be read narrowly in order to avoid both creating surplusage and sweeping in all sorts of financial products that Congress did not intend to cover. This goes too far. Although Delaware argues, with some merit, that broadly defining a money order as a prepaid instrument used to transmit money to a named payee would render the statute's separate references to traveler's checks and other similar written instruments superfluous, we need not define money order in order to conclude that the FDA applies to the Disputed Instruments, since it suffices that the instruments in question be similar to a money order, they need not share its definition. And if other similar written instrument is interpreted with reference to both the inherent qualities of a money order and also the recordkeeping concern that the FDA expressly identifies in the text, as discussed above, then the scope of the statute is properly cabined.9",Jackson,0,
2022-002,78,"Delaware argues that even if the Disputed Instruments qualify as other similar written instruments within the meaning of § 2503 they are also third party bank checks and, as such, are expressly excluded from the FDA.10 The Special Master, too, ultimately adopted a version of this argument, in his view, the third party bank check exemption applies to any Disputed Instrument on which a bank is liable (in addition to MoneyGram).11 Neither Delaware nor the Special Master has provided a persuasive reason for concluding that the Disputed Instruments are third party bank checks within the meaning of the FDA, and the drafting history of the statute further confirms that the sweep of that language is not as broad as the definitions that Delaware and the Special Master have offered. Therefore, as explained below, we do not  accept the contention that the Disputed Instruments are carved out of the statute per the third party bank check language.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,80,"First, however, a caveat: We readily admit that discerning the meaning of third party bank check in § 2503 is tricky, because the FDA does not define that phrase, and, as far as we can tell, it does not have an ordinary, contemporary, common meaning. Sandifer, 571 U.S. at 227, 134 S.Ct. 870. The parties have not pointed to any contemporary legal or financial source that defines that precise term. And the FDA's third party bank check language confounded all three experts retained in these cases, each of whom agreed that it has no traditional meaning in either the legal or the financial realms. Notably, the Special Master valiantly attempted to bring clarity to this term, adopting three different definitions of third party bank check over the course of this litigation. Ultimately, between the parties and the Special Master, we have been offered at least six disparate definitions of the term.13",Jackson,0,
2022-002,81,"In the midst of this uncertainty, Delaware insists that the term third party bank check means a check signed by a bank officer and paid through a third party. Not surprisingly, that definition fits the Disputed Instruments like a glove, given that they are signed by bank employees and then ultimately paid through MoneyGram, a nonbank third party, when presented. But Delaware provides no support whatsoever for the conclusion that this is what third party bank check means in the FDA context. And, indeed, Delaware's own expert disagreed with that definition for FDA purposes. Delaware also has no theory as to why it matters to the escheatment rules that the statute adopts whether a financial instrument is or is not paid through a third party like MoneyGram. Thus, we are hard pressed to agree that third party bank check means what Delaware says.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,82,"The Special Master's analysis fares no better. In his Second Interim Report, the Special Master offered a potential definition of third party bank check that relies on the view that the phrase was intended to exclude from the FDA's reach certain financial instruments that were well known at the time of the statute's enactment but were not expressly mentioned in the statute —specifically, cashier's checks, certified checks, and teller's checks. According to the Special Master, a significant feature of those particular financial instruments at the time of the FDA's enactment was that a bank was liable on those instruments. Therefore, according to the Special Master, insofar as a bank is directly liable on some of the Disputed Instruments (in addition to MoneyGram), any such MoneyGram product is a bank check that should be deemed to fall within the third party bank check exception for purposes of the FDA.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,83,"We detect multiple problems with the Special Master's reasoning. For one, the Special Master did not explain why the statute uses the amorphous phrase third party bank check to capture specific financial instruments that, according to the Special Master, were well known at the time of the enactment of the statute. Congress called out other well-known instruments —money orders and traveler's  checks—by their names in the text of the FDA. One would reasonably expect it to have done the same for cashier's checks, certified checks, and teller's checks.13",Jackson,0,
2022-002,84,"The Special Master also failed to provide an adequate explanation for why bank liability relates in any meaningful way to the escheatment rules that the FDA adopts. That explanation seems crucial because the parties appear to agree that banks can be liable on money orders themselves, and, as previously explained, far from being excluded, money orders are expressly covered items in this statute. This incongruity makes it hard to conceive of the bank-liability attribute as the tipping point for whether a financial instrument qualifies as a third party bank check for FDA purposes. Similarly, if we were to agree with the Special Master that bank liability is dispositive of a third party bank check designation, then presumably any draft on which a bank is liable would fall outside of the FDA—a result that reads the term third party out of the statute.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,85,"The Special Master's reasoning further fails to account for the nature of the Disputed Instruments, which do not appear to qualify as bank checks, at least not in the traditional sense of that word. According to the parties, a bank check is a check drawn on a bank's own account or by a bank and on a bank (either the same bank or another).14 That does not describe the Disputed Instruments, which are drawn on MoneyGram's account, not a bank's account.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,86,"Consequently, nothing in the reasoning provided by Delaware or the Special Master persuades us that the Disputed Instruments, which are otherwise similar to money orders for FDA purposes, should be deemed third party bank checks within the meaning of § 2503.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,88,"Nor does the legislative history support Delaware's contention that the Disputed Instruments constitute third party bank checks. Those of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text. Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 572, 131 S.Ct. 1259, 179 L.Ed.2d 268 (2011). In the instant situation, while the meaning of the phrase third party bank check is subject to myriad alternative definitions and is generally unknown, the phrase was inserted into § 2503 under well-documented circumstances. And those circumstances further support the conclusion that, whatever third party bank check is meant to mean, the Disputed Instruments are not exempted from the FDA under that provision, as Delaware maintains.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,89,"Specifically, during the time in which Congress was mulling a draft of the FDA's provisions, it solicited the views of the Treasury Department, and the agency's general counsel responded. He wrote a letter stating that, although he did not object to the adoption of the bill's escheatment rules, he believed the language of the bill was broader than intended by the drafters. S. Rep. No. 93-505, at 5 (Letter from Edward C. Schmults). According to  the letter, agency counsel was concerned, in particular, that the phrase `money order, traveler's check, or similar written instrument on which a bank or financial organization or business association is directly liable' could be interpreted to cover `third party payment bank checks.' Ibid. Thus, he recommended excluding third party payment bank checks from the FDA, ibid., and Congress subsequently adopted this recommendation, dropping the suggested word payment in the process, id., at 6, see also § 2503.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,90,"Reliable sources indicate that the third party bank check language was not supposed to be a significant addition. The Senate Report described it as a mere technical alteration. Id., at 6, see also 120 Cong. Rec. 4528 (1974) (statement of Com. Chairman Sen. Sparkman referring to the insertion of the language as a minor change). Thus, that statutory phrase is reasonably viewed as merely clarifying the intended initial scope of coverage (i.e., as an effort to better demarcate the boundaries of a statute that regulates escheatment of money orders, traveler's checks, and other similar written instruments, § 2503), rather than as an express exemption that accepts that items of this nature would otherwise qualify for regulation under the terms of the statute and specifically undertakes to carve them out.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,91,"In any event, given the history and text of the FDA, it would be strange to interpret the third party bank check language to exempt from the statute entire swaths of prepaid financial instruments that are otherwise similar to money orders in that they operate in generally the same fashion and would likewise escheat inequitably pursuant to the common law due to the business practices of the company holding the funds. At the very least, reading the exemption that broadly would imbue third party bank check with a meaning that far surpasses a technical change. And it would also risk rendering largely ineffectual the FDA's framework for displacement of the common law, as necessary, to ensure equitable escheatment.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-002,92,"When a financial product operates like a money order—i.e., when it is a prepaid written instrument used to transmit money to a named payee—and when it would also escheat inequitably solely to the State of incorporation of the company holding the funds under our common-law rules due to recordkeeping gaps, then it is sufficiently similar to a money order to fall presumptively within the FDA. Such is the case with the Disputed Instruments. And nothing in the parties' arguments, the Special Master's Second Interim Report, or the record in these cases persuades us that the Disputed Instruments should be deemed third party bank checks.",Jackson,0,
2022-002,93,"Accordingly, we adopt the Special Master's recommendations in the First Interim Report, along with his initial proposed order, to the extent they are consistent with this opinion.15 We also overrule Delaware's exceptions to the First Interim Report and remand this matter to the Special Master for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.16",Jackson,0,

2022-003,25,"This case concerns the effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran of the United States military. The governing statute provides that the effective date of the award shall not be earlier than the day on which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) receives the veteran's application for benefits. But the statute specifies 16 exceptions, one of which is relevant here: If the VA receives the application within a year of the veteran's discharge, the effective date is the day after the veteran's discharge. We must decide whether this exception is subject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that would allow some applications filed outside the 1-year period to qualify for the day after discharge effective date. We hold that the provision cannot be equitably tolled.",Barrett,0,

A regional office of the VA then determines whether the veteran satisfies all legal prerequisites, including the requirement that military service caused or aggravated the disability. George v.

2022-003,33,"Arellano appealed the regional office's decision to the VA's Board of Veterans' Appeals. He acknowledged that he did not submit an application for benefits until June 2011. But he argued that the regional office should have equitably tolled § 5110(b)(1)'s 1-year timeline to make his award effective as of the day after his discharge from service in 1981 or, at the latest, January 1, 1982. In support of equitable tolling, Arellano alleged that he had been too ill to know that he could apply for service-connected disability benefits. The Board denied Arellano's request for equitable tolling, and the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed.",Barrett,0,

2022-003,39,"The Secretary of Veterans Affairs advances two reasons why § 5110(b)(1) is not subject to equitable tolling. The first would head tolling off at the pass: He argues that § 5110(b)(1) is not a statute of limitations, so the presumption is wholly inapplicable. See Lozano, 572 U.S. at 13-14, 134 S.Ct. 1224 (We have only applied Irwin's presumption to statutes of limitations). Rather than extinguishing a tardy claim (the function of a statute of limitations), § 5110(b)(1) caps the award for a successful claim (a different function). Brief for Respondent 18-22. That it does so with reference to the time of filing, the Secretary says, does not convert it into a statute of limitations. Id., at 21, 134 S.Ct. 1224. In any event, the Secretary adds, equitable tolling is at odds with the statutory text and structure—so even assuming that § 5110(b)(1) sets a limitations period, the presumption is rebutted.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,40,"We need not address the Secretary's first argument because the second is straightforward. The presumption is rebutted if there is good reason to believe that Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply. United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347, 350, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997). In this case, there is very good reason to draw that conclusion. Section 5110 contains detailed instructions for when a veteran's claim for benefits may enjoy an effective date earlier than the one provided by the default rule. It would be inconsistent with this comprehensive scheme for an adjudicator to extend effective dates still further through the doctrine of equitable tolling.1",Barrett,0,
2022-003,42,"Start with the text. Section 5110(b)(1) operates as a limited exception to § 5110(a)(1)'s default rule, which states that the effective date of an award  shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. The default applies unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter—a clause indicating that Congress enumerated an exhaustive list of exceptions, with each confined to its specific terms. § 5110(a)(1). According to the terms of the exception in § 5110(b)(1), the effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the day following the date of the veteran's discharge or release if application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. Equitably tolling this provision would depart from the terms that Congress specifically provided. § 5110(a)(1).",Barrett,0,
2022-003,43,"The structure of § 5110 reinforces Congress's choice to set effective dates solely as prescribed in the text. The statute sets  out detailed instructions that explain when various types of benefits qualify for an effective date earlier than the default. There are 16 such exceptions—and equitable tolling is not on the list. See §§ 5110(b)(1), (b)(2)(A), (b)(3), (b)(4)(A), (c), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (n). Notably, these exceptions do not operate simply as time constraints, but also as substantive limitations on the amount of recovery due. See, e.g., § 5110(g) (In no event shall an award or increase under this paragraph be retroactive for more than one year from the date of application therefor or the date of administrative determination of entitlement, whichever is earlier). We stated in Brockamp that an explicit listing of exceptions in a statute containing detail and describing not only procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of recovery strongly indicated that Congress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned, open-ended, `equitable' exceptions into the statute that it wrote. 519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. So too here. If Congress wanted the VA to adjust a claimant's entitlement to retroactive benefits based on unmentioned equitable factors, it is difficult to see why it spelled out a long list of situations in which a claimant is entitled to adjustment—and instructed the VA to stick to the exceptions specifically provided. § 5110(a)(1).",Barrett,0,
2022-003,44,"That many of the specific exceptions reflect equitable considerations heightens the structural inference. Several, including § 5110(b)(1), apply when the event triggering the entitlement to benefits is disability or death—both circumstances in which prompt filing could be challenging for a veteran or her survivors. See §§ 5110(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4)(A), (d), cf. Lozano, 572 U.S. at 10, 134 S.Ct. 1224 (noting that equitable tolling may be appropriate when a person diligently pursues her rights but an extraordinary circumstance prevents her from bringing a timely action). One permits an earlier effective date for the award of benefits to a veteran's child, a claimant typically dependent on others for prompt filing. § 5110(e)(1). Still others permit retroactive benefits when facts change or new evidence emerges. See § 5110(h) (permitting retroactive benefits when actual income would increase a pension that had been awarded based on anticipated income), § 5110(i) (permitting retroactive benefits when any disallowed claim is readjudicated and thereafter allowed on the basis of new and relevant evidence resulting from the correction of certain military records). Yet despite its attention to fairness, Congress did not throw the door wide open in these circumstances or any other. In all but one instance, Congress capped retroactive benefits at roughly one year.2  This pattern matters. That Congress accounted for equitable factors in setting effective dates strongly suggests that it did not expect an adjudicator to add a broader range of equitable factors to the mix. And its decision to consistently cap retroactive benefits strongly suggests that it did not expect open-ended tolling to dramatically increase the size of an award. When Congress has already considered equitable concerns and limited the relief available, additional equitable tolling would be unwarranted. Beggerly, 524 U.S. at 48-49, 118 S.Ct. 1862.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,45,"Section 5110(b)(4), another disability-related exception to the default rule, illustrates the point. Recall that § 5110(b)(1), the exception at issue here, adjusts the effective date of disability compensation to the day after a veteran's discharge from the military, so long as the VA receives the claim within one year of discharge. Arellano contends that his claim, filed 30 years after discharge, should relate back to the date of discharge because his disability prevented him from filing earlier than he did. But § 5110(b)(4), which applies to disability pensions rather than disability compensation, expressly accounts for this very concern: It makes pension benefits retroactive to the date of permanent and total disability if the disability prevented the veteran from applying for an award at the time of onset. §§ 5110(b)(4)(A), (B). The possibility that disability could cause delay was therefore on Congress's radar, still, Congress did not explicitly account for it in § 5110(b)(1). Moreover, while Arellano posits an open-ended grace period for § 5110(b)(1), § 5110(b)(4)(A) imposes a restrictive one: It applies only if the veteran applies for a retroactive award within one year of the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled. Why would Congress allow an unlimited grace period for an equitable concern unmentioned in § 5110(b)(1) when it established a limited grace period for the same concern explicitly mentioned in § 5110(b)(4)? Tolling § 5110(b)(1) would single it out for special treatment, enforcing its terms keeps it consistent with the statutory scheme.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,46,"The most compelling argument for equitable tolling is that hard and fast limits on retroactive benefits can create harsh results. The statutory default ties the start of benefits to the application-receipt date, a choice that incentivizes promptness and disfavors retroactive awards. The exceptions granting a 1-year grace period soften that choice in specified circumstances, yet there are situations in which equity's flexible, open-ended approach would be more generous to a deserving claimant. With this in mind, Congress could have designed a scheme that allowed adjudicators to maximize fairness in every case. But Congress has the power to choose between rules, which prioritize efficiency and predictability, and standards, which prioritize optimal results in individual cases. Cf. Brockamp, 519 U.S. at 352-353, 117 S.Ct. 849 (observing that Congress decided to pay the price of occasional unfairness in individual cases  in order to maintain a more workable tax enforcement system). Congress opted for rules in this statutory scheme, and an equitable extension of § 5110(b)(1)'s 1-year grace period would disrupt that choice.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,48,"Arellano contests all of this. Laser focused on § 5110(b)(1), he argues that the provision's unadorned text contains none of the specific, technical language that might otherwise rebut the presumption of equitable tolling. In addition, he emphasizes that there are zero express exceptions to § 5110(b)(1)'s one-year clock, which he describes as fatal to the Secretary's position. Reply Brief 14. As Arellano  sees it, § 5110(b)(1) is a simple time limit and therefore a classic case for equitable tolling.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,49,"If § 5110(b)(1) stood alone, there might be something to Arellano's argument. (Again, assuming that § 5110(b)(1) is a limitations period to which the Irwin presumption applies.) But § 5110(b)(1) cannot be understood independently of § 5110(a)(1), which makes the date of receipt the effective date unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter. Arellano insists that the Secretary overreads unless by treating it as a signal that the enacted exceptions are exclusive. Brief for Petitioner 31-32. But the clause says more than unless—it says that the default applies unless specifically provided otherwise. § 5110(a)(1) (emphasis added). That is an instruction to attend to specifically enacted language to the exclusion of general, unenacted carveouts. While Arellano claims to seek an equitable exception to a general rule, he actually seeks an equitable exception to an exception to a general rule. Structurally, that is a heavy lift. Moreover, § 5110(b)(1) is nestled within a list of 15 other exceptions to § 5110(a)(1)'s default rule, and, as we have already explained, the presence of this detailed, lengthy list raises the inference that the enumerated exceptions are exclusive.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,50,"Arellano also resists the proposition that the express accounting for disability-caused delay in § 5110(b)(4) hurts his case. On the contrary, he insists that it works in his favor. Citing Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 122 S.Ct. 1036, 152 L.Ed.2d 79 (2002), he maintains that an express tolling provision does not displace the presumption of tolling but rather demonstrates that a statute incorporates traditional equitable principles. Brief for Petitioner 37-38. According to Arellano, Congress's silence in § 5110(b)(1) merely shows that it wanted those traditional principles to apply at full strength. Ibid., Reply Brief 19-20.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,51,"We disagree. Section 5110(b)(4) does not help Arellano, for the reasons we have already explained, it illustrates why equitably tolling § 5110(b)(1) is incongruent with the statutory scheme. Young is inapposite. There, we concluded that an express tolling provision for a time limit in a bankruptcy statute supported equitable tolling of a different time limit in the same statute. 535 U.S. at 53, 122 S.Ct. 1036. But that was largely because the express tolling provision authorized tolling where equity would not otherwise have permitted it. Ibid. As a result, we interpreted the express tolling provision to supplement rather than displace principles of equitable tolling. Ibid. (emphasis deleted). Here, however, § 5110(b)(4) does not authorize tolling that equity would not otherwise have allowed. If anything, its conditional and narrow applicability limits tolling that might otherwise have occurred. Though Arellano makes a valiant effort to turn a negative into a positive, § 5110(b)(4) remains an obstacle to his interpretation.",Barrett,0,
2022-003,52,"Finally, Arellano contends that the `nature of the underlying subject matter'— veterans' benefits—counsels in favor of tolling here. Brief for Petitioner 33-34. To support this proposition, he invokes Brockamp, which considered whether courts can equitably toll time limits for filing taxrefund claims. 519 U.S. at 348, 117 S.Ct. 849. After holding that the statute's text and structure rebutted the Irwin presumption, we observed that the nature of the underlying subject matter—tax collection—underscored the linguistic point. Brockamp, 519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. Tax law, after all, is not normally characterized by case-specific exceptions reflecting individualized equities. Ibid. By contrast, Arellano argues, providing benefits to veterans is a context in which individualized  equities are paramount. See King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U.S. 215, 220, n. 9, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (Provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries' favor).",Barrett,0,
2022-003,53,"If the text and structure favored Arellano, the nature of the subject matter would garnish an already solid argument. But the nature of the subject matter cannot overcome text and structure that foreclose equitable tolling. Brockamp turned to the nature of the underlying subject matter only to underscore the linguistic point. 519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. Arellano, however, lacks the linguistic point. This is not a case in which competing interpretations are equally plausible, it is one in which Congress's choice is evident.3* * *",Barrett,0,

And the Washington Post described Mobile as a major defeat for blacks and other minorities fighting electoral schemes that exclude them from office. Washington Post, Apr. 23, 1980, p. A5. By focusing on discriminatory intent and ignoring disparate effect, critics argued, the Court had abrogated the standard used by the courts to determine whether racial discrimination existed : Whether such discrimination existed.

2022-004,56,"But Mobile had its defenders, too. In their view, abandoning the intent test in favor of an effects test would inevitably require a focus on proportionality—wherever a minority group won fewer seats in the legislature than its share of the population, the charge could be made that the State law had a discriminatory effect. That, after all, was the type of claim brought in Mobile. But mandating racial proportionality in elections was regarded by many as intolerable. Doing so, wrote Senator Orrin Hatch in the Washington Star, would be strongly resented by the American public. Washington Star, Sept. 30, 1980, p. A-9.

Hinaman worked to adjust the 2011 map in accordance with the redistricting guidelines set by the legislature's Reapportionment Committee. Id., at 948-950, 1 App. 275. Those guidelines prioritized population equality, contiguity, compactness, and avoiding dilution of minority voting strength. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1035-1036.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,69,"They also encouraged, as a secondary matter, avoiding incumbent pairings, respecting communities of interest, minimizing the number of counties in each district, and preserving cores of existing districts. Id., at 1036-1037.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,70,"The resulting map Hinaman drew largely resembled the 2011 map, again producing only one district in which black voters constituted a majority of the voting age population. Supp. App. 205-211. The Alabama Legislature enacted Hinaman's map under the name HB1. 582 F.Supp.3d at 935, 950-951. Governor Ivey signed HB1 into law on November 4, 2021. Id., at 950.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,72,"Three groups of plaintiffs brought suit seeking to stop Alabama's Secretary of State from conducting congressional elections under HB1. The first group was led by Dr. Marcus Caster, a resident of Washington County, who challenged HB1 as invalid under §2. Id., at 934-935, 980. The second group, led by Montgomery County resident Evan Milligan, brought claims under §2 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 939-940, 966. Finally, the Singleton plaintiffs, who had previously sued to enjoin Alabama's 2011 congressional map, amended their complaint to challenge HB1 as an impermissible racial gerrymander under the Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 938-939.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,73,"A three-judge District Court was convened, comprised of Circuit Judge Marcus and District Judges Manasco and Moorer. The Singleton and Milligan actions were consolidated before the three-judge Court for purposes of preliminary injunction proceedings, while Caster proceeded before Judge Manasco on a parallel track. 582 F.Supp.3d at 934-935. A preliminary injunction hearing began on January 4, 2022, and concluded on January 12. Id., at 943. In that time, the three-judge District Court received live testimony from 17 witnesses, reviewed more than 1000 pages of briefing and upwards of 350 exhibits, and considered arguments from the 43 different lawyers who had appeared in the litigation. Id., at 935-936. After reviewing that extensive record, the Court concluded in a 227-page opinion that the question whether HB1 likely violated § 2 was not a close one. It did. Id., at 1026. The Court thus preliminarily enjoined Alabama from using HB1 in forthcoming elections. Id., at 936.2",Roberts,0,
2022-004,74,"Four days later, on January 28, Alabama moved in this Court for a stay of the District Court's injunction. This Court granted a stay and scheduled the cases for argument, noting probable jurisdiction in Milligan and granting certiorari before judgment in Caster. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 879, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,76,The District Court found that plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that HB1 violates § 2. We affirm that determination.,Roberts,0,
2022-004,78,"For the past forty years, we have evaluated claims brought under § 2 using the three-part framework developed in our decision  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986). Gingles concerned a challenge to North Carolina's multimember districting scheme, which allegedly diluted the vote of its black citizens. Id., at 34-36, 106 S.Ct. 2752. The case presented the first opportunity since the 1982 amendments to address how the new § 2 would operate.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,79,"Gingles began by describing what § 2 guards against. The essence of a § 2 claim, the Court explained, is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters. Id., at 47, 106 S.Ct. 2752. That occurs where an electoral structure operates to minimize or cancel out minority voters' ability to elect their preferred candidates. Id., at 48, 106 S.Ct. 2752. Such a risk is greatest where minority and majority voters consistently prefer different candidates and where minority voters are submerged in a majority voting population that regularly defeats their choices. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,80,"To succeed in proving a § 2 violation under Gingles, plaintiffs must satisfy three preconditions. Id., at 50, 106 S.Ct. 2752. First, the minority group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured district. Wisconsin Legislature v. Wisconsin Elections Comm'n, 595 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1245, 1248, 212 L.Ed.2d 251 (2022) (per curiam) (citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752). A district will be reasonably configured, our cases explain, if it comports with traditional districting criteria, such as being contiguous and reasonably compact. See Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S. 254, 272, 135 S.Ct. 1257, 191 L.Ed.2d 314 (2015). Second, the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. 2752. And third, the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it  to defeat the minority's preferred candidate. Ibid. Finally, a plaintiff who demonstrates the three preconditions must also show, under the totality of circumstances, that the political process is not equally open to minority voters. Id., at 45-46, 106 S.Ct. 2752, see also id., at 36-38, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (identifying several factors relevant to the totality of circumstances inquiry, including the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state  that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,81,"Each Gingles precondition serves a different purpose. The first, focused on geographical compactness and numerosity, is needed to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice in some single-member district. Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993). The second, concerning the political cohesiveness of the minority group, shows that a representative of its choice would in fact be elected. See ibid. The third precondition, focused on racially polarized voting, establishes that the challenged districting thwarts a distinctive minority vote at least plausibly on account of race. Ibid. And finally, the totality of circumstances inquiry recognizes that application of the Gingles factors is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case. 478 U.S. at 79, 106 S.Ct. 2752. Before courts can find a violation of § 2, therefore, they must conduct an intensely local appraisal of the electoral mechanism at issue, as well as a searching practical evaluation of the `past and present reality.' Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,82,"Gingles has governed our Voting Rights Act jurisprudence since it was decided 37 years ago. Congress has never disturbed our understanding of § 2 as Gingles construed it. And we have applied Gingles in one § 2 case after another, to different kinds of electoral systems and to different jurisdictions in States all over the country. See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993) (Ohio), Growe, 507 U.S. at 25, 113 S.Ct. 1075 (Minnesota), Johnson v.

2022-004,84,"As noted, the District Court concluded that plaintiffs' § 2 claim was likely to succeed under Gingles. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1026. Based on our review of the record, we agree.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,85,"With respect to the first Gingles precondition, the District Court correctly found that black voters could constitute a majority in a second district that was reasonably configured. 1 App. to Emergency Application for Stay in No. 21-1086 etc., p. 253 (MSA). The plaintiffs adduced eleven illustrative maps—that is, example districting maps that Alabama could enact— each of which contained two majority-black districts that comported with traditional districting criteria. With respect to compactness, for example, the District Court explained that the maps submitted by one of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Moon Duchin, performed generally better on average than did HB1. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1009. A map offered by another of plaintiffs' experts, Bill Cooper, produced districts roughly as compact as the existing plan. Ibid. And none of plaintiffs' maps contained any tentacles, appendages, bizarre shapes, or any other obvious irregularities that would make it difficult to find them sufficiently compact. Id., at 1011. Plaintiffs' maps also satisfied other traditional districting criteria. They contained equal populations, were contiguous, and respected existing political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, and towns. Id., at 1011, 1016. Indeed, some of plaintiffs' proposed maps split the same number of county lines as (or even fewer county lines than) the State's map. Id., at 1011-1012. We agree with the District Court, therefore, that plaintiffs' illustrative maps strongly suggested that Black voters in Alabama could constitute a majority in a second, reasonably configured, district. Id., at 1010.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,86,"The State nevertheless argues that plaintiffs' maps were not reasonably configured because they failed to keep together a traditional community of interest within Alabama. See, e.g., id., at 1012. A community of interest, according to Alabama's districting guidelines, is an area with recognized similarities of interests, including but not limited to ethnic, racial, economic, tribal, social, geographic, or historical identities. Ibid. Alabama argues that the Gulf Coast region in the southwest of the State is such a community of interest, and that plaintiffs' maps erred by separating it into two different districts. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,87,"We do not find the State's argument persuasive. Only two witnesses testified that the Gulf Coast was a community of interest. Id., at 1015. The testimony provided by one of those witnesses was partial, selectively informed, and poorly supported. Ibid. The other witness, meanwhile, justified keeping the Gulf Coast together simply to preserve political advantage: You start splitting counties, he testified, and that county loses its influence. That's why I don't want Mobile County to be split. Id., at 990, 1015. The District Court understandably found this testimony insufficient to sustain Alabama's overdrawn argument that there can be no legitimate reason to split the Gulf Coast region. Id., at 1015.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,88,"Even if the Gulf Coast did constitute a community of interest, moreover, the District Court found that plaintiffs' maps would still be reasonably configured because they joined together a different community of interest called the Black Belt. Id., at 1012-1014. Named for its fertile soil, the Black Belt contains a high proportion of black voters, who share a rural geography, concentrated poverty, unequal access to government services,  lack of adequate healthcare, and a lineal connection to the many enslaved people brought there to work in the antebellum period. Id., at 1012-1013, see also 1 App. 299-304. The District Court concluded—correctly, under our precedent—that it did not have to conduct a beauty contest between plaintiffs' maps and the State's. There would be a split community of interest in both. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1012 (quoting Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 977-978, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 135 L.Ed.2d 248 (1996) (plurality opinion)).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,89,"The State also makes a related argument based on core retention—a term that refers to the proportion of districts that remain when a State transitions from one districting plan to another. See, e.g., Brief for Alabama 25, 61. Here, by largely mirroring Alabama's 2011 districting plan, HB1 performs well on the core retention metric. Plaintiffs' illustrative plans, by contrast, naturally fare worse because they change where the 2011 district lines were drawn. See e.g., Supp. App. 164-173. But this Court has never held that a State's adherence to a previously used districting plan can defeat a § 2 claim. If that were the rule, a State could immunize from challenge a new racially discriminatory redistricting plan simply by claiming that it resembled an old racially discriminatory plan. That is not the law: § 2 does not permit a State to provide some voters less opportunity  to participate in the political process just because the State has done it before. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,90,"As to the second and third Gingles preconditions, the District Court determined that there was no serious dispute that Black voters are politically cohesive, nor that the challenged districts' white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat Black voters' preferred candidate. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1016 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court noted that, on average, Black voters supported their candidates of choice with 92.3% of the vote while white voters supported Black-preferred candidates with 15.4% of the vote. Id., at 1017 (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs' experts described the evidence of racially polarized voting in Alabama as intense, very strong, and very clear. Ibid. Even Alabama's expert conceded that the candidates preferred by white voters in the areas that he looked at regularly defeat the candidates preferred by Black voters. Id., at 1018.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,91,"Finally, the District Court concluded that plaintiffs had carried their burden  at the totality of circumstances stage. The Court observed that elections in Alabama were racially polarized, that Black Alabamians enjoy virtually zero success in statewide elections, that political campaigns in Alabama had been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals, and that Alabama's extensive history of repugnant racial and voting-related discrimination is undeniable and well documented. Id., at 1018-1024.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,92,"We see no reason to disturb the District Court's careful factual findings, which are subject to clear error review and have gone unchallenged by Alabama in any event. See Cooper, 581 U.S. at 309, 137 S.Ct. 1455. Nor is there a basis to upset the District Court's legal conclusions. The Court faithfully applied our precedents and correctly determined that, under existing law, HB1 violated § 2.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,94,The heart of these cases is not about the law as it exists. It is about Alabama's attempt to remake our § 2 jurisprudence anew.,Roberts,0,
2022-004,95,"The centerpiece of the State's effort is what it calls the race-neutral benchmark. The theory behind it is this: Using modern computer technology, mapmakers can now generate millions of possible districting maps for a given State. The maps can be designed to comply with traditional districting criteria but to not consider race. The mapmaker can determine how many majority-minority districts exist in each map, and can then calculate the median or average number of majority-minority districts in the entire multimillion-map set. That number is called the race-neutral benchmark.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,96,"The State contends that this benchmark should serve as the point of comparison in § 2 cases. The benchmark, the State says, was derived from maps that were race-blind—maps that cannot have denied or abridged anyone's right to vote on account of race because they never took race into account in the first place. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). Courts in § 2 cases should therefore compare the number of majority-minority districts in the State's plan to the benchmark. If those numbers are similar—if the State's map resembles the benchmark in this way—then, Alabama argues, the State's map also cannot have denied or abridged anyone's right to vote on account of race. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,97,"Alabama contends that its approach should be adopted for two reasons. First, the State argues that a race-neutral benchmark best matches the text of the Voting Rights Act. Section 2 requires that the political processes be equally open. § 10301(b). What that means, the State asserts, is that the State's map cannot impose obstacles or burdens that block or seriously hinder voting on account of race. Brief for Alabama 43. These obstacles do not exist, in the State's view, where its map resembles a map that never took race into account. Ibid. Second, Alabama argues that the Gingles framework ends up requiring racial proportionality in districting. According to the State, Gingles demands that where another majority-black district could be drawn, it must be drawn. Brief for Alabama 71 (emphasis deleted). And that sort of proportionality, Alabama continues, is inconsistent with the compromise that Congress struck, with the text of § 2, and with the Constitution's prohibition on racial discrimination in voting.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,98,"To apply the race-neutral benchmark in practice, Alabama would require § 2 plaintiffs to make at least three showings. First, the illustrative plan that plaintiffs adduce for the first Gingles precondition cannot have been based on race. Brief for Alabama 56. Second, plaintiffs must show at  the totality of circumstances stage that the State's enacted plan diverges from the average plan that would be drawn without taking race into account. And finally, plaintiffs must ultimately prove that any deviation between the State's plan and a race-neutral plan is explainable only by race—not, for example, by the State's naturally occurring geography and demography. Id., at 46.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,99,"As we explain below, we find Alabama's new approach to § 2 compelling neither in theory nor in practice. We accordingly decline to recast our § 2 case law as Alabama requests.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,102,"Section 2 prohibits States from imposing any standard, practice, or procedure  in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen  to vote on account of race or color. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). What that means, § 2 goes on to explain, is that the political processes in the State must be equally open, such that minority voters do not have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. § 10301(b).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,103,"We have understood the language of § 2 against the background of the hard-fought compromise that Congress struck. To that end, we have reiterated that § 2 turns on the presence of discriminatory effects, not discriminatory intent. See, e.g., Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 403-404, 111 S.Ct. 2354, 115 L.Ed.2d 348 (1991). And we have explained that it is patently clear that Congress has used the words `on account of race or color' in the Act to mean `with respect to' race or color, and not to connote any required purpose of racial discrimination. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 71, n. 34, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (plurality opinion) (some alterations omitted). Individuals thus lack an equal opportunity to participate in the political process when a State's electoral structure operates in a manner that minimizes or cancels out their voting strength. Id., at 47, 106 S.Ct. 2752. That occurs where an individual is disabled from entering into the political process in a reliable and meaningful manner in the light of past and present reality, political and otherwise. White, 412 U.S. at 767, 770, 93 S.Ct. 2332. A district is not equally open, in other words, when minority voters face—unlike their majority peers—bloc voting along racial lines, arising against the backdrop of substantial racial discrimination within the State, that renders a minority vote unequal to a vote by a nonminority voter.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,104,"The State's reading of § 2, by contrast, runs headlong into our precedent. Alabama asserts that a State's map does not abridge a person's right to vote on account of race if the map resembles a sufficient number of race-neutral alternatives. See Brief for Alabama 54-56. But our cases have consistently focused, for purposes of litigation, on the specific illustrative maps that a plaintiff adduces. Deviation from that map shows it is possible that the State's map has a disparate effect on account of race. The remainder of the Gingles test helps determine whether that possibility is reality by looking to polarized voting preferences and the frequency of racially discriminatory actions taken by the State, past and present.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,105,"A State's liability under § 2, moreover, must be determined based on the totality of circumstances. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). Yet Alabama suggests there is only one circumstance that matters— how the State's map stacks up relative to the benchmark. That single-minded view of § 2 cannot be squared with the VRA's  demand that courts employ a more refined approach. And we decline to adopt an interpretation of § 2 that would revise and reformulate the Gingles threshold inquiry that has been the baseline of our § 2 jurisprudence for nearly forty years. Bartlett, 556 U.S., at 16, 129 S.Ct. 1231 (plurality opinion), see also Wisconsin Legislature, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1250 (faulting lower court for improperly reducing Gingles' totality-of-circumstances analysis to a single factor), De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1018, 114 S.Ct. 2647 (An inflexible rule would run counter to the textual command of § 2, that the presence or absence of a violation be assessed `based on the totality of circumstances.').3",Roberts,0,
2022-004,107,"Alabama also argues that the race-neutral benchmark is required because our existing § 2 jurisprudence inevitably demands racial proportionality in districting, contrary to the last sentence of §2(b). But properly applied, the Gingles framework itself imposes meaningful constraints on proportionality, as our decisions have frequently demonstrated.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,108,"In Shaw v. Reno, for example, we considered the permissibility of a second majority-minority district in North Carolina, which at the time had 12 seats in the U. S. House of Representatives and a 20% black voting age population. 509 U.S. 630, 633-634, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993). The second majority-minority district North Carolina drew was 160 miles long and, for much of its length, no wider than the interstate corridor. Id., at 635, 113 S.Ct. 2816. The district wound in snakelike fashion through tobacco country, financial centers, and manufacturing areas until it gobbled in enough enclaves of black neighborhoods. Id., at 635-636, 113 S.Ct. 2816. Indeed, the district was drawn so imaginatively that one state legislator remarked: If you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, you'd kill most of the people in the district. Id., at 636, 113 S.Ct. 2816.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,109,"Though North Carolina believed the additional district was required by § 2, we rejected that conclusion, finding instead that those challenging the map stated a claim of impermissible racial gerrymandering under the Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 655, 658, 113 S.Ct. 2816. In so holding, we relied on the fact that the proposed district was not reasonably compact. Id., at 647, 113 S.Ct. 2816. North Carolina had concentrated a dispersed minority population in a single district by disregarding traditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions. Ibid. (emphasis added). And a reapportionment plan that includes in one district individuals who belong to the same race, but who are otherwise separated by geographical and political boundaries, we said, raised serious constitutional concerns. Ibid. (emphasis added).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,110,"The same theme emerged in our 1995 decision Miller v. Johnson, where we upheld a district court's finding that one of Georgia's ten congressional districts was the product of an impermissible racial gerrymander. 515 U.S. 900, 906, 910-911, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762. At the time, Georgia's black voting age population was 27%, but there was only one majority-minority district. Id., at 906, 115 S.Ct. 2475. To comply with the VRA, Georgia thought it necessary to create two more  majority-minority districts—achieving proportionality. Id., at 920-921, 115 S.Ct. 2475. But like North Carolina in Shaw, Georgia could not create the districts without flouting traditional criteria. One district centered around four discrete, widely spaced urban centers that had absolutely nothing to do with each other, and stretched the district hundreds of miles across rural counties and narrow swamp corridors. 515 U.S. at 908, 115 S.Ct. 2475. Geographically, we said of the map, it is a monstrosity. Id., at 909, 115 S.Ct. 2475.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,111,"In Bush v. Vera, a plurality of the Court again explained how traditional districting criteria limited any tendency of the VRA to compel proportionality. The case concerned Texas's creation of three additional majority-minority districts. 517 U.S. at 957, 116 S.Ct. 1941. Though the districts brought the State closer to proportional representation, we nevertheless held that they constituted racial gerrymanders in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That was because the districts had no integrity in terms of traditional, neutral redistricting criteria. Id., at 960, 116 S.Ct. 1941. One of the majority-black districts consisted of narrow and bizarrely shaped tentacles. Id., at 965, 116 S.Ct. 1941. The proposed majority-Hispanic district resembled a sacred Mayan bird with spindly legs reaching south and a plumed head rising northward. Id., at 974, 116 S.Ct. 1941.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,112,"The point of all this is a simple one. Forcing proportional representation is unlawful and inconsistent with this Court's approach to implementing § 2. The numbers bear the point out well. At the congressional level, the fraction of districts in which black-preferred candidates are likely to win is currently below the Black share of the eligible voter population in every state but three. Brief for Professors Jowei Chen et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (Chen Brief). Only one State in the country, meanwhile, has attained a proportional share of districts in which Hispanic-preferred candidates are likely to prevail. Id., at 3-4. That is because as residential segregation decreases—as it has sharply done since the 1970s—satisfying traditional districting criteria such as the compactness requirement becomes more difficult. T. Crum, Reconstructing Racially Polarized Voting, 70 Duke L. J. 261, 279, and n. 105 (2020).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,113,"Indeed, as amici supporting the appellees emphasize, § 2 litigation in recent years has rarely been successful for just that reason. See Chen Brief 3-4. Since 2010, plaintiffs nationwide have apparently succeeded in fewer than ten § 2 suits. Id., at 7. And the only state legislative or congressional districts that were redrawn because of successful Section 2 challenges were a handful of state house districts near Milwaukee and Houston. Id., at 7-8. By contrast, numerous lower courts have upheld districting maps where, due to minority populations' geographic diffusion, plaintiffs couldn't design an additional majority-minority district or satisfy the compactness requirement. Id., at 15-16 (collecting cases). The same has been true of recent litigation in this Court. See Abbott, 585 U. S., at ___-___, 138 S.Ct., at 2331 (finding a Texas district did not violate § 2 because the geography and demographics of south and west Texas do not permit the creation of any more than the seven Latino  districts that exist under the current plan).4  Reapportionment, we have repeatedly observed, is primarily the duty and responsibility of the States, not the federal courts. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2324. Properly applied, the Gingles factors help ensure that remains the case. As respondents themselves emphasize, § 2 never requires adoption of districts that violate traditional redistricting principles. Brief for Respondents in No. 21-1087, p. 3. Its exacting requirements, instead, limit judicial intervention to those instances of intensive racial politics where the excessive role of race in the electoral process denies minority voters equal opportunity to participate.

2022-004,115,"Although we are content to reject Alabama's invitation to change existing law on the ground that the State misunderstands § 2 and our decisions implementing it, we also address how the race-neutral benchmark would operate in practice.

2022-004,117,"The first change to existing law that Alabama would require is prohibiting the illustrative maps that plaintiffs submit to satisfy the first Gingles precondition from being based on race. Brief for Alabama 56.

2022-004,118,"When it comes to considering race in the context of districting, we have made clear that there is a difference between being aware of racial considerations and being motivated by them.

The former is permissible, the latter is usually not. That is because redistricting legislatures will almost always be aware of racial demographics, Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475, but such race consciousness does not lead inevitably to impermissible race discrimination, Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646, 113 S.Ct. 2816. Section 2 itself demands consideration of race. Abbott, 581 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2315. The question whether additional majority-minority districts can be drawn, after all, involves a quintessentially race-conscious calculus. De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1020, 114 S.Ct. 2647.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,119,"At the same time, however, race may not be the predominant factor in drawing district lines unless there is a compelling reason. Cooper, 581 U.S. at 291, 137 S.Ct. 1455. Race predominates in the drawing of district lines, our cases explain, when race-neutral considerations come into play only after the race-based decision had been made. Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.S. 178, 189, 137 S.Ct. 788, 197 L.Ed.2d 85 (2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).

2022-004,120,"While the line between racial predominance and racial consciousness can be difficult  to discern, see Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475, it was not breached here. The Caster plaintiffs relied on illustrative maps produced by expert Bill Cooper. See 2 App. 591-592. Cooper testified that while it was necessary for him to consider race, he also took several other factors into account, such as compactness, contiguity, and population equality. Ibid. Cooper testified that he gave all these factors equal weighting. Id., at 594. And when asked squarely whether race predominated in his development of the illustrative plans, Cooper responded: No. It was a consideration. This is a Section 2 lawsuit, after all. But it did not predominate or dominate. Id., at 595.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,121,"The District Court agreed. It found Cooper's testimony highly credible and commended Cooper for working hard to give `equal weight' to all traditional redistricting criteria. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1005-1006, see also id., at 978-979. The court also explained that Alabama's evidence of racial predominance in Cooper's maps was exceedingly thin. Alabama's expert, Thomas Bryan, testified that he never reviewed the exhibits to Mr. Cooper's report and that he never reviewed one of the illustrative plans that Cooper submitted. Id., at 1006. Bryan further testified that he could offer no conclusions or opinions as to the apparent basis of any individual line drawing decisions in Cooper's illustrative plans. 2 App. 740. By his own admission, Bryan's analysis of any race predominance in Cooper's maps was pretty light. Id., at 739. The District Court did not err in finding that race did not predominate in Cooper's maps in light of the evidence before it.5",Roberts,0,
2022-004,122,"The dissent contends that race nevertheless predominated in both Cooper's and Duchin's maps because they were designed to hit `express racial targets'—namely, two 50%-plus majority-black districts. Post, at 1527 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (quoting Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 192, 137 S.Ct. 788). This argument fails in multiple ways. First, the dissent's reliance on Bethune-Hill is mistaken. In that case, this Court was unwilling to conclude that a State's maps were produced in a racially predominant manner. Instead, we remanded for the lower court to conduct the predominance analysis itself, explaining that the use of an express racial target was just one factor among others that the court would have to consider as part of a holistic analysis. Id., at 192, 137 S.Ct. 788. Justice THOMAS dissented in relevant part, contending that because the legislature sought to achieve a black voting-age population of at least 55%, race necessarily predominated in its decisionmaking. Id., at 198, 137 S.Ct. 788 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). But the Court did not join in that view, and Justice THOMAS again dissents along the same lines today.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,123,"The second flaw in the dissent's proposed approach is its inescapable consequence: Gingles must be overruled. According to the dissent, racial predominance plagues every single illustrative map ever adduced at the first step of Gingles. For all those maps were created with an express target in mind—they were created to show, as our cases require, that an additional majority-minority district could be drawn. That is the whole point of the enterprise. The upshot of the approach the dissent urges is not to change how Gingles is applied, but to reject its framework outright.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,124,The contention that mapmakers must be entirely blind to race has no footing in our § 2 case law. The line that we have long drawn is between consciousness and predominance. Plaintiffs adduced at least one illustrative map that comported with our precedents. They were required to do no more to satisfy the first step of Gingles.,Roberts,0,
2022-004,126,"The next condition Alabama would graft onto § 2 is a requirement that plaintiffs demonstrate, at the totality of circumstances stage, that the State's enacted plan contains fewer majority-minority districts than the race-neutral benchmark. Brief for Alabama 43. If it does not, then § 2 should drop out of the picture. Id., at 44.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,127,"Alabama argues that is what should have happened here. It notes that one of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Duchin, used an algorithm to create 2 million districting plans for Alabama  without taking race into account in any way in the generation process. 2 App. 710. Of these two million raceblind plans, none contained two majority-black districts while many plans did not contain any. Ibid. Alabama also points to a race-neutral computer simulation conducted by another one of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Kosuke Imai, which produced 30,000 potential maps. Brief for Alabama 55. As with Dr. Duchin's maps, none of the maps that Dr. Imai created contained two majority-black districts. See 2 App. 571-572. Alabama thus contends that because HB1 sufficiently resembles the race-neutral maps created by Dr. Duchin and Dr. Imai—all of the maps lack two majority-black districts—HB1 does not violate § 2. Brief for Alabama 54.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,128,"Alabama's reliance on the maps created by Dr. Duchin and Dr. Imai is misplaced. For one, neither Duchin's nor Imai's maps accurately represented the districting process in Alabama. Dr. Duchin's maps were based on old census data—from 2010 instead of 2020—and ignored certain traditional districting criteria, such as keeping together communities of interest, political subdivisions, or municipalities.6 And Dr. Imai's 30,000 maps failed to incorporate Alabama's own districting guidelines, including keeping together communities of interest and preserving municipal boundaries. See Supp. App. 58-59.7  But even if the maps created by Dr. Duchin and Dr. Imai were adequate comparators, we could not adopt the map-comparison test that Alabama proposes. The test is flawed in its fundamentals. Districting involves myriad considerations —compactness, contiguity, political subdivisions, natural geographic boundaries, county lines, pairing of incumbents, communities of interest, and population equality. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475. Yet quantifying, measuring, prioritizing, and reconciling these criteria requires map drawers to make difficult, contestable choices. Brief for Computational Redistricting Experts as Amici Curiae 8 (Redistricting Brief). And it is easy to imagine how different criteria could move the median map toward different distributions, meaning that the same map could be lawful or not depending solely on what the mapmakers said they set out to do. Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U. S. ___, ___-___, 139 S.Ct. 2484, 2505, 204 L.Ed.2d 931 (2019). For example, the scientific literature contains dozens of competing metrics on the issue of compactness. Redistricting Brief 8. Which one of these metrics should be used? What happens when the maps they produce yield different benchmark results? How are courts to decide?",Roberts,0,
2022-004,129,"Alabama does not say, it offers no rule or standard for determining which of these choices are better than others. Nothing in § 2 provides an answer either. In 1982, the computerized mapmaking software that Alabama contends plaintiffs must use to demonstrate an (unspecified) level of deviation did not even exist. See, e.g., J. Chen & N. Stephanopoulos, The Race-Blind Future of Voting Rights, 130 Yale L. J. 862, 881-882 (2021) (Chen & Stephanopoulos). And neither the text of § 2 nor the fraught debate that produced it suggests that equal access to the fundamental right of voting turns on computer simulations that are technically complicated, expensive to produce, and available to only a small cadre of university researchers that have the resources and expertise to run them. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (citing Chen & Stephanopoulos 882-884).8",Roberts,0,
2022-004,130,"One final point bears mentioning. Throughout these cases, Alabama has repeatedly emphasized that HB1 cannot have violated § 2 because none of plaintiffs' two million odd maps contained more than one majority-minority district. See, e.g., Brief for Alabama 1, 23, 30, 31, 54-56, 70, 79. The point is that two million is a very big number and that sheer volume matters. But as elsewhere, Alabama misconceives  the math project that it expects courts to oversee. A brief submitted by three computational redistricting experts explains that the number of possible districting maps in Alabama is at least in the trillion trillions. Redistricting Brief 6, n. 7. Another publication reports that the number of potential maps may be orders of magnitude higher: the universe of all possible connected, population-balanced districting plans that satisfy the state's requirements, it explains, is likely in the range of googols. Duchin & Spencer 768. Two million maps, in other words, is not many maps at all. And Alabama's insistent reliance on that number, however powerful it may sound in the abstract, is thus close to irrelevant in practice. What would the next million maps show? The next billion? The first trillion of the trillion trillions? Answerless questions all. See, e.g., Redistricting Brief 2 (It is computationally intractable, and thus effectively impossible, to generate a complete enumeration of all potential districting plans. Even algorithms that attempt to create a manageable sample of that astronomically large universe do not consistently identify an average or median map.), Duchin & Spencer 768 (A comprehensive survey of all districting plans within a State is impossible.).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,131,"Section 2 cannot require courts to judge a contest of computers when there is no reliable way to determine who wins, or even where the finish line is.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,133,Alabama's final contention with respect to the race-neutral benchmark is that it requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that any deviations between the State's enacted plan and race-neutral alternatives can be explained only by racial discrimination. Brief for Alabama 44 (emphasis added).,Roberts,0,
2022-004,134,"We again find little merit in Alabama's proposal. As we have already explained, our precedents and the legislative compromise struck in the 1982 amendments clearly rejected treating discriminatory intent as a requirement for liability under § 2. See, e.g., Chisom, 501 U.S. at 403-404, 111 S.Ct. 2354, Shaw, 509 U.S. at 641, 113 S.Ct. 2816, Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 481-482, 117 S.Ct. 1491, 137 L.Ed.2d 730 (1997). Yet Alabama's proposal is even more demanding than the intent test Congress jettisoned. Demonstrating discriminatory intent, we have long held, does not require a plaintiff to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purpose . Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (emphasis added), see also Reno, 520 U.S. at 488, 117 S.Ct. 1491. Alabama's proposed approach stands in sharp contrast to all this, injecting into the effects test of § 2 an evidentiary standard that even our purposeful discrimination cases eschew.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,136,Alabama finally asserts that the Court should outright stop applying § 2 in cases like these because the text of § 2 does not apply to single-member redistricting and because § 2 is unconstitutional as the District Court applied it here. We disagree on both counts.,Roberts,0,
2022-004,137,"Alabama first argues that § 2 does not apply to single-member redistricting. Echoing Justice THOMAS's concurrence in Holder v. Hall, Alabama reads § 2's reference to standard, practice, or procedure to mean only the methods for conducting a part of the voting process that might  be used to interfere with a citizen's ability to cast his vote. 512 U.S. at 917-918, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion concurring  in judgment). Examples of covered activities would include registration requirements, the locations of polling places, the times polls are open, the use of paper ballots as opposed to voting machines, and other similar aspects of the voting process. Id., at 922, 114 S.Ct. 2581. But not a single-member districting system or the selection of one set of districting lines over another. Id., at 923, 114 S.Ct. 2581.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,138,"This understanding of § 2 cannot be reconciled with our precedent. As recounted above, we have applied § 2 to States' districting maps in an unbroken line of decisions stretching four decades. See supra, at 1503-1504, see also Brnovich, 594 U. S., at ___, n. 5, 141 S.Ct., at 2333, n. 5) (collecting cases). In doing so, we have unanimously held that § 2 and Gingles certainly  apply to claims challenging single-member districts. Growe, 507 U.S. at 40, 113 S.Ct. 1075. And we have even invalidated portions of a State's single-district map under § 2. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 427-429, 126 S.Ct. 2594.9 Alabama's approach would require abandoning this precedent, overruling the interpretation of § 2 as set out in nearly a dozen of our cases. Holder, 512 U.S. at 944, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).",Roberts,0,
2022-004,139,"We decline to take that step. Congress is undoubtedly aware of our construing § 2 to apply to districting challenges. It can change that if it likes. But until and unless it does, statutory stare decisis counsels our staying the course. See, e.g., Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 456, 135 S.Ct. 2401, 192 L.Ed.2d 463 (2015).10",Roberts,0,
2022-004,140,"The statutory text in any event supports the conclusion that § 2 applies to single-member districts. Alabama's own proffered definition of a procedure is the manner or method of proceeding in a process or course of action. Brief for Alabama 51 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the manner of proceeding in the act of voting entails determining in which districts voters will vote. The fact that the term procedure is preceded by the phrase qualification or prerequisite to voting, 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a), does not change its meaning. It is hard to imagine many more fundamental prerequisites to voting than determining where to cast your ballot or who you are eligible to vote for. Perhaps for that reason, even Alabama  does not bear the courage of its conviction on this point. It refuses to argue that § 2 is inapplicable to multimember districting, though its textual arguments apply with equal force in that context.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,141,"The dissent, by contrast, goes where even Alabama does not dare, arguing that § 2 is wholly inapplicable to districting because it focuses on ballot access and counting only. Post, at 1520 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). But the statutory text upon which the dissent relies supports the exact opposite conclusion. The relevant section provides that the terms `vote' or `voting' shall include all action necessary to make a vote effective. Ibid. (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 10310(c)(1), emphasis added). Those actions include, but are not limited to, actions required by law prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot counted properly and included in the appropriate totals of votes cast. § 10310(c)(1). It would be anomalous to read the broad language of the statute— all action necessary, including but not limited to—to have the crabbed reach that Justice THOMAS posits. And we have already discussed why determining where to cast a ballot constitutes a prerequisite to voting, as the statute requires.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,142,"The dissent also contends that applying § 2 to districting rests on systematic neglect of  the ballot-access focus of the 1960s' voting-rights struggles. Post, at 1520 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). But history did not stop in 1960. As we have explained, Congress adopted the amended § 2 in response to the 1980 decision City of Mobile, a case about districting. And—as the dissent itself acknowledges—Congress drew §2(b)'s current operative language from the 1973 decision White v. Regester, post, at 1521, n. 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), a case that was also about districting (in fact, a case that invalidated two multimember districts in Texas and ordered them redrawn into single-member districts, 412 U.S. at 765, 93 S.Ct. 2332). This was not lost on anyone when § 2 was amended. Indeed, it was the precise reason that the contentious debates over proportionality raged—debates that would have made little sense if § 2 covered only poll taxes and the like, as the dissent contends.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,143,"We also reject Alabama's argument that § 2 as applied to redistricting is unconstitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment. According to Alabama, that Amendment permits Congress to legislate against only purposeful discrimination by States. See Brief for Alabama 73. But we held over 40 years ago that, even if § 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits only purposeful discrimination, the prior decisions of this Court foreclose any argument that Congress may not, pursuant to § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment outlaw voting practices that are discriminatory in effect. City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 173, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 64 L.Ed.2d 119 (1980). The VRA's ban on electoral changes that are discriminatory in effect, we emphasized, is an appropriate method of promoting the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. Id., at 177, 100 S.Ct. 1548. As City of Rome recognized, we had reached the very same conclusion in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, a decision issued right after the VRA was first enacted. 383 U.S. at 308-309, 329-337, 86 S.Ct. 803, see also Brnovich, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2330-2331.",Roberts,0,
2022-004,144,"Alabama further argues that, even if the Fifteenth Amendment authorizes the effects test of § 2, that Amendment does not authorize race-based redistricting as a remedy for § 2 violations. But for the last four decades, this Court and the lower federal courts have repeatedly applied the effects test of § 2 as interpreted in Gingles and, under certain circumstances, have authorized race-based redistricting as  a remedy for state districting maps that violate § 2. See, e.g., supra, at 1503-1504, cf. Mississippi Republican Executive Committee v. Brooks, 469 U.S. 1002, 105 S.Ct. 416, 83 L.Ed.2d 343 (1984).

2022-004,150,"First, the upshot of Alabama's argument is that the Court should overrule Gingles. But the stare decisis standard for this Court to overrule a statutory precedent, as distinct from a constitutional precedent, is comparatively strict. Unlike with constitutional precedents, Congress and the President may enact new legislation to alter statutory precedents such as Gingles. In the past 37 years, however, Congress and the President have not disturbed Gingles, even as they have made other changes to the Voting Rights Act. Although statutory stare decisis is not absolute, the Court has ordinarily left the updating or correction of erroneous statutory precedents to the legislative process. Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.

2022-004,151,"Second, Alabama contends that Gingles inevitably requires a proportional number of majority-minority districts, which in turn contravenes the proportionality disclaimer in §2(b) of the Voting Rights Act. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). But Alabama's  premise is wrong. As the Court's precedents make clear, Gingles does not mandate a proportional number of majority-minority districts. Gingles requires the creation of a majority-minority district only when, among other things, (i) a State's redistricting map cracks or packs a large and geographically compact minority population and (ii) a plaintiff's proposed alternative map and proposed majority-minority district are reasonably configured—namely, by respecting compactness principles and other traditional districting criteria such as county, city, and town lines.

And the effects test, as applied by Gingles to redistricting, requires in certain circumstances that courts account for the race of voters so as to prevent the cracking or packing—whether intentional or not—of large and geographically compact minority populations.

2022-004,155,"Fourth, Alabama asserts that § 2, as construed by Gingles to require race-based redistricting in certain circumstances, exceeds Congress's remedial or preventive authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. As the Court explains, the constitutional argument presented by Alabama is not persuasive in light of the Court's precedents. See ante, at 1516-1517, see also City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 177-178, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 64 L.Ed.2d 119 (1980). Justice THOMAS notes, however, that even if Congress in 1982 could constitutionally authorize race-based redistricting under § 2 for some period of time, the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future. See post, at 1543-1544 (dissenting opinion). But Alabama did not raise that temporal argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at this time.",Kavanaugh,0,

Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 893, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 129 L.Ed.2d 687 (1994) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)). What distinguishes them is the uncommon clarity with which they lay bare the gulf between our color-blind Constitution, Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting), and the consciously segregated districting system currently being constructed in the name of the Voting Rights Act. Holder, 512 U.S. at 907, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The question presented is whether § 2 of the Act, as amended, requires the State of Alabama to intentionally redraw its longstanding congressional districts so that black voters can control a number of seats roughly proportional to the black share of the State's population. Section 2 demands no such thing, and, if it did, the Constitution would not permit it.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,160,"At the outset, I would resolve these cases in a way that would not require the Federal Judiciary to decide the correct racial apportionment of Alabama's congressional seats. Under the statutory text, a § 2 challenge must target a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(a). I have long been convinced that those words reach only enactments that regulate citizens' access to the ballot or the processes for counting a ballot, they do not include a State's  choice of one districting scheme over another. Holder, 512 U.S. at 945, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Thus, § 2 cannot provide a basis for invalidating any district. Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. ___,  ___, 138 S.Ct. 2305, 2335, 201 L.Ed.2d 714 (2018) (THOMAS, J., concurring).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,161,"While I will not repeat all the arguments that led me to this conclusion nearly three decades ago, see Holder, 512 U.S. at 914-930, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion concurring in judgment), the Court's belated appeal to the statutory text is not persuasive. See ante, at 1515-1516. Whatever words like practice and procedure are capable of meaning in a vacuum, the prohibitions of § 2 apply to practices and procedures that affect voting and the right  to vote. §10301(a). Vote and voting are defined terms under the Act, and the Act's definition plainly focuses on ballot access and counting:",Thomas,0,
2022-004,162,"The terms `vote' or `voting' shall include all action necessary to make a vote effective in any primary, special, or general election, including, but not limited to, registration, listing pursuant to this chapter, or other action required by law prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot counted properly and included in the appropriate totals of votes cast with respect to candidates for public or party office and propositions for which votes are received in an election. §10310(c)(1).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,163,"In enacting the original Voting Rights Act in 1965, Congress copied this definition almost verbatim from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1960—a law designed to protect access to the ballot in jurisdictions with patterns or practices of denying such access based on race, and which cannot be construed to authorize so-called vote-dilution claims. See 74 Stat. 91-92 (codified in relevant part at 52 U.S.C. §10101(e)). Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which cross-referenced the 1960 Act's definition of vote, likewise protects ballot access alone and cannot be read to address vote dilution. See 78 Stat. 241 (codified in relevant part at 52 U.S.C. §10101(a)). Tellingly, the 1964 Act also used the words standard, practice, or procedure to refer specifically to voting qualifications for individuals and the actions of state and local officials in administering such requirements.1 Our entire enterprise of applying § 2 to districting rests on systematic neglect of these statutory antecedents and, more broadly, of the ballot-access focus of the 1960s' voting-rights struggles. See, e.g., Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2321, 2330, 210 L.Ed.2d 753 (2021) (describing the notorious methods by which, prior to the Voting Rights Act, States and localities deprived black Americans of the ballot: poll taxes, literacy tests, property qualifications, white primaries, and grandfather clauses (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).2",Thomas,0,
2022-004,164,"Moreover, the majority drastically overstates the stare decisissupport for applying § 2 to single-member districting plans  like the one at issue here.3 As the majority implicitly acknowledges, this Court has only applied § 2 to invalidate one single-member district in one case. See League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 447, 126 S.Ct. 2594, 165 L.Ed.2d 609 (2006) (LULAC) (opinion of Kennedy, J.). And no party in that case argued that the plaintiffs' vote-dilution claim was not cognizable. As for Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993), it held only that the threshold preconditions for challenging multimember and at-large plans must limit challenges to single-member districts with at least the same force, as it would be peculiar if a vote-dilution challenge to the (more dangerous) multimember district required a higher threshold showing than a vote-fragmentation challenge to a single-member district. Id., at 40, 113 S.Ct. 1075. Growe did not consider (or, thus, reject) an argument that § 2 does not apply to single-member districts.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,165,"In any event, stare decisis should be no barrier to reconsidering a line of cases that was based on a flawed method of statutory construction from its inception, has proved incapable of principled application after nearly four decades of experience, and puts federal courts in the business of methodically carving the country into racially designated electoral districts. Holder, 512 U.S. at 945, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). This Court has never applied stare decisis mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes, and it should not do so here. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 695, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Stare decisis did not save separate but equal, despite its repeated reaffirmation in this Court and the pervasive reliance States had placed upon it for decades. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Brown v. Board of Education, O. T. 1953, No. 1, pp. 18-30. It should not rescue modern-day forms of de jure racial balkanization—which, as these cases show, is exactly where our § 2 vote-dilution jurisprudence has led.4  II",Thomas,0,
2022-004,166,"Even if § 2 applies here, however, Alabama should prevail. The District Court found that Alabama's congressional districting map dilutes black residents' votes because, while it is possible to draw two majority-black districts, Alabama's map only has one.5 But the critical question in all vote-dilution cases is: Diluted relative to what benchmark? Gonzalez v. Aurora, 535 F.3d 594, 598 (CA7 2008) (Easterbrook, C. J.). Neither the District Court nor the majority has any defensible answer. The text of § 2 and the logic of vote-dilution claims require a meaningfully race-neutral benchmark, and no race-neutral benchmark can justify the District Court's finding of vote dilution in these cases. The only benchmark that can justify it—and the one that the District Court demonstrably applied—is the decidedly nonneutral benchmark of proportional allocation of political power based on race.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,168,"As we have long recognized, the very concept of vote dilution implies—and, indeed, necessitates—the existence of an `undiluted' practice against which the fact of dilution may be measured. Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 480, 117 S.Ct. 1491, 137 L.Ed.2d 730 (1997). In a challenge to a districting plan, a court must be able to compare a State's enacted plan with a hypothetical, undiluted plan, ibid., ascertained by an objective and workable standard. Holder, 512 U.S. at 881, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (plurality opinion), see also id., at 887, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (noting the general agreement on this point).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,169,"To be sure, it is no easy task to identify an objective, undiluted benchmark against which to judge a districting plan. As we recently held in the analogous context of partisan gerrymandering, federal courts are not equipped to apportion political power as a matter of fairness. Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2484, 2499, 204 L.Ed.2d 931 (2019). Yet § 2 vote-dilution cases require nothing less. If § 2 prohibited only intentional racial discrimination, there would be no difficulty in finding a clear and workable rule of decision. But the results test that Congress wrote into § 2 to supersede Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1519, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), eschews intent as the criterion of liability. See Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. at 482, 117 S.Ct. 1491. Accordingly, a § 2 vote-dilution  claim does not simply ask  for the elimination of a racial classification. Rucho, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2502. It asks, instead, for a fair share of political power and influence, with all the justiciability conundrums that entails. Ibid. Nevertheless, if § 2 applies to single-member districts, we must accept that some objective and workable standard for choosing a reasonable benchmark exists, otherwise, single-member districts cannot be challenged as dilutive under § 2. Holder, 512 U.S. at 881, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (plurality opinion).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,170,"Given the diverse circumstances of different jurisdictions, it would be fanciful to expect a one-size-fits-all definition of the appropriate benchmark. Cf. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 79, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986) (explaining that the vote-dilution inquiry is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case and requires an intensely local appraisal (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). One overriding principle, however, should be obvious. A proper districting benchmark must be race neutral: It must not assume, a priori, that an acceptable plan should include any particular number or proportion of minority-controlled districts.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,171,"I begin with § 2's text. As relevant here, §2(a) prohibits a State from imposing or applying any electoral rule in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right  to vote on account of race or color. §10301(a). Section 2(b) then provides that §2(a) is violated",Thomas,0,
2022-004,172,"if, based on the totality of circumstances, the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State are not equally open to participation by members of a protected class in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State  is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population. §10301(b).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,173,"As we held two Terms ago in Brnovich, the equal openness requirement is the core and touchstone of §2(b), with equal opportunity serving an ancillary function.6 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2338. Relying significantly on §2(b)'s disclaimer of a right to proportional representation, we also held that § 2 does not enact a freewheeling disparate-impact regime. Id., at ___, and n. 14, 141 S.Ct., at 2341, and n. 14. Brnovich further stressed the value of benchmarks with which  challenged electoral rules can be compared, id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2338, and that a meaningful comparison is essential in judging the significance of any challenged scheme's racially disparate impact. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2339. To the extent § 2 applies to districting plans, then, it requires that they be equally open to participation by voters of all races, but it is not a pure disparate-impact statute and does not guarantee proportional representation.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,174,"In its main argument here, Alabama simply carries these principles to their logical conclusion: Any vote-dilution benchmark must be race neutral. See Brief for Appellants 32-46. Whatever equal openness means in the context of single-member  districting, no meaningful comparison is possible using a benchmark that builds in a presumption in favor of minority-controlled districts. Indeed, any benchmark other than a race-neutral one would render the vote-dilution inquiry fundamentally circular, allowing courts to conclude that a districting plan dilutes a minority's voting strength on account of race merely because it does not measure up to an ideal already defined in racial terms. Such a question-begging standard would not answer our precedents' demand for an objective, reasonable benchmark. Holder, 512 U.S. at 881, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Nor could any nonneutral benchmark be reconciled with Brnovich's rejection of a disparate-impact regime or the text's disclaimer of a right to proportional representation. 594 U. S., at ___, and n. 14, 141 S.Ct., at 2341, and n. 14).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,175,"There is yet another compelling reason to insist on a race-neutral benchmark. The Constitution abhors classifications based on race. Grutter v.

Just as the State may not, absent extraordinary justification, segregate citizens on the basis of race in its public parks, buses, golf courses, beaches, and schools, the State also may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 911, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995) (citations omitted). Districting maps that sort voters on the basis of race `are by their very nature odious.'

Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 643, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993) (Shaw I)). Accordingly, our precedents apply strict scrutiny whenever race was the predominant factor motivating the placement of a significant number of voters within or without a particular district, Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475, or, put another way, whenever race was the criterion that  could not be compromised in a district's formation.

2022-004,176,"Because racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions and undermine the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters, Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 657, 113 S.Ct. 2816, our cases have long recognized the need to interpret § 2 to avoid unnecessarily infusing race into virtually every redistricting plan. LULAC, 548 U.S. at 446, 126 S.Ct. 2594 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), accord, Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 21, 129 S.Ct. 1231, 173 L.Ed.2d 173 (2009) (plurality opinion). Plainly, however, that infusion is the inevitable result of any race-based benchmark. Any interpretation of § 2 that permits courts to condemn enacted districting plans as dilutive relative to a nonneutral benchmark would result in a substantial increase in the number of mandatory districts drawn with race as `the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision,' thus `raising serious constitutional questions.'

2022-004,178,"The plaintiffs in these cases seek a proportional allocation of political power according  to race. Holder, 512 U.S. at 936, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). According to the 2020 census, black Alabamians account for 27.16% of the State's total population and 25.9% of its voting-age population, both figures slightly less than two-sevenths. Of Alabama's seven existing congressional districts, one, District 7, is majority-black.7 These cases were brought to compel the creation of two majority-minority congressional districts—roughly proportional control. 1 App. 135 (emphasis added), see also id., at 314 (Plaintiffs seek an order  ordering a congressional redistricting plan that includes two majority-Black congressional districts).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,179,"Remarkably, the majority fails to acknowledge that two minority-controlled districts would mean proportionality, or even that black Alabamians are about two-sevenths of the State. Yet that context is critical to the issues before us, not least because it explains the extent of the racial sorting the plaintiffs' goal would require. As a matter of mathematics, single-member districting tends to deal out representation far short of proportionality to virtually all minorities, from environmentalists in Alaska to Republicans in Massachusetts. M. Duchin & D. Spencer, Models, Race, and the Law, 130 Yale L. J. Forum 744, 752 (2021) (Duchin & Spencer). As such, creating two majority-black districts would require Alabama to aggressively sort voters on the basis of race. Wisconsin Legislature, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1248.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,180,"The plaintiffs' 11 illustrative maps make that clear. All 11 maps refashion existing District 2 into a majority-black district while preserving the current black majority in District 7. They all follow the same approach: Starting with majority-black areas of populous Montgomery County, they expand District 2 east and west to encompass predominantly majority-black areas throughout the rural Black Belt. In the process, the plans are careful to leave enough of the Black Belt for District 7 to maintain its black majority. Then—and critically—the plans have District 2 extend a southwestern tendril into Mobile County to capture a dense, high-population majority-black  cluster in urban Mobile.8 See Supp. App. 184, 186, 188, 190, 193, 195, 197, 199, 201, 203, see also id., at 149.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,181,"Those black Mobilians currently reside in the urban heart of District 1. For 50 years, District 1 has occupied the southwestern pocket of Alabama, consisting of the State's two populous Gulf Coast counties (Mobile and Baldwin) as well as some less populous areas to the immediate north and east. See id., at 205-211. It is indisputable that the Gulf Coast region is the sort of community of interest that the Alabama Legislature might reasonably think a congressional district should be built around. It contains Alabama's only coastline, its fourth largest city, and the Port of Mobile. Its physical geography runs north along the Alabama and Mobile Rivers, whose paths District 1 follows. Its economy is tied to the Gulf—to shipping, shipbuilding, tourism, and commercial fishing. See Brief for Coastal Alabama Partnership as Amicus Curiae 13-15.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,182,"But, for the plaintiffs to secure their majority-black District 2, this longstanding, compact, and eminently sensible district must be radically transformed. In the Gulf Coast region, the newly drawn District 1 would retain only the majority-white areas that District 2 did not absorb on its path to Mobile's large majority-black population. To make up the lost population, District 1 would have to extend eastward through largely majority-white rural counties along the length of Alabama's border with the Florida panhandle. The plaintiffs do not assert that white residents on the Gulf Coast have anything special in common with white residents in those communities, and the District Court made no such finding. The plaintiffs' maps would thus reduce District 1 to the leftover white communities of the southern fringe of the State, its shape and constituents defined almost entirely by the need to make District 2 majority-black while also retaining a majority-black District 7.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,183,"The plaintiffs' mapmaking experts left little doubt that their plans prioritized race over neutral districting criteria. Dr. Moon Duchin, who devised four of the plans, testified that achieving two majority-black districts was a nonnegotiable principle in her eyes, a status shared only by our precedents' population balance requirement. 2 App. 634, see also id., at 665, 678. Only after those two nonnegotiables were satisfied did Dr. Duchin then give lower priority to contiguity and compactness. Id., at 634. The architect of the other seven maps, William Cooper, considered minority voting strength a traditional redistricting principle in its own right, id., at 591, and treated the minority population in and of itself as the paramount community of interest in his plans, id., at 601.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,184,"Statistical evidence also underscored the illustrative maps' extreme racial sorting. Another of the plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Kosuke Imai, computer generated 10,000 districting plans using a race-blind algorithm programmed to observe several objective districting criteria.

Dr. Imai generated another 20,000 plans using the same algorithm, but with the additional constraint that they must contain at least one majority-black district, none of those plans contained a second majority-black  district, or even a second district with a black voting-age population above 40%. Id., at 54, 67, 71-72. In a similar vein, Dr. Duchin testified about an academic study in which she had randomly generated 2 million districting plans for Alabama using a race-neutral algorithm that gave priority to compactness and contiguity. 2 App. 710, see Duchin & Spencer 765. She found some plans with one majority-black district, but never found a second majority-black district in 2 million attempts. 2 App. 710.

2022-004,185,"The plurality of Justices who join Part III-B-I of THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion appear to agree that the plaintiffs could not prove the first precondition of their statewide vote-dilution claim—that black Alabamians could constitute a majority in two reasonably configured districts, Wisconsin Legislature, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1248—by drawing an illustrative map in which race was predominant. See ante, at 1511-1512. That should be the end of these cases, as the illustrative maps here are palpable racial gerrymanders. The plaintiffs' experts clearly applied express racial targets by setting out to create 50%-plus majority-black districts in both Districts 2 and 7. Bethune-Hill v.

Again, the maps' key design features are: (1) making District 2 majority-black by connecting black residents in one metropolitan area (Montgomery) with parts of the rural Black Belt and black residents in another metropolitan area (Mobile), (2) leaving enough of the Black Belt's majority-black rural areas for District 7 to maintain its majority-black status, and (3) reducing District 1 to the white remainder of the southern third of the State.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,186,"If the State did this, we would call it a racial gerrymander, and rightly so. We would have no difficulty recognizing race as the predominant factor motivating the placement of significant numbers of voters within or without Districts 1, 2, and 7. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475. The stark splits in the racial composition of populations moved into and out of Districts 1 and 2 would make that obvious. Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 192, 137 S.Ct. 788. So would the manifest absence of any nonracial justification for the new District 1. And so would the State's clear intent to ensure that both Districts 2 and 7 hit their preordained racial targets. See ibid. (noting that pursuit of a common redistricting policy toward multiple districts may show predominance). That the plan delivered proportional control for a particular minority—a statistical anomaly that over 2 million race-blind simulations did not yield and 20,000 race-conscious simulations did not even approximate—would be still further confirmation.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,187,"The State could not justify such a plan simply by arguing that it was less bizarre to the naked eye than other, more elaborate racial gerrymanders we have encountered. See ante, at 1508-1509 (discussing  cases). As we held in Miller, visual bizarreness is not a necessary element of the constitutional wrong, only persuasive circumstantial evidence. 515 U.S. at 912-913, 115 S.Ct. 2475.10",Thomas,0,
2022-004,188,"Nor could such a plan be explained by supposed respect for the Black Belt. For present purposes, I accept the District Court's finding that the Black Belt is a significant community of interest. But the entire black population of the Black Belt— some 300,000 black residents, see Supp. App. 33—is too small to provide a majority in a single congressional district, let alone two.11 The black residents needed to populate majority-black versions of Districts 2 and 7 are overwhelmingly concentrated in the urban counties of Jefferson (i.e., the Birmingham metropolitan area, with about 290,000 black residents), Mobile (about 152,000 black residents), and Montgomery (about 134,000 black residents). Id., at 83. Of the three, only Montgomery County is in the Black Belt. The plaintiffs' maps, therefore, cannot and do not achieve their goal of two majority-black districts by joining together the Black Belt, as the majority seems wrongly to believe. Ante, at 1505. Rather, their majority-black districts are anchored by three separate high-density clusters of black residents in three separate metropolitan areas, two of them outside the Black Belt. The Black Belt's largely rural remainder is then divided between the two districts to the extent needed to fill out their population numbers with black majorities in both. Respect for the Black Belt as a community of interest cannot explain this approach. The only explanation is the plaintiffs' express racial target: two majority-black districts and statewide proportionality.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,189,"The District Court nonetheless found that race did not predominate in the plaintiffs' illustrative maps because Dr. Duchin and Mr. Cooper prioritized race only as necessary to draw two reasonably compact majority-Black congressional districts, as opposed to maximizing the  number of majority-Black districts, or the BVAP black voting-age population in any particular majority-Black district. Singleton v. Merrill, 582 F.Supp.3d 924, 1029-1030 (ND Ala. 2022) (per curiam). This reasoning shows a profound misunderstanding of our racial-gerrymandering precedents. As explained above, what triggers strict scrutiny is the intentional use of a racial classification in placing a significant number of voters within or without a particular district. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475. Thus, any plan whose predominant purpose is to achieve a nonnegotiable, predetermined racial target in a nonnegotiable, predetermined number of districts is a racial gerrymander subject to strict scrutiny. The precise fraction used as the racial target, and the number of districts it is applied to, are irrelevant.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,190,"In affirming the District Court's nonpredominance finding, the plurality glosses over these plain legal errors,12 and it entirely ignores Dr. Duchin's plans—presumably because her own explanation of her method sounds too much like textbook racial predominance. Compare 2 App. 634 (After  what I took to be nonnegotiable principles of population balance and seeking two majority-black districts, after that, I took contiguity as a requirement and compactness as paramount (emphasis added)) and id., at 635 (I took  county integrity to take precedence over the level of black voting-age population once that level was past 50 percent (emphasis added)), with Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 189, 137 S.Ct. 788 (explaining that race predominates when it `was the criterion that could not be compromised,' and race-neutral considerations `came into play only after the race-based decision had been made' (quoting Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 907, 116 S.Ct. 1894)), and Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (explaining that race predominates when the mapmaker subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles  to racial considerations). The plurality thus affirms the District Court's finding only in part and with regard to Mr. Cooper's plans alone.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,191,"In doing so, the plurality acts as if the only relevant evidence were Mr. Cooper's testimony about his own mental state and the State's expert's analysis of Mr. Cooper's maps. See ante, at 1510-1511. Such a blinkered view of the issue is unjustifiable. All 11 illustrative maps follow the same approach to creating two majority-black districts. The essential design features of Mr. Cooper's maps are indistinguishable from Dr. Duchin's, and it is those very design features that would require race to predominate. None of the  plaintiffs' maps could possibly be drawn by a mapmaker who was merely aware of, rather than motivated by, racial demographics. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475. They could only ever be drawn by a mapmaker whose predominant motive was hitting the express racial target of two majority-black districts. Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 192, 137 S.Ct. 788.13",Thomas,0,
2022-004,192,"The plurality endeavors in vain to blunt the force of this obvious fact. See ante, at 1511-1512. Contrary to the plurality's apparent understanding, nothing in Bethune-Hill suggests that an express racial target is not highly probative evidence of racial predominance. 580 U.S. at 192, 137 S.Ct. 788 (placing express racial targets alongside stark splits in the racial composition of redistricted populations as relevant districtwide evidence). That the Bethune-Hill majority declined to act as a `court of  first view,' instead leaving the ultimate issue of predominance for remand, cannot be transmuted into such an implausible holding or, in truth, any holding at all. Id., at 193, 137 S.Ct. 788.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,193,"The plurality is also mistaken that my predominance analysis would doom every illustrative map a § 2 plaintiff ever adduced. Ante, at 1511-1512 (emphasis deleted). Rather, it would mean only that—because § 2 requires a race-neutral benchmark—plaintiffs cannot satisfy their threshold burden of showing a reasonably configured alternative plan with a proposal that could only be viewed as a racial gerrymander if enacted by the State. This rule would not bar a showing, in an appropriate case, that a State could create an additional majority-minority district through a reasonable redistricting process in which race did not predominate. It would, on the other hand, screen out efforts to use § 2 to push racially proportional districting to the limits of what a State's geography and demography make possible—the approach taken by the illustrative maps here.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,195,"The foregoing analysis should be enough to resolve these cases: If the plaintiffs have not shown that Alabama could create two majority-black districts without resorting to a racial gerrymander, they cannot have shown that Alabama's one-majority-black-district map dilutes black Alabamians' voting strength relative to any meaningfully race-neutral benchmark. The inverse, however, is not true: Even if it were possible to regard the illustrative maps as not requiring racial predominance, it would not necessarily follow that a two-majority-black-district map was an appropriate benchmark. All that might follow is that the illustrative maps were reasonably configured —in other words, that they were consistent with some reasonable application  of traditional districting criteria in which race did not predominate. See LULAC, 548 U.S. at 433, 126 S.Ct. 2594. But, in virtually all jurisdictions, there are countless possible districting schemes that could be considered reasonable in that sense. The mere fact that a plaintiff's illustrative map is one of them cannot justify making it the benchmark against which other plans should be judged. Cf. Rucho, 588 U. S., at ___-___, 139 S.Ct., at 2500-2501 (explaining the lack of judicially manageable standards for evaluating the relative fairness of different applications of traditional districting criteria).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,196,"That conceptual gap—between reasonable and benchmark—is highly relevant here. Suppose, for argument's sake, that Alabama reasonably could decide to create two majority-black districts by (1) connecting Montgomery's black residents with Mobile's black residents, (2) dividing up the rural parts of the Black Belt between that district and another district with its population core in the majority-black parts of the Birmingham area, and (3) accepting the extreme disruption to District 1 and the Gulf Coast that this approach would require. The plaintiffs prefer that approach because it allows the creation of two majority-black districts, which they think Alabama should have. But even if that approach were reasonable, there is hardly any compelling race-neutral reason to elevate such a plan to a benchmark against which all other plans must be measured. Nothing in Alabama's geography or demography makes it clearly the best way, or even a particularly attractive way, to draw three of seven equally populous districts. The State has obvious legitimate, race-neutral reasons to prefer its own map—most notably, its interest in preserving the cores of prior districts and the Gulf Coast community of interest in District 1. Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 740, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983). And even discounting those interests would not yield a race-neutral case for treating the plaintiffs' approach as a suitable benchmark: Absent core retention, there is no apparent race-neutral reason to insist that District 7 remain a majority-black district uniting Birmingham's majority-black neighborhoods with majority-black rural areas in the Black Belt.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,197,"Finally, it is surely probative that over 2 million race-neutral simulations did not yield a single plan with two majority-black districts, and even 20,000 simulations with a one-majority-black-district floor did not yield a second district with a black voting-age population over 40%. If any plan with two majority-black districts would be an out-out-out-outlier within the likely universe of race-neutral districting plans, Rucho, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2518 (KAGAN, J., dissenting), it is hard to see how the mere possibility of drawing two majority-black districts could show that a one-district map diluted black Alabamians' votes relative to any appropriate benchmark.14  D",Thomas,0,
2022-004,198,"Given all this, by what benchmark did the District Court find that Alabama's enacted plan was dilutive? The answer is as simple as it is unlawful: The District Court applied a benchmark of proportional control based on race. To be sure, that benchmark was camouflaged by the elaborate vote-dilution framework we have inherited from Gingles. But nothing else in that framework or in the District Court's reasoning supplies an alternative benchmark capable of explaining the District Court's bottom line: that Alabama's one-majority-black-district map dilutes black voters' fair share of political power.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,199,"Under Gingles, the majority explains, there are three preconditions to a vote-dilution claim: (1) the relevant minority group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured district, (2) the minority group must be politically cohesive, and (3) the majority group must vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to defeat the minority's preferred candidates. Ante, at 1503 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). If these preconditions are satisfied, Gingles instructs courts to consider the totality of the circumstances and to determine, based upon a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality, whether the political process is equally open to minority voters. 478 U.S. at 79, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,200,"The majority gives the impression that, in applying this framework, the District Court merely followed a set of well-settled, determinate legal principles. But it is widely acknowledged that Gingles and its progeny have engendered considerable disagreement and uncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim, with commentators noting the lack of any `authoritative resolution of the basic questions one would need to answer to make sense of § 2's results test.' Merrill v. Milligan, 595 U. S. ___, ___- ___, 142 S.Ct. 879, 883, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting from grant of applications for stays) (quoting C. Elmendorf, Making Sense of Section 2: Of Biased Votes, Unconstitutional Elections, and Common Law Statutes, 160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 377, 389 (2012)). If there is any area of law notorious for its many unsolved puzzles, this is it. J. Chen & N. Stephanopoulos, The Race-Blind Future of Voting Rights, 130 Yale L. J. 862, 871 (2021), see also Duchin & Spencer 758 (Vote dilution on the basis of group membership is a crucial instance of the lack of a prescribed ideal).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,201,"The source of this confusion is fundamental: Quite simply, we have never succeeded in translating the Gingles framework into an objective and workable method of identifying the undiluted benchmark. The second and third preconditions are all but irrelevant to the task. They essentially collapse into one question: Is voting racially polarized such that minority-preferred candidates consistently lose  to majority-preferred ones? See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. 2752. Even if the answer is yes, that tells a court nothing about how hard it `should' be for minority voters to elect their preferred candidates under an acceptable system. Id., at 88, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Perhaps an acceptable system is one in which the minority simply cannot elect its preferred candidates, it is, after all, a minority. Rejecting that outcome as dilutive requires a value judgment relative to a benchmark that polarization alone cannot provide.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,202,"The first Gingles precondition is only marginally more useful. True, the benchmark in a redistricting challenge must be a hypothetical, undiluted plan, Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. at 480, 117 S.Ct. 1491, and the first precondition at least requires plaintiffs to identify some hypothetical alternative plan. Yet that alternative plan need only be reasonably configured, and—as explained above—to say that a plan is reasonable is a far cry from establishing an objective standard of fairness.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,203,"That leaves only the Gingles framework's final stage: the totality-of-circumstances determination whether a State's political process is equally open to minority voters. 478 U.S. at 79, 106 S.Ct. 2752. But this formulation is mere verbiage unless one knows what an equally open system should look like—in other words, what the benchmark is. And, our cases offer no substantive guidance on how to identify the undiluted benchmark at the totality stage. The best they have to offer is a grab bag of amorphous factors— widely known as the Senate factors, after the Senate Judiciary Committee Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to § 2—that Gingles said typically may be relevant to a § 2 claim. See id., at 44-45, 106 S.Ct. 2752. Those factors, however, amount to no more than a list of possible considerations that might be consulted by a court attempting to develop a gestalt view of the political and racial climate in a jurisdiction. Holder, 512 U.S. at 938, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Such a gestalt view is far removed from the necessary benchmark of a hypothetical, undiluted districting plan.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,204,"To see this, one need only consider the District Court's use of the Senate factors here. See 582 F.Supp.3d at 1018-1024. The court began its totality-stage analysis by reiterating what nobody disputes: that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with black voters overwhelmingly preferring Democrats and white voters largely preferring Republicans. To rebut the State's argument that this pattern is attributable to politics, not race per se, the court noted that Donald Trump (who is white) prevailed over Ben Carson (who is black) in the 2016 Republican Presidential primary. Next, the court observed that black candidates rarely win statewide elections in Alabama and that black state legislators overwhelmingly come from majority-minority districts. The court then reviewed Alabama's history of racial discrimination, noted other voting-rights cases in which the State was found liable, and cataloged socioeconomic disparities between black and white Alabamians in everything from car ownership to health insurance coverage. The court attributed these disparities at least in part to the State's history of discrimination and found that they hinder black residents from participating in politics today, notwithstanding the fact that black and white Alabamians register and turn out to vote at similar rates. Id., at 1021-1022. Last, the court interpreted a handful of comments by three white politicians as racial campaign appeals. Id., at 1023-1024.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,205,"In reviewing this march through the Senate factors, it is impossible to discern any overarching standard or central question, only what might be called an impressionistic moral audit of Alabama's racial past and present. Nor is it possible to determine any logical nexus between this audit and the remedy ordered: a congressional districting plan in which black Alabamians can control more than one seat. Given the District Court's finding that two reasonably configured majority-black districts could be drawn, would Alabama's one-district map have been acceptable if Ben Carson had won the 2016 primary, or if a greater number of black Alabamians owned cars?",Thomas,0,
2022-004,206,The idea that such factors could explain the District Court's judgment line is absurd. The plaintiffs' claims pose one simple question: What is the right number of Alabama's congressional seats that black voters who support Democrats should control? Neither the Senate factors nor the Gingles framework as a whole offers any principled answer.,Thomas,0,
2022-004,207,"In reality, the limits of the Gingles preconditions and the aimlessness of the totality-of-circumstances inquiry left the District Court only one obvious and readily administrable option: a benchmark of allocation of seats in direct proportion to the minority group's percentage in the population. Holder, 512 U.S. at 937, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). True, as discussed above, that benchmark is impossible to square with what the majority calls §2(b)'s robust disclaimer against proportionality, ante, at 1500-1501, and it runs headlong into grave constitutional problems. See Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 730, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 168 L.Ed.2d 508 (2007) (plurality opinion). Nonetheless, the intuitive pull of proportionality is undeniable. Once one accepts the proposition that the effectiveness of votes is measured in terms of the control of seats, the core of any vote dilution claim is inherently based on ratios between the numbers of the minority in the population and the numbers of seats controlled, and there is no more logical ratio than direct proportionality. Holder, 512 U.S. at 902, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Combine that intuitive appeal with the lack of any better alternative identified in our case law to date, id., at 937, 114 S.Ct. 2581, and we should not be surprised to learn that proportionality generally explains the results of § 2 cases after the Gingles preconditions are satisfied. See E. Katz, M. Aisenbrey, A. Baldwin, E. Cheuse, & A. Weisbrodt, Documenting Discrimination in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Since 1982, 39 U. Mich. J. L. Reform 643, 730-732 (2006) (surveying lower court cases and finding a near-perfect correlation between proportionality findings and liability results).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,208,"Thus, in the absence of an alternative benchmark, the vote-dilution inquiry has a strong and demonstrated tendency to collapse into a rough two-part test: (1) Does the challenged districting plan give the relevant minority group control of a proportional share of seats? (2) If not, has the plaintiff shown that some reasonably configured districting plan could better approximate proportional control? In this approach, proportionality is the ultimate benchmark, and the first Gingles precondition becomes a proxy for whether that benchmark is reasonably attainable in practice.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,209,"Beneath all the trappings of the Gingles framework, that two-part test describes how the District Court applied § 2 here. The gravitational force of proportionality is obvious throughout its opinion. At the front end, the District Court even built proportionality into its understanding of  Gingles' first precondition, finding the plaintiffs' illustrative maps to be reasonably configured in part because they provided a number of majority-Black districts roughly proportional to the Black percentage of the population. 582 F.Supp.3d at 1016. At the back end, the District Court concluded its totality analysis by revisiting proportionality and finding that it weighed decidedly in favor of the plaintiffs. Id., at 1025. While the District Court disclaimed giving overriding significance to proportionality, the fact remains that nothing else in its reasoning provides a logical nexus to its finding of a districting wrong and a need for a districting remedy. Finally, as if to leave no doubt about its implicit benchmark, the court admonished the State that any remedial plan will need to include two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close. Id., at 1033. In sum, the District Court's thinly disguised benchmark was proportionality: Black Alabamians are about two-sevenths of the State's population, so they should control two of the State's seven congressional seats.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,210,"That was error—perhaps an understandable error given the limitations of the Gingles framework, but error nonetheless. As explained earlier, any principled application of § 2 to cases such as these requires a meaningfully race-neutral benchmark. The benchmark cannot be an a priori thumb on the scale for racially proportional control.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,212,"The majority opinion does not acknowledge the District Court's express proportionality-based reasoning. That omission is of a piece with its earlier noted failures to acknowledge the well-known indeterminacy of the Gingles framework, that black Alabamians are about two-sevenths of the State's population, and that the plaintiffs here are thus seeking statewide proportionality. Through this pattern of omissions, the majority obscures the burning question in these cases. The District Court's vote-dilution finding can be justified only by a racially loaded benchmark— specifically, a benchmark of proportional control based on race. Is that the benchmark the statute demands? The majority fails to confront this question head on, and it studiously avoids mentioning anything that would require it to do so.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,213,"The same nonresponsiveness infects the majority's analysis, which is largely devoted to rebutting an argument nobody makes. Contrary to the majority's telling, Alabama does not equate the race-neutral benchmark with the median or average number of majority-minority districts in a large computer-generated set of race-blind districting plans. Ante, at 1506. The State's argument for a race-neutral benchmark is rooted in the text of § 2, the logic of votedilution claims, and the constitutional problems with any nonneutral benchmark. See Brief for Appellants 32-46. It then relies on the computer evidence in these cases, among other facts, to argue that the plaintiffs have not shown dilution relative to any race-neutral benchmark. See id., at 54-56. But the idea that race-neutral benchmark means the composite average of many computer-generated plans is the majority's alone.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,214,"After thus straw-manning Alabama's arguments at the outset, the majority muddles its own response. In a perfunctory footnote, it disclaims any holding that algorithmic map making evidence is categorically irrelevant in § 2 cases. Ante, at 1513, n. 8. That conclusion, however, is the obvious implication of the majority's reasoning and rhetoric. See ante, at 1513 (decrying a map-comparison test as flawed in its fundamentals even if it involves  concededly adequate comparators), see also ante, at 1507 (stating that the focus of § 2 analysis is on the specific illustrative maps that a plaintiff adduces, leaving unstated the implication that other algorithmically generated maps are irrelevant). The majority in effect, if not in word, thus forecloses any meaningful use of computer evidence to help locate the undiluted benchmark.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,215,"There are two critical problems with this fiat. The first, which the majority seems to recognize yet fails to resolve, is that excluding such computer evidence from view cannot be reconciled with § 2's command to consider the totality of circumstances.15 Second—and more fundamentally— the reasons that the majority gives for downplaying the relevance of computer evidence would more logically support a holding that there is no judicially manageable way of applying § 2's results test to single-member districts. The majority waxes about the myriad considerations that go into districting, the difficult, contestable choices those considerations require, and how nothing in § 2 provides an answer to the question of how well any given algorithm approximates the correct benchmark. Ante, at 1513-1514 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the end, it concludes, Section 2 cannot require courts to judge a contest of computers in which there is no reliable way to determine who wins, or even where the finish line is. Ante, at 1514.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,216,"The majority fails to recognize that whether vote-dilution claims require an undiluted benchmark is not up for debate. If § 2 applies to single-member districting plans, courts cannot dispense with an undiluted benchmark for comparison, ascertained by an objective and workable method. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. at 480, 117 S.Ct. 1491, Holder, 512 U.S. at 881, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (plurality opinion). Of course, I would be the last person to deny that defining the undiluted benchmark is difficult. See id., at 892, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (arguing that it immerses the federal courts in a hopeless project of weighing questions of political theory). But the myriad considerations and answerless questions the majority frets about, ante, at 1513, 1514, are inherent in the very enterprise of applying § 2 to single-member districts. Everything the majority says about the difficulty of defining the undiluted benchmark with computer evidence applies with equal or greater force to the task of defining it without such evidence. At their core, the majority's workability concerns are an isolated demand for rigor against the backdrop of a legal regime that has long been `inherently standardless,' and must remain so until the Court either discovers a principled and objective method of identifying the undiluted benchmark, Holder, 512 U.S. at 885, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (plurality opinion), or abandons this enterprise altogether, see id., at 945, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,217,"Ultimately, the majority has very little to say about the appropriate benchmark. What little it does say suggests that the majority sees no real alternative to the District Court's proportional-control benchmark, though it appears unwilling to say so outright. For example, in a nod to the statutory text and its equal openness requirement, the majority asserts that a district is not equally open  when minority voters face—unlike their majority peers—bloc voting along racial lines, arising against the backdrop of substantial racial discrimination within the State, that renders a minority vote unequal to a vote by a nonminority voter. Ante, at 1507. But again, we have held that dilution cannot be shown without an objective, undiluted benchmark, and this verbiage offers no guidance for how to determine it.16 Later, the majority asserts that the Gingles framework itself imposes meaningful constraints on proportionality. Ante, at 1508. But the only constraint on proportionality the majority articulates is that it is often difficult to achieve—which, quite obviously, is no principled limitation at all. Ante, at 1508-1510.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,218,"Thus, the end result of the majority's reasoning is no different from the District Court's: The ultimate benchmark is a racially proportional allocation of seats, and the main question on which liability turns is whether a closer approximation to proportionality is possible under any reasonable application of traditional districting criteria.17 This approach, moreover, is consistent with how the majority describes the role of plaintiffs' illustrative maps, as well as an unjustified practical asymmetry to which its rejection of computer evidence gives rise. Courts are to focus  on the specific illustrative maps that a plaintiff adduces, ante, at 1507-1508, by which the majority means that courts should not focus on statistical evidence showing those maps to be outliers. Thus, plaintiffs may use an algorithm to generate any number of maps that meet specified districting criteria and a preferred racial target, then, they need only produce one of those maps to show it is possible that the State's map is dilutive. Ante, at 1507 (emphasis in original). But the State may not use algorithmic evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs' map is an unsuitable benchmark for comparison—not even, apparently, if it can prove that the illustrative map is an outlier among billions or trillions of concededly adequate comparators. Ante, at 1513, 1514, see also  ante, at 1514 (rejecting sampling algorithms). This arbitrary restriction amounts to a thumb on the scale for § 2 plaintiffs— an unearned presumption that any reasonable map they put forward constitutes a benchmark against which the State's map can be deemed dilutive. And, once the comparison is framed in that way, the only workable rule of decision is proportionality. See Holder, 512 U.S. at 941-943, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,219,"By affirming the District Court, the majority thus approves its benchmark of proportional control limited only by feasibility, and it entrenches the most perverse tendencies of our vote-dilution jurisprudence. It guarantees that courts will continue to approach vote-dilution claims just as the District Court here did: with no principled way of determining how many seats a minority should control and with a strong temptation to bless every incremental step toward a racially proportional allocation that plaintiffs can pass off as consistent with any reasonable map.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,221,"As noted earlier, the Court has long recognized the need to avoid interpretations of § 2 that `would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.'

Today, however, by approving the plaintiffs' racially gerrymandered maps as reasonably configured, refusing to ground § 2 vote-dilution claims in a race-neutral benchmark, and affirming a vote-dilution finding that can only be justified by a benchmark of proportional control, the majority holds, in substance, that race belongs in virtually every redistricting. It thus drives headlong into the very constitutional problems that the Court has long sought to avoid. The result of this collision is unmistakable: If the District Court's application of § 2 was correct as a statutory matter, § 2 is unconstitutional as applied here.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,222,"Because the Constitution restricts consideration of race and the Voting Rights Act demands consideration of race, Abbott, 585 U.

See Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 21-22, 129 S.Ct. 1231 (plurality opinion). At this point, it is necessary to confront directly one of the more confused notions inhabiting our redistricting jurisprudence. In several cases, we have assumed that compliance with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act could be a compelling state interest, before proceeding to reject race-predominant plans or districts as insufficiently tailored to that asserted interest. See, e.g., Wisconsin Legislature, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1248, Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 292, 137 S.Ct. 1455, 197 L.Ed.2d 837 (2017), Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 915, 116 S.Ct. 1894, Miller, 515 U.S. at 921, 115 S.Ct. 2475, But we have never applied this assumption to uphold a districting plan that would otherwise violate the Constitution, and the slightest reflection on first principles should make clear why it would be problematic to do so.18 The Constitution  is supreme over statutes, not vice versa. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Therefore, if complying with a federal statute would require a State to engage in unconstitutional racial discrimination, the proper conclusion is not that the statute excuses the State's discrimination, but that the statute is invalid.",Thomas,0,

2022-004,224,"Here, as with everything else in our vote-dilution jurisprudence, the task of sound analysis is encumbered by the lack of clear principles defining § 2 liability in districting. It is awkward to examine the congruence and proportionality of a statutory rule whose very meaning exists in a perpetual state of uncertainty. The majority makes clear, however, that the primary factual predicate of a vote-dilution claim is bloc voting along racial lines that results in majority-preferred candidates defeating minority-preferred ones. Ante, at 1507, accord, Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (The theoretical basis for vote-dilution claims is that where minority and majority voters consistently prefer different candidates, the majority, by virtue of its numerical superiority, will regularly defeat the choices of minority voters). And, as I have shown, the remedial logic with which the District Court's construction of § 2 addresses that wrong rests on a proportional-control benchmark limited only by feasibility. Thus, the relevant statutory rule may be approximately stated as follows: If voting is racially polarized in a jurisdiction, and if there exists any more or less reasonably configured districting plan that would enable the minority group to constitute a majority in a number of districts roughly proportional to its share of the population, then the jurisdiction must ensure that its districting plan includes that number of majority-minority districts or something quite close.20 582 F.Supp.3d at 1033.

The Reconstruction Amendments forbid, so far as civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination against any citizen because of his race, ensuring that all citizens are equal before the law. Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 591, 16 S.Ct. 904, 40 L.Ed. 1075 (1896) (Harlan, J.).

Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48, 106 S.Ct. 2752. Nor, finally, do the Amendments establish a norm of proportional control of elected offices on the basis of race.

As applied here, the statute effectively considers it a legal wrong by the State if white Alabamians vote for candidates from one political party at high enough rates, provided that black Alabamians vote for candidates from the other party at a still higher rate.

2022-004,232,"Of course, under the logically unbounded totality-of-circumstances inquiry, a court applying § 2 can always embroider its vote-dilution determination with findings about past or present unconstitutional discrimination. But this possibility does nothing to heal either the fundamental contradictions between § 2 and the Constitution or its extreme overbreadth relative to actual constitutional wrongs. A generalized assertion of past discrimination cannot justify race-based redistricting, because it provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy. Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 909, 116 S.Ct. 1894 (internal quotation marks omitted). To justify a statute tending toward the proportional allocation of political power by race throughout the Nation, it cannot be enough that a court can recite some indefinite quantum of discrimination in the relevant jurisdiction. If it were, courts could uphold race-based remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future. Wygant v.

2022-004,233,"For an example of these baleful results, we need look no further than the congressional districts at issue here. In 1992, Alabama and a group of § 2 plaintiffs, whom a federal court chose to regard as the representatives of all African-American citizens of the State of Alabama, stipulated that the State's black population was `sufficiently compact and contiguous to comprise a single member significant majority (65% or more) African American Congressional district,' and that, `consequently,' such a `district should be created.' Wesch v. Hunt, 785 F.Supp. 1491, 1493, 1498 (SD Ala.). Accepting that stipulation, the court reworked District 7 into an irregularly shaped supermajority-black district —one that scooped up populous clusters of black voters in the disparate urban centers of Birmingham and Montgomery to connect them across a swath of largely majority-black rural areas—without even deciding whether the creation of a majority African-American district was mandated by either § 2 or the Constitution. Id., at 1499, see n. 7, supra. It did not occur to the court that the Constitution might forbid such an extreme racial gerrymander, as it quite obviously did. But, once District 7 had come into being as a racial gerrymander thought necessary to satisfy § 2, it became an all-but-immovable fixture of Alabama's districting scheme.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,234,"Now, 30 years later, the plaintiffs here demand that Alabama carve up not two but three of its main urban centers on the basis of race, and that it configure those urban centers' black neighborhoods with the outlying majority-black rural areas so that black voters can control not one but two of the State's seven districts. The Federal Judiciary now upholds their demand— overriding the State's undoubted interest in preserving the core of its existing districts, its plainly reasonable desire to maintain the Gulf Coast region as a cohesive political unit, and its persuasive arguments that a race-neutral districting process would not produce anything like the districts the plaintiffs seek. Our reasons for doing so boil down to these: that the plaintiffs' proposed districts are more or less within the vast universe of reasonable districting outcomes, that Alabama's white voters do not support the black minority's preferred candidates, that Alabama's racial climate, taken as a rarefied whole, crosses some indefinable line justifying our interference, and, last but certainly not least, that black Alabamians are about two-sevenths of the State's overall population.",Thomas,0,

We have even put ourselves in the ridiculous position of assuming that compliance with a statute can excuse disobedience to the Constitution.

2022-004,236,"The majority deflects this conclusion by appealing to two of our older Voting Rights Act cases, City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 64 L.Ed.2d 119 (1980), and South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769, that did not address § 2 at all and, indeed, predate Congress' adoption of the results test. Ante, at 1516-1517, That maneuver is untenable. Katzenbach upheld § 5's preclearance requirements, §4(b)'s original coverage formula, and other related provisions aimed at a small number of States and political subdivisions where systematic resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment had long been flagrant. 383 U.S. at 328, 86 S.Ct. 803, see also id., at 315-317, 86 S.Ct. 803 (describing the limited issues presented). Fourteen years later, City of Rome upheld the 1975 Act extending § 5's preclearance provisions for another seven years. See 446 U.S. at 172-173, 100 S.Ct. 1548. The majority's reliance on these cases to validate a statutory rule not there at issue could make sense only if we assessed the congruence and proportionality of the Voting Rights Act's rules wholesale, without considering their individual features, or if Katzenbach and City of Rome meant that Congress has plenary power to enact whatever rules it chooses to characterize as combating discriminatory  effects. Ante, at 1516 (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither proposition makes any conceptual sense or is consistent with our cases. See, e.g., Shelby County, 570 U.S. at 550-557, 133 S.Ct. 2612 (holding the 2006 preclearance coverage formula unconstitutional), Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009) (emphasizing the distinctness of §§ 2 and 5), City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (discussing City of Rome as a paradigm case of congruence-and-proportionality review of remedial legislation), Miller, 515 U.S. at 927, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (stressing that construing § 5 to require that States engage in presumptively unconstitutional race-based districting would raise troubling and difficult constitutional questions, notwithstanding City of Rome).",Thomas,0,
2022-004,237,"In fact, the majority's cases confirm the very limits on Congress' enforcement powers that are fatal to the District Court's construction of § 2. City of Rome, for example, immediately after one of the sentences quoted by the majority, explained the remedial rationale for its approval of the 1975 preclearance extension: Congress could rationally have concluded that, because electoral changes by jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination in voting create the risk of purposeful discrimination, it was proper to prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact. 446 U.S. at 177, 100 S.Ct. 1548 (emphasis added, footnote omitted). The next section of City of Rome then separately examined and upheld the reasonableness of the extension's 7-year time period. See id., at 181-182, 100 S.Ct. 1548. City of Rome thus stands for precisely the propositions for which City of Boerne cited it: Congress may adopt preventive measures  when there is reason to believe that many of the laws  affected by the congressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being unconstitutional, 521 U.S. at 532, 117 S.Ct. 2157, particularly when it employs termination dates, geographic restrictions, or egregious predicates that tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate, id., at 533, 117 S.Ct. 2157, see also id., at 532-533, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (analyzing Katzenbach in similar terms), Shelby County, 570 U.S. at 535, 545-546, 133 S.Ct. 2612 (same). Again, however, the amended § 2 lacks any such salutary limiting principles, it is unbounded in time, place, and subject matter, and its districting-related commands have no nexus to any likely constitutional wrongs.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,238,"In short, as construed by the District Court, § 2 does not remedy or deter unconstitutional discrimination in districting in any way, shape, or form. On the contrary, it requires it, hijacking the districting process to pursue a goal that has no legitimate claim under our constitutional system: the proportional allocation of political power on the basis of race. Such a statute cannot be considered remedial, preventive legislation, and the race-based redistricting it would command cannot be upheld under the Constitution.

2022-004,240,"These cases are not close. The plaintiffs did not prove that Alabama's districting plan imposes or applies any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure that effects a denial or abridgement of their right  to vote on account of race or color. §10301(a). Nor did they prove that Alabama's congressional districts are not equally open to participation by black Alabamians. §10301(b). The plaintiffs did not even prove that it is possible to achieve two majority-black districts without resorting to a racial gerrymander. The most that they can be said to have shown is that sophisticated mapmakers can proportionally allocate Alabama's congressional districts based on race in a way that exceeds the Federal Judiciary's ability to recognize as a racial gerrymander with the naked eye. The District Court held that this showing, plus racially polarized voting and its gestalt view of Alabama's racial climate, was enough to require the State to redraw its districting plan on the basis of race. If that is the benchmark for vote dilution under § 2, then § 2 is nothing more than a racial entitlement to roughly proportional control of elective offices—limited only by feasibility—wherever different racial groups consistently prefer different candidates.",Thomas,0,
2022-004,241,"If that is what § 2 means, the Court should hold that it is unconstitutional. If that is not what it means, but § 2 applies to districting, then the Court should hold that vote-dilution challenges require a race-neutral benchmark that bears no resemblance to unconstitutional racial registers. On the other hand, if the Court believes that finding a race-neutral benchmark is as impossible as much of its rhetoric suggests, it should hold that  § 2 cannot be applied to single-member districting plans for want of an objective and workable standard for choosing a reasonable benchmark. Holder, 512 U.S. at 881, 114 S.Ct. 2581 (plurality opinion). Better yet, it could adopt the correct interpretation of § 2 and hold that a single-member districting plan is not a voting qualification, a prerequsite to voting, or a standard, practice, or procedure, as the Act uses those terms. One way or another, the District Court should be reversed.",Thomas,0,

It goes out of its way to reaffirm § 2's applicability to single-member districting plans both as a purported original matter and on highly exaggerated stare decisis grounds. It virtually ignores Alabama's primary argument—that, whatever the benchmark is, it must be race neutral —choosing, instead, to quixotically joust with an imaginary adversary. In the process, it uses special pleading to close the door on the hope cherished by some thoughtful observers, see Gonzalez, 535 F.3d at 599-600, that computational redistricting methods might offer a principled, race-neutral way out of the thicket Ginglescarried us into.

I share the perception, but I cannot understand the sentiment. It is true that, under our direction, federal courts have been engaged in methodically carving the country into racially designated electoral districts for decades now.

The `inherent tension'—indeed, I would call it an irreconcilable conflict—between the standards we have adopted for evaluating vote dilution claims and the text of the Voting Rights Act would itself be sufficient in my view to warrant overruling the interpretation of § 2 set out in Gingles.

Under that framework, a plaintiff must satisfy three preconditions. Id., at 50, 106 S.Ct. 2752. As summarized in more recent opinions, they are as follows:",Alito,0,
2022-004,253,"First, the `minority group' whose interest the plaintiff represents must be `sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority' in some reasonably configured legislative district. Second, the minority group must be `politically cohesive.' And third, a district's white majority must `vote sufficiently as a bloc' to usually `defeat the minority's preferred candidate.' Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 301-302, 137 S.Ct. 1455, 197 L.Ed.2d 837 (2017) (citations omitted).",Alito,0,

S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 879, 886-888, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (KAGAN, J., dissenting from grant of applications for stays).",Alito,0,
2022-004,255,"If a § 2 plaintiff can satisfy all these preconditions, the court must then decide whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the plaintiff's right to vote was diluted. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46-48, 79, 106 S.Ct. 2752. And to aid in that inquiry, Gingles approved consideration of a long list of factors set out in the Senate Judiciary Committee's Majority Report on the 1982 VRA amendments. Id., at 44-45, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417, pp. 28-30 (1982)).",Alito,0,
2022-004,257,"My fundamental disagreement with the Court concerns the first Gingles precondition. In cases like these, where the claim is that § 2 requires the creation of an additional majority-minority district, the first precondition means that the plaintiff must produce an additional illustrative majority-minority district that is reasonably configured. Cooper, 581 U.S. at 301, 137 S.Ct. 1455, Wisconsin Legislature, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1248, see also Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50, 106 S.Ct. 2752.",Alito,0,
2022-004,258,"The Court's basic error is that it misunderstands what it means for a district to be reasonably configured. Our cases make it clear that reasonably configured is not a synonym for compact. We have explained that the first precondition also takes into account other traditional districting criteria like attempting to avoid the splitting of political subdivisions and communities of interest. League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 433-434, 126 S.Ct. 2594, 165 L.Ed.2d 609 (2006) (LULAC).",Alito,0,
2022-004,259,"To its credit, the Court recognizes that compactness is not enough and that a district is not reasonably configured if it flouts other traditional districting criteria. Ante, at 1503. At various points in its opinion it names quite a few: minimizing the splitting of counties and other political subdivisions, keeping communities of interest together where possible, and avoiding the creation of new districts that require two incumbents to run against each other. Ante, at 1504-1505, 1512-1513. In addition, the Court acknowledges that a district is not reasonably configured if it does not comport with the Equal Protection  Clause's one-person, one-vote requirement. Ante, at 1513. But the Court fails to explain why compliance with traditional districting criteria matters under § 2 or why the only relevant equal protection principle is the one-person, one-vote requirement. If the Court had attempted to answer these questions, the defect in its understanding of the first Gingles precondition would be unmistakable.",Alito,0,
2022-004,260,"To explain this, I begin with what is probably the most frequently mentioned traditional districting criterion and ask why it should matter under § 2 whether a proposed majority-minority district is compact. Neither the Voting Rights Act (VRA) nor the Constitution imposes a compactness requirement. The Court notes that we have struck down bizarrely shaped districts, ante, at 1508-1509, but we did not do that for esthetic reasons. Compactness in and of itself is not a legal requirement —or even necessarily an esthetic one. (Some may find fancifully shaped districts more pleasing to the eye than boring squares.)",Alito,0,
2022-004,261,"The same is true of departures from other traditional districting criteria. Again, nothing in the Constitution or the VRA demands compliance with these criteria. If a whimsical state legislature cavalierly disregards county and municipal lines and communities of interest, draws weirdly shaped districts, departs radically from a prior map solely for the purpose of change, and forces many incumbents to run against each other, neither the Constitution nor the VRA would make any of that illegal per se. Bizarrely shaped districts and other marked departures from traditional districting criteria matter because mapmakers usually heed these criteria, and when it is evident that they have not done so, there is reason to suspect that something untoward—specifically, unconstitutional racial gerrymandering—is afoot. See, e.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 643-644, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993), Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 979, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 135 L.Ed.2d 248 (1996) (plurality opinion), cf.

2022-004,262,"Conspicuous violations of traditional districting criteria constitute strong circumstantial evidence of unconstitutionality. And when it is shown that the configuration of a district is attributable predominantly to race, that is more than circumstantial evidence that the district is unlawful. That is direct evidence of illegality because, as we have often held, race may not predominate in the drawing of district lines. See, e.g., Cooper, 581 U.S. at 292, 137 S.Ct. 1455, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.S. 178, 191-192, 137 S.Ct. 788, 197 L.Ed.2d 85 (2017), Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 906-907, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996) (Shaw II), Miller v.

2022-004,263,"Because non-predominance is a longstanding and vital feature of districting law, it must be honored in a Gingles plaintiff's illustrative district. If race predominated in the creation of such a district, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy both our precedent, which requires reasonably configured districts, and the terms of § 2, which demand equal openness. Two Terms ago, we engaged in a close analysis of the text of § 2 and explained that its key requirement is that the political processes leading to nomination or election must be `equally open to participation' by members of a protected class.

2022-004,265,"When the race of one group is the predominant factor in the creation of a district, that district goes beyond making the electoral process equally open to the members of the group in question. It gives the members of that group an advantage that § 2 does not require and that the Constitution may forbid. And because the creation of majority-minority districts is something of a zero-sum endeavor, giving an advantage to one minority group may disadvantage others.",Alito,0,
2022-004,267,"What all this means is that a § 2 plaintiff who claims that a districting map violates § 2 because it fails to include an additional majority-minority district must show at the outset that such a district can be created without making race the predominant factor in its creation. The plaintiff bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion on this issue, see Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 155-156, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993), White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 766, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), but a plaintiff can satisfy the former burden simply by adducing evidence—in any acceptable form—that race did not predominate.",Alito,0,
2022-004,268,"A plaintiff need not offer computer-related evidence. Once upon a time, legislative maps were drawn without using a computer, and nothing prevents a § 2 plaintiff from taking this old-school approach in creating an illustrative district. See, e.g., M. Altman, K. McDonald, & M. McDonald, From Crayons to Computers: The Evolution of Computer Use in Redistricting, 23 Soc. Sci. Computer Rev. 334, 335-336 (2005). In that event, the plaintiff can simply call upon the mapmaker to testify about the process he or she used and the role, if any, that race played in that process. The defendant may seek to refute that testimony in any way that the rules of civil procedure and evidence allow.",Alito,0,
2022-004,269,"If, as will often be the case today, a § 2 plaintiff's mapmaker uses a computer program, the expert can testify about the weight, if any, that the program gives to race. The plaintiff will presumably argue that any role assigned to race was not predominant, and the defendant can contest this by cross-examining the plaintiff's expert, seeking the actual program in discovery, and calling its own expert to testify about the program's treatment of race. After this, the trial court will be in a position to determine whether the program gave race a predominant role.",Alito,0,
2022-004,270,"This is an entirely workable scheme. It does not obligate either party to offer computer evidence, and it minimizes the likelihood of a clash between what § 2 requires and what the Constitution forbids. We have long assumed that § 2 is consistent with the Constitution. See, e.g., Cooper, 581 U.S. at 301, 137 S.Ct. 1455 (assuming States have a compelling interest in complying with § 2), Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 915, 116 S.Ct. 1894 (same), Vera, 517 U.S. at 977, 116 S.Ct. 1941 (plurality opinion) (same). But that cannot mean that every conceivable interpretation of § 2 is constitutional, and I do not understand the majority's analysis of Alabama's constitutional claim to suggest otherwise. Ante, at 1516-1517, ante, at 1518-1519 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in part).",Alito,0,
2022-004,271,"Our cases make it perfectly clear that using race as a predominant factor in drawing legislative districts is unconstitutional unless the stringent requirements of  strict scrutiny can be satisfied,2 and therefore if § 2 can be found to require the adoption of an additional majority-minority district that was created under a process that assigned race a predominant role, § 2 and the Constitution would be headed for a collision.",Alito,0,
2022-004,273,"When the meaning of a reasonably configured district is properly understood, it is apparent that the decisions below must be vacated and that the cases must be remanded for the application of the proper test. In its analysis of whether the plaintiffs satisfied the first Gingles precondition, the District Court gave much attention to some traditional districting criteria—specifically, compactness and avoiding the splitting of political subdivisions and communities of interest—but it failed to consider whether the plaintiffs had shown that their illustrative districts were created without giving race a predominant role. Singleton v. Merrill, 582 F.Supp.3d 924, 1008-1016 (ND Ala. 2022). For this reason, the District Court's § 2 analysis was deficient.",Alito,0,
2022-004,274,"It is true that the District Court addressed the question of race-predominance when it discussed and rejected the State's argument that the plaintiffs' maps violated the Equal Protection Clause, but the court's understanding of predominance was deeply flawed. The court began this part of its opinion with this revealing statement:",Alito,0,
2022-004,275,"Dr. Duchin and Mr. Cooper plaintiffs' experts testified that they prioritized race only for the purpose of determining and to the extent necessary to determine whether it was possible for the Milligan plaintiffs and the Caster plaintiffs to state a Section Two claim. As soon as they determined the answer to that question, they assigned greater weight to other traditional redistricting criteria. Id., at 1029-1030 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-004,276,"This statement overlooks the obvious point that by prioritizing race at the outset, Dr. Duchin and Mr. Cooper gave race a predominant role.",Alito,0,
2022-004,277,"The next step in the District Court's analysis was even more troubling. The court wrote, Dr. Duchin's testimony that she considered two majority-Black districts as `nonnegotiable' does not show that race played a predominant role in her districting process. Id., at 1030. But if achieving a certain objective is non-negotiable, then achieving that objective will necessarily play a predominant role. Suppose that a couple are relocating to the Washington, D. C., metropolitan area, and suppose that one says to the other, I'm flexible about where we live, but it has to be in Maryland. That's non-negotiable. Could anyone say that finding a home in Maryland was not a predominant factor in the couple's search? Or suppose that a person looking for a flight tells a travel agent, It has to be non-stop. That's non-negotiable. Could it be said that the number of stops between the city of origin and the destination was not a predominant factor in the search for a good flight? The obvious answer to both these questions is no, and the same is true about the role of race in the creation of a new district. If it is non-negotiable that the district be majority black, then race is given a predominant role.",Alito,0,
2022-004,278,"The District Court wrapped up this portion of its opinion with a passage that highlighted its misunderstanding of the first Gingles precondition. The court  thought that a § 2 plaintiff cannot proffer a reasonably configured majority-minority district without first attempting to see if it is possible to create such a district—that is, by first making the identification of such a district non-negotiable. Ibid. But that is simply not so. A plaintiff's expert can first create maps using only criteria that do not give race a predominant role and then determine how many contain the desired number of majority-minority districts.",Alito,0,
2022-004,279,"One final observation about the District Court's opinion is in order. The opinion gives substantial weight to the disparity between the percentage of majority-black House districts in the legislature's plan (14%) and the percentage of black voting-age Alabamians (27%), while the percentage in the plaintiffs' plan (29%) came closer to that 27% mark. See, e.g., id., at 946, 1016, 1018, 1025-1026, see also id., at 958-959, 969, 976, 982, 991-992, 996-997. Section 2 of the VRA, however, states expressly that no group has a right to representation in numbers equal to their proportion in the population. 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). This provision was a critical component of the compromise that led to the adoption of the 1982 amendments, as the Court unanimously agreed two Terms ago. See Brnovich, 594 U. S., at ___, and n. 14, 141 S.Ct., at 2341, and n. 14), id., at ___, n. 6, 141 S.Ct., at 2360, n. 6 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). The District Court's reasoning contravened this statutory proviso. See ante, at 1524-1525, 1534-1535 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2022-004,281,"The Court spends much of its opinion attacking what it takes to be the argument that Alabama has advanced in this litigation. I will not debate whether the Court's characterization of that argument is entirely correct, but as applied to the analysis I have just set out, the Court's criticisms miss the mark.",Alito,0,
2022-004,283,"The major theme of this part of the Court's opinion is that Alabama's argument, in effect, is that Gingles must be overruled. Ante, at 1512. But as I wrote at the beginning of this opinion, I would decide these cases under the Gingles framework. We should recognize, however, that the Gingles framework is not the same thing as a statutory provision, and it is a mistake to regard it as such. National Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U. S. ___, ___, 143 S.Ct. 1142, 1155, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023) (The language of an opinion is not always to be parsed as though we were dealing with language of a statute (quoting Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 341, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979))). In applying that framework today, we should keep in mind subsequent developments in our case law.",Alito,0,
2022-004,284,"One important development has been a sharpening of the methodology used in interpreting statutes. Gingles was decided at a time when the Court's statutory interpretation decisions sometimes paid less attention to the actual text of the statute than to its legislative history, and Gingles falls into that category. The Court quoted § 2 but then moved briskly to the Senate Report. See 478 U.S. at 36-37, 43, and n. 7, 106 S.Ct. 2752. Today, our statutory interpretation decisions focus squarely on the statutory text. National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 U. S. 109, 127, 138 S.Ct. 617, 199 L.Ed.2d 501 (2018), Puerto Rico v. Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Trust, 579 U.S. 115, 125, 136 S.Ct. 1938, 195 L.Ed.2d 298 (2016), cf. Brnovich, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2337. And as we held in Brnovich, the key requirement set out in the text of § 2 is that a State's electoral process must be `equally  open' to members of all racial groups. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2337. The Gingles framework should be interpreted in a way that gives effect to this standard.",Alito,0,
2022-004,285,"Another development that we should not ignore concerns our case law on racial predominance. Post-Gingles decisions like Miller, 515 U.S. at 920, 115 S.Ct. 2475, Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 906-907, 116 S.Ct. 1894, and Vera, 517 U.S. at 979, 116 S.Ct. 1941 (plurality opinion), made it clear that it is unconstitutional to use race as a predominant factor in legislative districting. When statutory language is susceptible of multiple interpretations, a court may shun an interpretation that raises serious constitutional doubts and instead may adopt an alternative that avoids those problems. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 836, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018). This same principle logically applies with even greater force when we interpret language in one of our prior opinions. It therefore goes without question that we should apply the Gingles framework in a way that does not set up a confrontation between § 2 and the Constitution, and understanding the first Gingles precondition in the way I have outlined achieves that result.3",Alito,0,
2022-004,287,"The Court's subsidiary criticisms of Alabama's arguments are likewise inapplicable to my analysis. The Court suggests that the centerpiece of Alabama's argument regarding the role race can permissibly play in a plaintiff's illustrative map seeks the imposition of a new rule. Ante, at 1506, 1510. But I would require only what our cases already demand: that all legislative districts be produced without giving race a predominant role.4",Alito,0,
2022-004,288,"The Court maintains that Alabama's benchmark scheme would be unworkable because of the huge number of different race-neutral maps that could be drawn. As the Court notes, there are apparently numerous competing metrics on the issue of compactness alone, and each race-neutral computer program may assign different values to each traditional districting criterion. Ante, at 1513 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Alito,0,
2022-004,289,"My analysis does not create such problems. If a § 2 plaintiff chooses to use a computer program to create an illustrative district, the court need ask only whether that program assigned race a predominant role.",Alito,0,
2022-004,290,"The Court argues that Alabama's focus on race-neutral maps cannot be squared with a totality-of-the-circumstances test because Alabama suggests there is only one `circumstance' that matters—how the State's map stacks up relative to the  benchmark maps. Ante, at 1507. My analysis, however, simply follows the Gingles framework, under which a court must first determine whether a § 2 plaintiff has satisfied three preconditions before moving on to consider the remainder of relevant circumstances. See Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40-41, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993) (unless plaintiffs establish all three preconditions, there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy).",Alito,0,
2022-004,292,"As noted, I would vacate and remand for the District Court to apply the correct understanding of Gingles in the first instance. Such a remand would require the District Court to determine whether the plaintiffs have shown that their illustrative maps did not give race a predominant role, and I will therefore comment briefly on my understanding of the relevant evidence in the record as it now stands.",Alito,0,
2022-004,294,"In my view, there is strong evidence that race played a predominant role in the production of the plaintiffs' illustrative maps and that it is most unlikely that a map with more than one majority-black district could be created without giving race such a role. An expert hired by the Milligan plaintiffs, Dr. Kosuke Imai, used a computer algorithm to create 30,000 potential maps, none of which contained two majority-black districts. See 2 App. 571-572, Supp. App. 59, 72. In fact, in 20,000 of those simulations, Dr. Imai intentionally created one majority-minority district, and yet even with one majority-minority district guaranteed as a baseline, none of those 20,000 attempts produced a second one. See 2 App. 571-572, Supp. App. 72.",Alito,0,
2022-004,295,"Similarly, Dr. Moon Duchin, another expert hired by the Milligan plaintiffs, opined that it is hard to draw two majority-black districts by accident. 2 App. 714. Dr. Duchin also referred to a study where she generated two million maps of potential district configurations in Alabama, none of which contained a second majority-minority district. Id., at 710. And the first team of trained mapmakers that plaintiff Milligan consulted was literally unable to draw a two-majority-black-district map, even when they tried. Id., at 511-512. Milligan concluded at the time that the feat was impossible. Id., at 512.",Alito,0,
2022-004,296,"The majority quibbles about the strength of this evidence, protesting that Dr. Imai's studies failed to include as controls certain redistricting criteria and that Dr. Duchin's two-million-map study was based on 2010 census data, see ante, at 1512-1513, and nn. 6-7, but this is unconvincing for several reasons. It is plaintiffs' burden to produce evidence and satisfy the Gingles preconditions, so if their experts' maps were deficient, that is no strike against Alabama. And the racial demographics of the State changed little between 2010 and 2020, Supp. App. 82, which is presumably why Dr. Duchin herself raised the older study in answering questions about her work in this litigation, see 2 App. 710. If it was impossible to draw two such districts in 2010, it surely at least requires a great deal of intentional effort now.",Alito,0,
2022-004,297,"The Court suggests that little can be inferred from Dr. Duchin's two-million-map study because two million maps are not that many in comparison to the trillion trillion maps that are possible. See ante, at 1513-1514, and n. 9. In making this argument, the Court relies entirely on an amicus brief submitted by three computational redistricting experts in support of the appellees. See Brief for Computational Redistricting Experts 2, 6, n. 7. These experts' argument concerns a complicated statistical issue, and I think it is  unwise for the Court to make their argument part of our case law based solely on this brief. By the time this amicus brief was submitted, the appellants had already filed their main brief, and it was too late for any experts with contrary views to submit an amicus brief in support of appellants. Computer simulations are widely used today to make predictions about many important matters, and I would not place stringent limits on their use in VRA litigation without being quite sure of our ground. If the cases were remanded, the parties could take up this issue if they wished and call experts to support their positions on the extent to which the two million maps in the study are or can be probative of the full universe of maps.",Alito,0,
2022-004,298,"In sum, based on my understanding of the current record, I am doubtful that the plaintiffs could get by the first Gingles precondition, but I would let the District Court sort this matter out on remand.",Alito,0,
2022-004,300,"Despite the strong evidence that two majority-minority districts cannot be drawn without singular emphasis on race, a plurality nonetheless concludes that race did not predominate in the drawing of the plaintiffs' illustrative maps.

2022-004,301,"The plurality's position seems to be that race does not predominate in the creation of a districting map so long as the map does not violate other traditional districting criteria such as compactness, contiguity, equally populated districts, minimizing county splits, etc. Ibid. But this conclusion is irreconcilable with our cases. In Miller, for instance, we acknowledged that the particular district at issue was not shaped  bizarrely on its face, but we nonetheless held that race predominated because of the legislature's overriding desire to assign black populations in a way that would create an additional majority-black district. 515 U.S. at 917, 115 S.Ct. 2475.",Alito,0,
2022-004,302,"Later cases drove home the point that conformity with traditional districting principles does not necessarily mean that a district was created without giving race a predominant role. In Cooper, we held that once it was shown that race was `the overriding reason' for the selection of a particular map, a further showing of `inconsistency between the enacted plan and traditional redistricting criteria' is unnecessary to a finding of racial predominance. 581 U.S. at 301, n. 3, 137 S.Ct. 1455 (quoting Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 190, 137 S.Ct. 788). We noted that the contrary argument was foreclosed almost as soon as it was raised in this Court. Cooper, 581 U.S. at 301, n. 3, 137 S.Ct. 1455, see also Vera, 517 U.S. at 966, 116 S.Ct. 1941 (plurality opinion) (race may still predominate even if traditional districting principles do correlate to some extent with the district's layout). Traditional redistricting principles  are numerous and malleable . By deploying those factors in various combinations and permutations, a mapmaker could construct a plethora of potential maps that look consistent with traditional, race-neutral principles. Bethune-Hill, 580 U.S. at 190, 137 S.Ct. 788. Here, a plurality allows plaintiffs to do precisely what we warned against in Bethune-Hill.",Alito,0,

The VRA's demand that States not unintentionally dilute the  votes of particular groups must be reconciled with the Constitution's demand that States generally avoid intentional augmentation of the political power of any one racial group (and thus the diminution of the power of other groups). The plurality's predominance analysis shreds that prudential concern. If a private plaintiff can demonstrate § 2 liability based on the production of a map that the State has every reason to believe it could not constitutionally draw, we have left state legislatures too little breathing room and virtually guaranteed that they will be on the losing end of a federal court's judgment.

2022-005,32,Texas raises three threshold arguments.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,33,"First, Texas argues that Reed lacks standing. We disagree. Reed sufficiently alleged an injury in fact: denial of access to the requested evidence. The state prosecutor, who is the named defendant, denied access to the evidence and thereby caused Reed's injury. And if a federal court concludes that Texas's post-conviction DNA testing procedures violate due process, that court order would eliminate the state prosecutor's justification for denying DNA testing. It is substantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order. Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464, 122 S.Ct. 2191, 153 L.Ed.2d 453 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, in terms of our `standing' precedent, the courts would have ordered a change in a legal status, and the practical consequence of that change would amount to a significant increase in the likelihood that the state prosecutor would grant access to the requested evidence and that Reed therefore would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury suffered. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,34,"Second, Texas invokes the State's sovereign immunity. But the Ex parte Young doctrine allows suits like Reed's for declaratory or injunctive relief against state officers in their official capacities. 209 U.S. 123, 159-161, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,35,"Third, Texas contends that Reed's procedural due process claim contravenes the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See Rooker v.

That doctrine prohibits federal courts from adjudicating cases brought by state-court losing parties challenging state-court judgments. But as this Court explained in Skinner v. Switzer, even though a state-court decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts, a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action. 562 U.S. 521, 532, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d  233 (2011). Here, as in Skinner, Reed does not challenge the adverse state-court decisions themselves, but rather targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute they authoritatively construed. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,37,"This Court's case law severely limits the federal action a state prisoner may bring for DNA testing. Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 525, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011). The Court has rejected the extension of substantive due process to this area, and left slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law denies him procedural due process. Ibid. (citation omitted), see District Attorney's Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 69, 72, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,38,"Seeking to fit his § 1983 suit within the slim room left by this Court's precedent, Reed raised a procedural due process challenge to Texas's post-conviction DNA testing law. The sole question now before this Court is whether Reed's § 1983 suit was timely. The parties agree that the statute of limitations for Reed's claim is two years. But the parties disagree about when that 2-year limitations period began to run. That question is one of federal law. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,39,"As a general matter, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action. Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192, 201, 118 S.Ct. 542, 139 L.Ed.2d 553 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). To determine when a plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action, the Court focuses first on the specific constitutional right alleged to have been infringed. See McDonough v. Smith, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2149, 2155, 204 L.Ed.2d 506 (2019).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,40,"Here, the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed is procedural due process. A procedural due process claim consists of two elements: (i) deprivation by state action of a protected interest in life, liberty, or property, and (ii) inadequate state process. See Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). Importantly, the Court has stated that a procedural due process claim is not complete when the deprivation occurs. Id., at 126, 110 S.Ct. 975. Rather, the claim is complete only when the State fails to provide due process. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,41,"Reed contends that the State's process for considering his DNA testing request was fundamentally unfair in violation of the Due Process Clause. Texas's process for considering a request for DNA testing in capital cases includes not only trial court proceedings, but also appellate review by the Court of Criminal Appeals. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 64.05. And under longstanding Texas rules of appellate procedure, the Court of Criminal Appeals's appellate review process encompasses a motion for rehearing. Tex. Rule App. Proc. 79.1 (2022).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,42,"In Reed's case, the State's alleged failure to provide Reed with a fundamentally fair process was complete when the state litigation ended and deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing. Therefore, Reed's § 1983 claim was complete and the statute of limitations began to run when the state litigation ended—when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Reed's motion for rehearing.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,43,"The soundness of that straightforward conclusion is reinforced by the consequences that would follow from a contrary approach. McDonough, 588 U. S., at ___,  139 S.Ct., at 2158. If the statute of limitations for a § 1983 suit like Reed's began to run after a state trial court's denial of a plaintiff's motion for DNA testing (or even after the appeal before the plaintiff's rehearing proceedings), the plaintiff would likely continue to pursue relief in the state system and simultaneously file a protective federal § 1983 suit challenging that ongoing state process. That parallel litigation would run counter to core principles of federalism, comity, consistency, and judicial economy. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2158. We see no good reason for such senseless duplication.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-005,44,"Moreover, significant systemic benefits ensue from starting the statute of limitations clock when the state litigation in DNA testing cases like Reed's has concluded. If any due process flaws lurk in the DNA testing law, the state appellate process may cure those flaws, thereby rendering a federal § 1983 suit unnecessary. And if the state appellate court construes the DNA testing statute, that construction will streamline and focus subsequent § 1983 proceedings.",Kavanaugh,0,

That afternoon, a passerby discovered Stites' body in a ditch by a country road, her clothing disturbed in a manner suggesting sexual violence. Medical examiners determined that Stites had been strangled to death with her own belt, which was found in two pieces—one near the truck, the other near Stites' body.

Then, about six months after Stites' death, Reed was arrested for kidnaping and attempting to rape and murder another young woman near the route Stites typically took to work and around the same time of night when Stites had gone missing. Reed lived near the high school and was often seen walking the surrounding area at night. Intrigued, the police checked Reed's DNA profile, which Texas had on file from an earlier sexual-assault case against him.

The jury rejected that post hoc narrative and found Reed guilty. In the separate penalty phase, Reed's kidnaping victim testified about how Reed had abducted, threatened, and attempted to rape her before she was fortuitously able to escape. Four other women —and one underage girl—also testified that Reed had brutally beaten and raped them in the past. Reed was sentenced to death.",Thomas,0,

The district attorney consented to test some of the items outside of the Chapter 64 framework, but he otherwise opposed Reed's request. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Reed had not established two necessary elements for Chapter 64 testing: (1) that he would not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing, Art. 64.03(a)(2)(A), and (2) that his Chapter 64 motion was not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.

Third, addressing only the items that survived the previous two holdings, the CCA held that Reed had not established that exculpatory results from DNA testing of those items would have prevented his conviction. See id., at 773-777. Finally, the CCA held that Reed had failed to establish that his Chapter 64 motion was not made for purposes of delay. See id., at 777-780.

III, § 2, cl. 1, constraining judicial power to the determination of real, earnest and vital controversies between contending litigants. Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U.S. 339, 345, 12 S.Ct. 400, 36 L.Ed. 176 (1892). An essential and unchanging part of this case-or-controversy requirement is the doctrine of Article III standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Under that doctrine, any party requesting relief from a federal court must assert an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, and he must show that his injury is both fairly traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling. Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149, 130 S.Ct. 2743, 177 L.Ed.2d 461 (2010), see also Town of Chester v.

On the other hand, the criterion which distinguishes appellate from original jurisdiction, is that it revises and corrects the decisions of another tribunal. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 86, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807), see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 175-176, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). As such, a case or controversy is appellate in nature when the relief-seeking party's injury is traceable to the allegedly erroneous action of another court and requires a remedy correcting that judicial action (e.g., reversal or vacatur of the challenged judgment).3 See, e.g., Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U. S. ___, ___-___, 139 S.Ct. 2356, 204 L.Ed.2d 742 (2019), Monsanto, 561 U.S. at 150-153, 130 S.Ct. 2743. Thus, whenever a party seeks relief from a federal court, the elements that bring his claim within Article III in the first place—the nature and source of his injury and the remedy needed to redress it—also dictate whether his claim invokes original or appellate jurisdiction.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,73,"The conceptual distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction also animates the Rooker-Feldman doctrine— which, despite its name, is not so much a doctrine as a basic fact of federal statutory law. This Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction to review certain state-court judgments by certiorari. 28 U.S.C. § 1257(a). But no other federal court has appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, and, in particular, the jurisdiction possessed by the District Courts is strictly original. Rooker v.

Thus, if the losing party in a state judicial proceeding claims that the state judgment itself violates his federal rights—a claim that calls for an exercise of appellate jurisdiction —his only remedy in the federal system is certiorari in this Court.

See, e.g., App. 14, ¶2, 31-33, ¶¶53-57, 38, ¶69, 39-40, ¶¶71, 74, 41, ¶79, 42-43, ¶¶83-84, 44-45, ¶¶86-87. All of those alleged injuries are traceable to the CCA, not the district attorney. And, redressing them would require an exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the CCA— jurisdiction that the District Court does not have. Confirming the point, Reed's complaint does not ask the District Court to control the district attorney's actions at all. Instead, the only relief it requests is a declaration that the CCA's interpretation and application of Chapter 64  is unconstitutional. Id., at 49. The complaint transparently seeks nothing more than the District Court's review and rejection of the CCA's judgment. Exxon Mobil, 544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517. As such, it founders upon the Rooker-Feldman doctrine as well as the Article III traceability and redressability requirements with which that doctrine is intertwined.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,75,"Any doubt that Reed seeks de facto appellate review should be dispelled by one undisputed fact: Every due process violation that Reed alleges could have been considered on direct review of the CCA's judgment in this Court. After all, determining whether state-court judgments applied unconstitutional constructions of state law is a classic use of this Court's appellate jurisdiction under § 1257(a). See, e.g., Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 453, 121 S.Ct. 1693, 149 L.Ed.2d 697 (2001), Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 349, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964), Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U.S. 673, 678, 50 S.Ct. 451, 74 L.Ed. 1107 (1930). That is why Reed originally petitioned this Court for certiorari to review the CCA's judgment. And it is why he agreed at oral argument that we could have granted that petition. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,76,"Yet, even after repackaging his failed certiorari petition as an original § 1983 complaint, Reed not only concedes but affirmatively argues that his claim is analogous to the due process arguments presented in Rogers, Bouie, and Brinkerhoff-Faris. See Brief for Petitioner 33-34. That he is correct on that front should be fatal to his complaint. Like the petitioners in those cases, Reed contends that the rules of decision applied against him in a state-court proceeding violated his due process rights. Because those contentions would have been appropriate subjects for this Court's appellate review, it follows that Reed cannot press the same due process challenges and seek the same relief in an original action in the District Court. See Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482-486, and n. 15, 103 S.Ct. 1303, accord, id., at, 489, 103 S.Ct. 1303 (Stevens, J., dissenting).",Thomas,0,
2022-005,77,"In holding otherwise, the majority improperly separates the Rooker-Feldman and Article III inquiries and applies a different theory of Reed's claim to each. But, Reed's claim must satisfy two conditions at once: It must implicate an Article III case or controversy between the parties to this action, and that case or controversy must fall within the District Court's strictly original jurisdiction. Rooker, 263 U.S. at 416, 44 S.Ct. 149. The majority articulates no theory of how Reed's claim  can satisfy both conditions. That is because there is no such theory.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,78,"A useful way to view this is to work backwards from the majority's Rooker-Feldman holding. The majority accepts Reed's representation that he does `not challenge the adverse' state-court decisions themselves, but only `targets as unconstitutional the Texas statute Chapter 64 they authoritatively construed.' Ante, at 960-961 (quoting Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 532, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011)). But this workaround to Rooker-Feldman raises a glaring Article III problem: As this Court has repeatedly explained, a federal court may not entertain a free-floating challenge to a statute unmoored from a concrete case or controversy. See, e.g., California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___-___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2114-2116, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021), Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471-472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 360-362, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246 (1911). Unless Reed merely seeks an advisory opinion, his due process challenge to Chapter 64 must seek relief from some concrete enforcement or application of that law that affects him. More specifically, Reed must be challenging either (1) some conduct of the district attorney constituting enforcement of Chapter 64 against him or (2) the CCA's application of Chapter 64 as a rule of decision in his case.4 If it is the former, Reed's suit is original, if it is the latter, it requires an exercise of appellate jurisdiction.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,79,"So, which is it? As already indicated, the correct answer is the latter: Fundamentally, Reed's complaint—like his certiorari petition before it—contests how the Texas courts interpreted, construed, and applied Chapter 64 to deny his motion for DNA testing, App. 14, ¶3, which is why the only relief he requests is an abstract declaration that the CCA's interpretation and application of Chapter 64 is unconstitutional. Id., at 49. The idea that his claim does not challenge the adverse state-court decisions, ante, at 961 (internal quotation marks omitted), cannot survive even a cursory examination of his complaint. See supra, at 966-968.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,80,"Nor would the other possibility make any sense. Reed cannot be seeking relief from the district attorney's enforcement of Chapter 64, because the district attorney has not enforced that law against Reed at all. The sum total of the district attorney's relevant conduct is as follows. First, he  declined to order Reed's desired testing in his executive discretion, independent of Chapter 64. Next, when Reed asked the Texas courts to grant testing under Chapter 64, the district attorney opposed his motion. Finally, after Reed's motion proved unsuccessful, the district attorney continued to decline to order Reed's desired testing. To say that this conduct amounts to enforcing Chapter 64 makes as much sense as saying that a party to a discovery dispute, who defeats a motion to compel, in effect, enforces the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by continuing not to turn over the demanded documents. Again, any due process injury that Chapter 64 has caused Reed is traceable to the CCA's judicial application of that law in his case, not to any executive acts or omissions of the district attorney.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,81,"The majority permits Reed to evade that problem by framing his Article III injury as the mere lack of access to his desired evidence, independent of any alleged due process denial. See ante, at 960. But, if framing Reed's injury that way helps with traceability, it only worsens his redressability problem. Suppose that the District Court accepted Reed's due process arguments and issued his requested relief: an abstract declaration that the interpretation of Chapter 64 that the CCA applied in his case is unconstitutional. How, exactly, would that redress Reed's injury of not having the evidence tested? The CCA's Chapter 64 judgment would remain untouched, Reed would have obtained an opinion disapproving its reasoning, but without any appellate revision and correction to disturb its finality. Bollman, 4 Cranch at 86. Nor would a declaration that the CCA's construction of Chapter 64 was unconstitutional imply anything about the district attorney's duties or liabilities.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,82,"The majority asserts that such a declaration would cause `a significant increase in the likelihood' that the district attorney would grant Reed's desired testing. Ante, at 960 (quoting Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 464, 122 S.Ct. 2191, 153 L.Ed.2d 453 (2002)). But the district attorney has made clear that he does not understand Reed's requested relief to require any change in conduct from him and that it is not likely to bring about such change. Brief for Respondent 38-39. If the majority thinks the district attorney is wrong about that, it would only be fair to explain exactly what change in conduct would be legally required of him if Reed prevailed on his due process claim. The majority fails to do so.5",Thomas,0,
2022-005,83,"Instead, it offers a number of vague pronouncements, all of which wilt under scrutiny. Consider the claim that Reed's victory in this action would eliminate the district attorney's justification for denying DNA testing. Ante, at 960. If this means that Reed's requested relief would entitle him to testing under Chapter 64, it is wrong because the CCA's unreversed judgment would stand as a final, binding determination of Reed's Chapter 64 rights even if the District Court were to declare that, in its opinion, the CCA had applied that law unconstitutionally in Reed's case. Alternatively, if the majority means that the success of Reed's due process claim would require the district attorney to permit  testing in his independent executive discretion, it is also wrong because Reed is not challenging the district attorney's denial of discretionary testing as unlawful— only the CCA's interpretation and application of Chapter 64. App. 49.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,84,"The majority also misses the mark when it asserts that it is substantially likely that the district attorney would abide by Reed's requested court order. Ante, at 960 (internal quotation marks omitted). Again, the only court order Reed seeks is a declaration disapproving the legal underpinnings of the CCA's judgment. Such an order would have no bearing on the district attorney's future conduct, in a literal sense, there would be nothing for him to abide by.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,85,"Finally, the majority says that the District Court `would have ordered a change in a legal status' were it to grant the declaration Reed seeks. Ibid. (quoting Utah, 536 U.S. at 464, 122 S.Ct. 2191). The intended meaning of this statement is completely obscure. The status that the majority has in mind cannot be that of Chapter 64 itself. See California, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2115 (explaining that judicial remedies `operate with respect to specific parties,' not `on legal rules in the abstract'), see also Mellon, 262 U.S. at 488, 43 S.Ct. 597 (explaining that courts have no power per se to review and annul statutes on the ground that they are unconstitutional, only the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment when declaring the law applicable to a justiciable controversy). Nor can the majority mean that the District Court could change the status of the CCA's judgment. In reality, the only way that the District Court could possibly help Reed obtain DNA testing is by directly controlling the district attorney's actions. But, again, Reed's complaint neither requests nor sets forth a basis for any such relief.6",Thomas,0,
2022-005,86,"In sum, there is no getting around the essential problem with Reed's due process claim: To the extent he is not merely seeking an advisory opinion, he is complaining about a court-inflicted injury, and redressing that injury would require an exercise  of appellate jurisdiction that the District Court does not possess. In substance, his complaint in this action is a mere reprise of his prior certiorari petition, camouflaged as an original action against the district attorney. Thus, I would vacate the Fifth Circuit's judgment and remand this case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,88,The majority next holds that Reed's § 1983 due process claim was timely because it did not accrue until the CCA denied rehearing. The little reasoning the majority offers for this conclusion helpfully accentuates its antecedent jurisdictional errors.,Thomas,0,
2022-005,89,"First, the majority points out that a procedural due process claim is not necessarily `complete when the deprivation occurs,' but only when `the State fails to provide due process.' Ante, at 961 (quoting Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 126, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990)). Yet, the general rule is that due process itself requires predeprivation notice and hearing, so the truism for which the majority quotes Zinermon matters only in those extraordinary situations in which we tolerate postdeprivation process as sufficient. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, 53, 114 S.Ct. 492, 126 L.Ed.2d 490 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), see Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 127-130, 110 S.Ct. 975. The majority proceeds to show, however, that it does not regard this case as a postdeprivation case at all, for it says that the State deprived Reed of his asserted liberty interest in DNA testing at the very moment when the State's alleged failure to provide Reed with a fundamentally fair process was complete. Ante, at 961. Given this understanding of Reed's claim, the important proposition with which the majority begins its analysis is doctrinally irrelevant. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,90,"After that red herring, the majority engages in an obvious equivocation, conflating the Chapter 64 process that Reed challenges as fundamentally unfair with the Texas courts' generally applicable decisional procedures. Ibid. But of course, those procedures are not what Reed challenges. Instead (and, again, exactly like the arguments in his prior certiorari petition), his due process claim `targets as unconstitutional' the substantive requirements of Chapter 64 as construed. Ante, at 960-961. His claim plainly would be no different if the CCA did not entertain rehearing motions.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,91,"Still, the majority's confused accrual reasoning is useful for the added light that it shines on Reed's jurisdictional problems. As the majority says, a procedural due process claim has two elements: (1) a deprivation and (2) inadequate process. The majority then acknowledges that the state courts effectuated Reed's deprivation, and it treats the state courts' ordinary decisional mechanics as the allegedly inadequate process. But, after both elements of Reed's claim are thus laid at the feet of the state courts, what role is left for the nominal defendant here, the district attorney? What part did he play in violating Reed's procedural due process rights, and what makes him a proper defendant to Reed's § 1983 claim?",Thomas,0,
2022-005,92,"The majority has no answer. At bottom, its approval of Reed's claim is intelligible only upon the supposition that the district attorney may be sued as a mere stand-in for the State as a whole, such that Reed can urge against him the due process violations that the State allegedly committed through its courts. That is a profound mistake. True, the district attorney and the CCA are both state actors. But, States  act in different ways through their different entities and officers, and the nature of a challenged state action determines what federal-court remedy may be available.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,93,"As this Court has explained, a State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities, and in no other way. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 347, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880). The Due Process Clause applies to action through any of these agencies, ibid., but not every alleged due process violation may be asserted in an original § 1983 action. By itself, a State's legislative enactment of an unconstitutional law does not give rise to a justiciable case or controversy. See California, 593 U. S., at ___-___, 141 S.Ct., at 2114-2116, Muskrat, 219 U.S. at 361, 31 S.Ct. 250. Next, when a State allegedly violates due process through executive action, the aggrieved party may bring an original action for appropriate relief against the relevant executive officer. See Mellon, 262 U.S. at 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).7 And, when a State allegedly violates due process through its judicial actions —be it through the denial of a fundamentally fair judicial procedure or through the application of a rule of decision that itself violates due process—the remedy that Congress has provided is appellate review of the challenged judgment in this Court. Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, see, e.g., Rogers, 532 U.S. at 453, 121 S.Ct. 1693, Bouie, 378 U.S. at 349, 84 S.Ct. 1697, Brinkerhoff-Faris, 281 U.S. at 678, 50 S.Ct. 451, cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U.S. 702, 130 S.Ct. 2592, 177 L.Ed.2d 184 (2010) (reviewing judicial-taking claim on certiorari to the challenged state-court judgment). But, if that remedy proves unsuccessful —as it did for Reed—the aggrieved party cannot simply substitute an executive officer as a defendant, charge the state court's errors to that officer, and seek redress for a court-inflicted injury in a purported original action.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,94,"Properly understood, therefore, Article III, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, and procedural due process principles work in harmony. The majority's piecemeal analysis replaces this natural coherence with chaos. It dilutes Article III's traceability and redressability requirements to the point of irrelevance. It creates a system in which the same state-court actions simultaneously give rise to identical original and appellate claims for relief. See this Court's Rule 13.3 (The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari  runs from the  date of the denial of rehearing by the lower court). It allows Reed to convert his failed certiorari petition into a § 1983 complaint. And, in doing so, it authorizes a proceeding in which the District Court can do nothing except opine on the constitutional merits of a state-court adjudication.* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-005,95,"If there is a mitigating factor to today's decision, it is that the § 1983 action that the Court misguidedly allows to proceed is no barrier to the prompt execution of Reed's lawful sentence. See Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 583-584, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006). Indeed, Reed conceded at oral argument that you do not get a stay of execution just because you brought a Chapter 64 proceeding or just because you're in §1983 proceedings challenging the adequacy of the procedures available to you from the state. Tr. of Oral Arg. 68. Texas is free to take him at his word. But, because the majority undermines vital principles of federal jurisdiction and destabilizes the orderly working of our judicial system, I respectfully dissent.",Thomas,0,
2022-005,96,"Justice ALITO, with whom Justice GORSUCH joins, dissenting.",Alito,0,
2022-005,97,"This case involves a suit brought by petitioner Rodney Reed under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against Bryan Goertz, the District Attorney of Bastrop County, Texas. Reed claims that Goertz violated his due process rights when, based on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' interpretation of the Texas statute that allows post-trial DNA testing under specified circumstances, Article 64 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Goertz continued to deny Reed's request for DNA testing of certain items found near the scene of the murder for which he was convicted 25 years ago.",Alito,0,
2022-005,98,"As the Court notes and the parties agree, the statute of limitations for Reed's claim is two years. Ante, at 960-961, Brief for Petitioner 17, Brief for Respondent 17. Reed filed his complaint on August 8, 2019, and the lower courts held that this was too late. The question before us is when the 2-year statute of limitations began to run, that is in legal parlance, when Reed's claim accrued. As the parties agree, the general rule is that a claim accrues when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action, Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Reed contends that his claim did not accrue until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) denied his petition for rehearing on October 4, 2017, and thus refused to retract the interpretation of Article 64 that the court had unanimously adopted on April 12, 2017. Goertz, on the other hand, argues that Reed's claim accrued no later than the date of the CCA's April 12 decision, and because that date preceded the federal lawsuit by more than two years, Goertz maintains that we should affirm the Fifth Circuit's decision that Reed's complaint was filed too late.",Alito,0,
2022-005,99,"As I will explain, there is room for debate about exactly when Reed's DNA testing claim accrued, but in my view, the notion that this did not take place until rehearing was denied is clearly wrong.",Alito,0,
2022-005,101,"Before getting to the nub of this case, I briefly explain why Reed's claim might have accrued even earlier than April 12, 2017. First, it can be argued that Reed's claim against Goertz accrued on or before July 2014, when Goertz initially refused Reed's testing request.1 The general rule  is that a plaintiff's § 1983 claim against a state official for violating a constitutional right accrues when the alleged violation takes place. See Wallace, 549 U.S. at 384, 127 S.Ct. 1091 (§ 1983 claim normally commences to run from when wrong occurs). And the Court does not disclaim the possibility that a plaintiff could file a § 1983 claim as soon as a state prosecutor denies a DNA testing request. See ante, at 962, and n. 1.",Alito,0,
2022-005,102,"Another possibility is that the particular claim Reed now asserts did not accrue until the state trial court held that Goertz had properly denied Reed's testing request. Reed does not claim that the bare text of Article 64 is unconstitutional. (Had he done so, he could hardly argue, as he does now, that his claim did not accrue until the end of the appellate process.) Instead, he stresses that his claim concerns the state courts' construction of that statute and in particular, their holding that the evidence for which testing is sought must not be contaminated. Brief for Petitioner 3, 15, 29. In response to this argument, Goertz contends that every allegedly unconstitutional aspect of the judicial interpretation of the statute was adopted by the time the state trial court issued amended findings of fact and conclusions of law in 2016, and Goertz therefore takes the position that Reed's unconstitutional-construction claim accrued at that time. Brief for Respondent 18-19.",Alito,0,
2022-005,105,"For present purposes, it is not necessary to decide whether Reed's claim accrued on either of these two dates. We need only decide whether accrual was put off until the CCA denied rehearing, and it is clear to me that this delayed accrual date is wrong.2 As noted, the claim that Reed asserts is not based on the bare text of Article 64, but on what he claims is an erroneous interpretation of that provision by the Texas courts. He thus submits that his claim accrued when the authoritative construction of Article 64 that he challenges was pronounced by the CCA. Brief for Petitioner 17.",Alito,0,
2022-005,106,"I will assume for the sake of argument that Reed's claim accrued when the CCA issued its authoritative construction of Article 64, but I cannot agree with Reed's argument—which the Court conspicuously declines to defend—that the CCA's interpretation did not become authoritative until rehearing was denied.",Alito,0,
2022-005,107,"Reed cites no authority for the proposition that the filing of a petition for rehearing typically suspends the authoritative force of an appellate court's decision, and in fact, it appears that the opposite is true—as this Court's GVR practice illustrates. On or shortly after the day when  we hand down a decision, we often GVR cases in which petitions raising similar issues are pending before us. (That is, we grant the petition, vacate the decision below, and remand the case for reconsideration in light of the decision we have handed down.) On June 30, 2022, for example, we did this in no fewer than 33 cases.3 We do not wait to see if a petition for rehearing will be filed, nor do we hold off until a mandate is issued or a certified copy of the judgment is prepared. See this Court's Rules 45.2 and 45.3. If our decisions did not become authoritative and binding as soon as they are issued, this practice would be impermissible.",Alito,0,
2022-005,108,"There is no reason why decisions of the CCA should be viewed any differently. On the contrary, it appears that the CCA has followed a practice similar to our GVR practice. See Oliver v. State, 872 S.W.2d 713, 716 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (vacating judgment and remanding for reconsideration in light of decision on same day). And neither Reed nor the Court has cited any contrary Texas authority. Accordingly, Reed's authoritative construction argument became complete, at the latest, when the CCA adopted that construction on April 12, 2017, two years and 11 months before Reed filed his § 1983 complaint.",Alito,0,
2022-005,110,"Unlike Reed, the Court does not contend that the CCA's interpretation lacked authoritative status until rehearing was denied. Instead, the Court merely proclaims that the State, acting through Goertz, did not deny Reed due process of law until the state litigation ended. Ante, at 961.4 I certainly see the logic in this view: until the process afforded by a State has been exhausted, it may be said that the State has not definitively denied the process that the Constitution is alleged to demand. This logic leads to the conclusion that a prisoner like Reed should exhaust state remedies—something that would generally be required if the proper vehicle for contesting the denial of a DNA testing claim were a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1). But the Court rejected that proposition in District Attorney's Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009), and it is well-established that a § 1983 plaintiff need not exhaust state remedies. Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496, 500-501, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982), Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 649, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Not only is this the general rule, but the Osborne Court found that the rule applies in cases involving constitutional challenges to the denial of requested DNA testing. 557 U.S. at 71, 129 S.Ct. 2308. Thus, the Court's reasoning collides with precedent.",Alito,0,
2022-005,111,"On top of this, the Court's reasoning, if taken to its logical conclusion, points to a result that neither Reed nor the Court is willing to embrace: namely, that a due process challenge to the denial of a request for DNA testing is not ripe until state remedies have been exhausted. (Reed squarely rejects that conclusion, Brief for Petitioner 48, Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13, and the Court reserves judgment. Ante, at 962,  n. 1.) But that is where the Court's reasoning is likely to lead.",Alito,0,
2022-005,112,"Reed tries to circumvent this problem by distinguishing between a claim that challenges the literal terms of a state law and one that challenges the law as authoritatively interpreted by the State's highest court. Brief for Petitioner 30, 48. On this view, only claims of the latter type would have to proceed through the entire state court appellate process before a § 1983 challenge could be brought. But this categorization of DNA-testing claims is problematic. When a State's high court interprets a state law, it generally settles what the law always meant, and therefore it is hard to see the difference between a claim that the text of a state statute is unconstitutional and a claim that the text is unconstitutional as interpreted by the State's highest court. In the case of a state law like Article 64, which permits DNA testing under limited circumstances, the court may interpret the statute to impose requirements that are not expressly spelled out in the statutory text. (That is what happened here.) Or the state high court may interpret requirements in the text more leniently than a literal reading of the text would demand.

Does it mean that such a plaintiff must exhaust state remedies at the trial level but need not appeal? Does it mean that such a plaintiff must pursue some (but not full) appellate review?

He says that this rule is unfair because he isn't Nostradamus, lacks supernatural foresight, and therefore could not have predicted at the time of the trial court decision whether the CCA would ultimately agree. Brief for Petitioner 26, 32. He argues that his rule promotes federalism (because it encourages resort to state court litigation before turning to the federal courts), judicial economy (because it tends to avoid contemporaneous litigation in both state and federal court), comity (because it allows state courts to adopt interpretations of their statutes that avoid federal constitutional problems), and practical reality (because a prisoner bringing an authoritative-construction claim cannot know in advance how a State's high court will interpret the relevant statute).

One need not have supernatural foresight in order to predict that rehearing is unlikely to be granted.

But, petitioners cautioned, even some farmers who already raise group-housed pigs will have to modify their practices if they wish to comply with Proposition 12. Id., at 208a-209a. Much of pork production today is vertically integrated, too, with farmers selling pigs to large processing firms that turn them into different cuts of meat and distribute the different parts  all over to completely different end users. Id., at 334a-335a. Revising this system to segregate and trace Proposition 12-compliant pork, petitioners alleged, will require certain processing firms to make substantial new capital investments.

Everyone agrees, too, that congressional enactments may preempt conflicting state laws. See Art. VI, cl. 2. But everyone also agrees that we have nothing like that here. Despite the persistent efforts of certain pork producers, Congress has yet to adopt any statute that might displace Proposition 12 or laws regulating pork production in other States. See, e.g., H.

Reading between the Constitution's lines, petitioners observe, this Court has held that the Commerce Clause not only vests Congress with the power to regulate interstate trade, the Clause also contains a further, negative command, one effectively forbidding the enforcement of certain state economic regulations even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179, 115 S.Ct. 1331, 131 L.Ed.2d 261 (1995).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,50,"This view of the Commerce Clause developed gradually. In Gibbons v.

By way of example, he cited inspection laws, quarantine laws, and health laws of every description. Ibid. At the same time, however, Chief Justice Marshall saw great force in the argument that the Commerce Clause might impliedly bar certain types of state economic regulation. Id., at 209, 115 S.Ct. 1331. Decades later, in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, this Court again recognized that the power vested in Congress to regulate interstate commerce leaves the States substantial leeway to adopt their own commercial codes. 12 How. 299, 317-321, 53 U.S. 299, 13 L.Ed. 996 (1852).

In fact, petitioners disavow any discrimination-based claim, conceding that Proposition 12 imposes the same burdens on in-state pork producers that it imposes on out-of-state ones.

They contend that our dormant Commerce Clause cases suggest an additional and almost per se rule forbidding enforcement of state laws that have the practical effect of controlling commerce outside the State, even when those laws do not purposely discriminate against out-of-state economic interests.

2022-006,59,"Start with Baldwin. There, this Court refused to enforce New York laws that barred out-of-state dairy farmers from selling their milk in the State unless the price paid to them matched the minimum price New York law guaranteed in-state producers. Id., at 519, 55 S.Ct. 497. In that way, the challenged laws deliberately robbed out-of-state dairy farmers of the opportunity to charge lower prices in New York thanks to whatever natural competitive advantage they might have enjoyed over in-state dairy farmers—for example, lower cost structures, more productive farming practices, or lusher pasturage. D. Regan, The Supreme Court and State Protectionism: Making Sense of the Dormant Commerce Clause, 84 Mich. L. Rev. 1091, 1248 (1986). The problem with New York's laws was thus a simple one: They plainly discriminated against out-of-staters by erecting an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from without the State. Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U.S. 349, 354, 71 S.Ct. 295, 95 L.Ed. 329 (1951) (discussing Baldwin). Really, the laws operated like a tariff or customs duty. West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 194, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 129 L.Ed.2d 157 (1994), see Baldwin, 294 U.S. at 523, 55 S.Ct. 497 (condemning the challenged laws for seeking to protect New York dairy farmers against competition from without).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,60,"Brown-Forman and Healy differed from Baldwin only in that they involved price-affirmation, rather than price-fixing, statutes.

Once more, the goal was plain: New York sought to force out-of-state distillers to surrender whatever cost advantages they enjoyed against their in-state rivals. Id., at 580, 106 S.Ct. 2080. Once more, the law amounted to simple economic protectionism. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,61,"In Healy, a Connecticut law required out-of-state beer merchants to affirm that their in-state prices were no higher than those they charged in neighboring States. 491 U.S. at 328-330, 109 S.Ct. 2491. Here, too, protectionism took center stage. As  the Court later noted, the essential vice in laws like Connecticut's is that they hoard commerce for the benefit of in-state merchants and discourage consumers from crossing state lines to make their purchases from nearby out-of-state vendors. C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 391-392, 114 S.Ct. 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 399 (1994). Nor did the law in Healy even try to cloak its discriminatory purpose: By its plain terms, the Connecticut affirmation statute applied solely to interstate firms, and in that way clearly discriminated against interstate commerce. 491 U.S. at 340-341, 109 S.Ct. 2491. The Court also worried that, if the Connecticut law stood, each of the border States could enact statutes essentially identical to Connecticut's in retaliation—a result often associated with avowedly protectionist economic policies. Id., at 339-340, 109 S.Ct. 2491.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,63,"Petitioners insist that our reading of these cases misses the forest for the trees.

Brief for Petitioners 19, 23. In Healy, petitioners stress, the Court included language criticizing New York's laws for having the `practical effect' of controlling commerce `occurring wholly outside the boundaries of the State.' Brief for Petitioners 21, 25 (quoting 491 U.S. at 336, 109 S.Ct. 2491). In Brown-Forman, petitioners observe, the Court suggested that whether a state law `is addressed only to in-state sales is irrelevant if the practical effect of the law is to control' out-of-state prices.

2022-006,64,"In our view, however, petitioners read too much into too little. The language of an opinion is not always to be parsed as though we were dealing with language of a statute. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 341, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979). Instead, we emphasize, our opinions dispose of discrete cases and controversies and they must be read with a careful eye to context. See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399-400, 19 U.S. 264, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.). And when it comes to Baldwin, Brown-Forman, and Healy, the language petitioners highlight appeared in a particular context and did particular work. Throughout, the Court explained that the challenged statutes had a specific impermissible extraterritorial effect—they deliberately prevented out-of-state firms from undertaking competitive pricing or deprived businesses and consumers in other States of `whatever competitive advantages they may possess.' Healy, 491 U.S. at 338-339, 109 S.Ct. 2491 (quoting Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580, 106 S.Ct. 2080).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,65,"In recognizing this much, we say nothing new.

2022-006,66,"Consider, too, the strange places petitioners' alternative interpretation could lead. In our interconnected national marketplace, many (maybe most) state laws have the practical effect of controlling extraterritorial behavior. State income tax laws lead some individuals and companies to relocate to other jurisdictions. See, e.g., Banner v. United States, 428 F.3d 303, 310 (C.A. DC 2005) (per curiam). Environmental laws often prove decisive when businesses choose where to manufacture their goods. See American Beverage Assn., 735 F.3d at 379 (Sutton, J., concurring). Add to the extraterritorial-effects list all manner of libel laws, securities requirements, charitable registration requirements, franchise laws, tort laws, and plenty else besides. J. Goldsmith & A. Sykes, The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause, 110 Yale L. J. 785, 804 (2001). Nor, as we have seen, is this a recent development. Since the founding, States have enacted an immense mass of inspection laws, quarantine laws, and health laws of every description that have a considerable influence on commerce outside their borders. Gibbons, 9 Wheat. at 203, see also Cooley, 12 How. at 317-321. Petitioners' almost per se rule against laws that have the practical effect of controlling extraterritorial commerce would cast a shadow over laws long understood to represent valid exercises of the States' constitutionally reserved powers. It would provide neither courts nor litigants with meaningful guidance in how to resolve disputes over them. Instead, it would invite endless litigation and inconsistent results.

Doubtless, too, courts must sometimes referee disputes about where one State's authority ends and another's begins—both inside and outside the commercial context. In carrying out that task, this Court has recognized the usual legislative power of a State to act upon persons and property within the limits of its own territory, Hoyt v. Sprague, 103 U.S. 613, 630, 26 L.Ed. 585 (1881), a feature of our constitutional order that allows different communities to live with different local standards, Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). But, by way of example, no one should think that one State may adopt a law exempting securities held by the residents of a second State from taxation in that second State. Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U.S. 592, 592-594, 26 L.Ed. 845 (1882). Nor, we have held, should anyone think one State may prosecute the citizen of another State for acts committed outside the first State's jurisdiction that are not intended to produce or that do not produce detrimental effects within it. Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 285, 31 S.Ct. 558, 55 L.Ed. 735 (1911).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,68,"To resolve disputes about the reach of one State's power, this Court has long consulted original and historical understandings of the Constitution's structure and the principles of sovereignty and comity it embraces. BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 572, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). This Court has invoked as well a number of the Constitution's express provisions—including the Due Process Clause and the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 818, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985). The  antidiscrimination principle found in our dormant Commerce Clause cases may well represent one more effort to mediate competing claims of sovereign authority under our horizontal separation of powers. But none of this means, as petitioners suppose, that any question about the ability of a State to project its power extraterritorially must yield to an almost per se rule under the dormant Commerce Clause. This Court has never before claimed so much ground for judicial supremacy under the banner of the dormant Commerce Clause. United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.S. 330, 347, 127 S.Ct. 1786, 167 L.Ed.2d 655 (2007). We see no reason to change course now.1",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,70,"Failing in their first theory, petitioners retreat to a second they associate with Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). Under Pike, they say, a court must at least assess `the burden imposed on interstate commerce' by a state law and prevent its enforcement if the law's burdens are `clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.' Brief for Petitioners 44. Petitioners then rattle off a litany of reasons why they believe the benefits Proposition 12 secures for Californians do not outweigh the costs it imposes on out-of-state economic interests. We see problems with this theory too.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,72,"In the first place, petitioners overstate the extent to which Pike and its progeny depart from the antidiscrimination rule that lies at the core of our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. As this Court has previously explained, no clear line separates the Pike line of cases from our core antidiscrimination precedents. General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 298, n. 12, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997). While many of our dormant Commerce Clause cases have asked whether a law exhibits `facial discrimination,' several cases that have purported to apply Pike, including Pike itself, have turned in whole or in part on the discriminatory character of the challenged state regulations. Ibid. In other words, if some of our cases focus on whether a state law discriminates on its face, the Pike line serves as an important reminder that a law's practical effects may also disclose the presence of a discriminatory purpose.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,73,"Pike itself illustrates the point. That case concerned an Arizona order requiring cantaloupes grown in state to be processed and packed in state. 397 U.S. at 138-140, 90 S.Ct. 844. The Court held that Arizona's order violated the dormant Commerce Clause. Id., at 146, 90 S.Ct. 844. Even if that order could be fairly characterized as facially neutral, the Court stressed that it required business operations to be performed in state that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere. Id., at 145, 90 S.Ct. 844. The practical effects of the order in operation thus revealed a discriminatory purpose—an effort to insulate instate processing and packaging businesses from out-of-state competition. Id., at 140, 145, 90 S.Ct. 844.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,74,"Other cases in the Pike line underscore the same message. In Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., the Court found no impermissible burden on interstate commerce because, looking to the law's effects, there was no reason to suspect that the gainers would be in-state firms or that the losers would be out-of-state firms. 449 U.S. 456, 473, 101 S.Ct. 715, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981), see also id., at 474-477, and n. 2, 101 S.Ct. 715 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (asking whether the actual purpose, if not the `avowed purpose,' of the law was discrimination). Similarly, in Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, the Court keyed to the fact that the effect of the challenged law was only to shift business from one set of out-of-state suppliers to another. 437 U.S. 117, 127, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978). And in United Haulers, a plurality upheld the challenged law because it could not detect any discrimination in favor of in-state businesses or against out-of-state competitors. 550 U.S. at 346, 127 S.Ct. 1786. In each of these cases and many more, the presence or absence of discrimination in practice proved decisive.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,75,"Once again, we say nothing new here. Some time ago, Tracy identified the congruity between our core dormant Commerce Clause precedents and the Pike line. 519 U.S. at 298, n. 12, 117 S.Ct. 811. Many lower courts have done the same. See, e.g., Rosenblatt v. Santa Monica, 940 F.3d 439, 452 (C.A.9 2019), Park Pet Shop, Inc. v. Chicago, 872 F.3d 495, 501 (C.A.7 2017), Amanda Acquisition Corp. v. Universal Foods Corp., 877 F.2d 496, 505 (C.A.7 1989). So have many scholars. See, e.g., R.

2022-006,76,"Nor does any of this help petitioners in this case. They not only disavow any claim that Proposition 12 discriminates on its face. They nowhere suggest that an examination of Proposition 12's practical effects in operation would disclose purposeful discrimination against out-of-state businesses. While this Court has left the courtroom door open to challenges premised on even nondiscriminatory burdens, Davis, 553 U.S., at 353, 128 S.Ct. 1801, and while a small number of our cases have invalidated state laws  that appear to have been genuinely nondiscriminatory, Tracy, 519 U.S., at 298, n. 12, 117 S.Ct. 811,2  petitioners' claim falls well outside Pike's heartland. That is not an auspicious start.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,78,"Matters do not improve from there. While Pike has traditionally served as another way to test for purposeful discrimination against out-of-state economic interests, and while some of our cases associated with that line have expressed special concern with certain state regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate transportation, see n. 2, supra, petitioners would have us retool Pike for a much more ambitious project. They urge us to read Pike as authorizing judges to strike down duly enacted state laws regulating the in-state sale of ordinary consumer goods (like pork) based on nothing more than their own assessment of the relevant law's costs and benefits.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,79,"That we can hardly do. Whatever other judicial authorities the Commerce Clause may imply, that kind of freewheeling power is not among them. Petitioners point to nothing in the Constitution's text or history that supports such a project. And our cases have expressly cautioned against judges using the dormant Commerce Clause as a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake. United Haulers, 550 U.S., at 343, 127 S.Ct. 1786. While there was a time when this Court presumed to make such binding judgments for society, under the guise of interpreting the Due Process Clause, we have long refused pleas like petitioners' to reclaim that ground in the name of the dormant Commerce Clause.

2022-006,80,"Not only is the task petitioners propose one the Commerce Clause does not authorize judges to undertake.

Davis, 553 U.S., at 353, 128 S.Ct. 1801.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,81,"Our case illustrates the problem. On the cost side of the ledger, petitioners allege they will face increased production expenses because of Proposition 12. On the benefits side, petitioners acknowledge that Californians voted for Proposition 12 to vindicate a variety of interests, many noneconomic. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 192a (alleging in their complaint that Proposition 12's requirements were driven by a conception of what qualifies as `cruel' animal housing and by the State's concern for the `health and safety of California consumers'). How is a court supposed to compare or weigh economic costs (to some) against noneconomic benefits (to others)? No neutral legal rule guides the way. The competing goods before us are  insusceptible to resolution by reference to any juridical principle. Really, the task is like being asked to decide whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy. Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U.S. 888, 897, 108 S.Ct. 2218, 100 L.Ed.2d 896 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,82,"Faced with this problem, petitioners reply that we should heavily discount the benefits of Proposition 12. They say that California has little interest in protecting the welfare of animals raised elsewhere and the law's health benefits are overblown. But along the way, petitioners offer notable concessions too. They acknowledge that States may sometimes ban the in-state sale of products they deem unethical or immoral without regard to where those products are made (for example, goods manufactured with child labor). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (A state is perfectly entitled to enforce its morals in state), see also Western Union Telegraph Co. v. James, 162 U.S. 650, 653, 16 S.Ct. 934, 40 L.Ed. 1105 (1896) (holding that States may enact laws to promote  public morals). And, at least arguably, Proposition 12 works in just this way—banning from the State all whole pork products derived from practices its voters consider cruel. Petitioners also concede that States may often adopt laws addressing even imperfectly understood health risks associated with goods sold within their borders. Reply Brief 13. And, again, no one disputes that some who voted for Proposition 12 may have done so with just that sort of goal in mind. See, e.g., USDA Proposed Rule To Amend Organic Livestock and Poultry Production Requirements, 87 Fed. Reg. 48565 (2022) (affording animals more space may result in healthier livestock products for human consumption).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,83,"So even accepting everything petitioners say, we remain left with a task no court is equipped to undertake. On the one hand, some out-of-state producers who choose to comply with Proposition 12 may incur new costs. On the other hand, the law serves moral and health interests of some (disputable) magnitude for in-state residents. Some might reasonably find one set of concerns more compelling. Others might fairly disagree. How should we settle that dispute? The competing goods are incommensurable. Your guess is as good as ours.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,84,"More accurately, your guess is better than ours. In a functioning democracy, policy choices like these usually belong to the people and their elected representatives.

Under the (wakeful) Commerce Clause, that body enjoys the power to adopt federal legislation that may preempt conflicting state  laws. That body is better equipped than this Court to identify and assess all the pertinent economic and political interests at play across the country. And that body is certainly better positioned to claim democratic support for any policy choice it may make. But so far, Congress has declined the producers' sustained entreaties for new legislation. See Part I, supra (citing failed efforts).

2022-006,88,"To appreciate petitioners' problem, compare our case to Exxon. That case involved a Maryland law prohibiting petroleum producers from operating retail gas stations in the State. 437 U.S. at 119-121, and n. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2207. Because Maryland had no in-state petroleum producers, Exxon argued, the law's divestiture requirements fell solely on interstate companies and threatened to force some to withdraw entirely from the Maryland market or incur new costs to serve that market. Id., at 125-127, 98 S.Ct. 2207. All this, the company said, amounted to a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,89,"This Court found the allegations in Exxon's complaint insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate a substantial burden on interstate commerce. Without question, Maryland's law favored one business structure (independent gas station retailers) over another (vertically integrated production and retail firms). Ibid. The law also promised to increase retail gas prices for Maryland consumers, allowing some to question its wisdom. Id., at 124, 128, 98 S.Ct. 2207. But, the Court found, Exxon failed to plead facts leading, either logically or as a practical matter, to the conclusion that the State was discriminating against interstate commerce. Id., at 125, 98 S.Ct. 2207. The company failed to do so because, on its face, Maryland's law welcomed competition from interstate retail gas station chains that did not produce petroleum. Id., at 125-126, 98 S.Ct. 2207. And as far as anyone could tell, the law's practical effect wasn't to protect in-state producers, it was to shift market share from one set of out-of-state firms (vertically integrated businesses) to another (retail gas station firms). Id., at 125, 127, 98 S.Ct. 2207. This Court squarely rejected the view that this predicted `change in the market structure' would impermissibly burden interstate commerce. Id., at 127, 98 S.Ct. 2207. If the dormant Commerce Clause protects the interstate market  from prohibitive or burdensome regulations, the Court held, it does not protect particular  firms or particular structures or methods of operation. Id., at 127-128, 98 S.Ct. 2207.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,90,"If Maryland's law did not impose a sufficient burden on interstate commerce to warrant further scrutiny, the same must be said for Proposition 12. In Exxon, vertically integrated businesses faced a choice: They could divest their production capacities or withdraw from the local retail market. Here, farmers and vertically integrated processors have at least as much choice: They may provide all their pigs the space the law requires, they may segregate their  operations to ensure pork products entering California meet its standards, or they may withdraw from that State's market. In Exxon, the law posed a choice only for out-of-state firms. Here, the law presents a choice primarily—but not exclusively—for out-of-state businesses, California does have some pork producers affected by Proposition 12. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 205a. In Exxon, as far as anyone could tell, the law threatened only to shift market share from one set of out-of-state firms to another. Here, the pleadings allow for the same possibility—that California market share previously enjoyed by one group of profit-seeking, out-of-state businesses (farmers who stringently confine pigs and processors who decline to segregate their products) will be replaced by another (those who raise and trace Proposition 12-compliant pork). In both cases, some may question the wisdom of a law that threatens to disrupt the existing practices of some industry participants and may lead to higher consumer prices. 437 U.S. at 128, 98 S.Ct. 2207. But the dormant Commerce Clause does not protect a particular structure or method of operation. Id., at 127, 98 S.Ct. 2207. That goes for pigs no less than gas stations.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,91,"Think of it another way. Petitioners must plead facts plausibly suggesting a substantial harm to interstate commerce, facts that render that outcome a speculative possibility are not enough. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). In an effort to meet this standard, petitioners allege facts suggesting that certain out-of-state farmers and processing firms will find it difficult to comply with Proposition 12 and may choose not to do so. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 198a, 208a, 313a. But the complaint also acknowledges that many producers have already converted to some form of group housing, even if they have not all yet met Proposition 12's standards. Id., at 186a. From these facts, the complaint plausibly alleges that some out-of-state firms may face difficulty complying (or may choose not to comply) with Proposition 12.

2022-006,92,"Of course, as the complaint alleges, a shift from one set of production methods to another promises some costs. Id., at 214a. But the complaint concedes that complying producers will be able to pass along at least some of their increased costs to consumers. Id., at 178a. And no one thinks that costs ultimately borne by in-state consumers thanks to a law they adopted counts as a cognizable harm under our dormant Commerce Clause precedents. See United Haulers, 550 U.S., at  345, 127 S.Ct. 1786 (holding that the dormant Commerce Clause is not offended by higher prices likely to fall upon the very people who voted for the challenged law). Nor does the complaint allege facts plausibly suggesting that out-of-state consumers indifferent to pork production methods will have to pick up the tab (let alone explain how petitioners might sue to vindicate their interests). Instead, at least one declaration incorporated by reference into the complaint avers that some out-of-state consumers will not value these changes and will not pay an increased price. App. to Pet. for Cert. 335a, see also Brief for Agricultural and Resource Economics Professors as Amici Curiae 15, 23 (suggesting negligible effect on out-of-state prices for consumers not interested in Proposition 12-compliant pork). Further experience may yield further facts. But the facts pleaded in this complaint merely allege harm to some producers' favored methods of operation. Exxon, 437 U.S., at 127, 98 S.Ct. 2207. A substantial harm to interstate commerce remains nothing more than a speculative possibility. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,94,"THE CHIEF JUSTICE's concurrence in part and dissent in part (call it the lead dissent) offers a contrasting view. Correctly, it begins by rejecting petitioners' almost per se rule against laws with extraterritorial effects. Post, at 1167. And correctly, it disapproves reading Pike to endorse a freewheeling judicial weighing of benefits and burdens. Post, at 1167-1168. But for all it gets right, in other respects it goes astray. In places, the lead dissent seems to advance a reading of Pike that would permit judges to enjoin the enforcement of any state law restricting the sale of an ordinary consumer good if the law threatens an `excessive' harm to the interstate market for that good. Post, at 1168-1172. It is an approach that would go much further than our precedents permit.

2022-006,95,"Consider an example. Today, many States prohibit the sale of horsemeat for human consumption. See Cavel Int'l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 551, 552-555 (C.A.7 2007). But these prohibitions harm the interstate market for horsemeat by denying outlets for its sale. Not only that, they distort the market for animal products more generally by pressuring horsemeat manufacturers to transition to different products, ones they can lawfully sell nationwide. Under the lead dissent's test, all it would take is one complaint from an unhappy out-of-state producer and—presto—the Constitution would protect the sale of horsemeat. Just find a judge anywhere in the country who considers the burden to producers excessive. Post, at 1171-1172. The same would go for all manner of consumer products currently banned by some States but not by others—goods ranging from fireworks, see, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 148, § 39 (2020), to single-use plastic grocery bags, see, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 38, §§ 1611(2)(A), (4) (2022). Rather than respecting federalism, a rule like that would require any consumer good available for sale in one State to be made available in every State. In the process, it would essentially replicate under Pike's banner petitioners' almost per se rule against state laws with extraterritorial effects.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,96,"Seeking a way around that problem, the lead dissent stumbles into another. It suggests that the burdens of Proposition 12 are particularly substantial because California's law carries implications for producers as far flung as Indiana and North Carolina. Post, at 1170. Why is that so? Justice KAVANAUGH's solo concurrence in part and dissent in part says the quiet  part aloud: California's market is so lucrative that almost any in-state measure will influence how out-of-state profit-maximizing firms choose to operate. Post, at 1173-1174. But if that makes all the difference, it means voters in States with smaller markets are constitutionally entitled to greater authority to regulate in-state sales than voters in States with larger markets. So much for the Constitution's fundamental principle of equal sovereignty among the States. Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 544, 133 S.Ct. 2612, 186 L.Ed.2d 651 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-006,97,"The most striking feature of both dissents, however, may be another one. They suggest that, in assessing a state law's burdens under Pike, courts should take into account not just economic harms but also all manner of derivative harms to out-of-state interests. Post, at 1169-1170 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). These include social costs that are difficult to quantify such as (in this case) costs to the national pig population, animal husbandry traditions, and (again) industry practice.

Instead, petitioners invite us to endorse two new theories of implied judicial power. They would have us recognize an almost per se rule against the enforcement of state laws that have extraterritorial effects—even though this Court has recognized since Gibbons that virtually all state laws create ripple effects beyond their borders. Alternatively, they would have us prevent a State from regulating the sale of an ordinary consumer good within its own borders on nondiscriminatory terms—even though the Pike line of cases they invoke has never before yielded such a result.

Where a statute regulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. Id., at 142, 90 S.Ct. 844.

The Ninth Circuit reasoned that for dormant Commerce Clause purposes, laws that increase compliance costs, without more, do not constitute a significant burden on interstate commerce. 6 F.4th at 1032. The panel then dismissed petitioners' claim under Pike by concluding that the complaint alleged only an increase in compliance costs due to Proposition 12. 6 F.4th at 1033. But, as I read it, the complaint alleges more than simply an increase in compliance costs, unless such costs are defined to include all the fallout from a challenged regulatory regime. Petitioners identify broader, market-wide consequences of compliance—economic harms that our precedents have recognized can amount to a burden on interstate commerce. I would therefore find that petitioners have stated a substantial burden against interstate commerce, vacate the judgment below, and remand this case for the Ninth Circuit to consider whether petitioners have plausibly claimed that the burden alleged outweighs any putative local interests under Pike. 397 U.S., at 142, 90 S.Ct. 844.",Barrett,0,

Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520, 79 S.Ct. 962, 3 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1959), illustrates the point. In that case, we considered an Illinois law requiring that trucks and trailers use a particular kind of mudguard. The cost of installing the mudguards was $30 or more per vehicle, amounting to $4,500 to $45,840 for the trucking companies at issue. Id., at 525, 79 S.Ct. 962. But beyond documenting those direct costs of complying with the Illinois law, we also noted other derivative harms flowing from the regulation. The mudguard rule threatened significant delay in an operation where prompt movement may be of the essence. Id., at 527, 79 S.Ct. 962. Also, changing mudguard types when crossing into Illinois from a State with a different standard would require two to four hours of labor and could prove exceedingly dangerous. Ibid. We concluded that cost taken into consideration together with those other factors could constitute a burden on interstate commerce. Id., at 526, 79 S.Ct. 962 (emphasis added). Subsequent cases followed Bibb's logic by analyzing economic impact to the interstate market separately from immediate costs of compliance. See Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U.S. 662, 674, 101 S.Ct. 1309, 67 L.Ed.2d 580 (1981) (plurality opinion) (separating increased costs from the fact that the challenged law may aggravate  the problem of highway accidents in describing the burden on interstate commerce), Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429, 445, and n. 21, 98 S.Ct. 787, 54 L.Ed.2d 664 (1978) (analyzing an increase in cost independently of other consequential effects, such as slowing the movement of goods).",Barrett,0,

As discussed above, we have applied Pike to state laws that neither concerned transportation nor discriminated against commerce. See Edgar, 457 U.S., at 643-646, 102 S.Ct. 2629. The Pike balance may well come out differently when it comes to interstate transportation, an area presenting a strong interest in national uniformity. Tracy, 519 U.S., at 298, n. 12, 117 S.Ct. 811.

With respect to compliance costs, petitioners allege that Proposition 12 demands significant capital expenditures for farmers who wish to sell into California. Producers will need to spend between $290 and $348 million of additional capital in order to reconstruct their sow housing and overcome the productivity loss that Proposition 12 imposes.

Id., at 213a, id., at 239a. Proposition 12 may not expressly regulate farmers operating out of State. But due to the nature of the national pork market, California has enacted rules that carry implications for producers as far flung as Indiana and North Carolina, whether or not they sell in California.

As the majority explains, only a plurality of the Court in Edgar concluded that the Illinois statute constituted a per se violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. See ante, at 1157, n. 1. But a majority in Edgar analyzed those same extraterritorial effects under our approach in Pike, concluding that the nationwide reach of Illinois's law constituted an obvious burden  on interstate commerce. 457 U.S. at 643, 102 S.Ct. 2629. The Ninth Circuit did not consider whether, by effectively requiring compliance by farmers who do not even wish to ship their product into California, Proposition 12 has a nationwide reach similar to the regulation at issue in Edgar.",Barrett,0,

Because of Proposition 12's square footage requirements, farms will be compelled to adopt group housing, which is likely to produce worse health outcomes and spread pathogens and disease. App. to Pet. for Cert. 229a. Such housing changes will also upend generations of animal husbandry, training, and knowledge. Id., at 211a. And by preventing the use of breeding stalls during the 30 to 40 day period between weaning and confirmation of pregnancy, Proposition 12 puts sows at greater risk of injury and stress during the vulnerable stages of breeding and gestation.

2022-006,136,"Writing for a plurality of the Court, Justice GORSUCH relies on this Court's decision in Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978), to conclude that petitioners' complaint does not plead a substantial burden against interstate commerce. See ante, at 1160-1163, see also ante, at 1166 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (also relying on Exxon). In Exxon, petroleum producers sued after Maryland prohibited their sale of retail gas within the State. 437 U.S. at 119, 98 S.Ct. 2207. The Court concluded that interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes some businesses to shift from one interstate supplier to another. Id., at 127, 98 S.Ct. 2207. Fair enough. But the complaint before us pleads facts going far beyond the allegations in Exxon. The producers in Exxon operated within Maryland and wished to continue doing so. By contrast, petitioners here allege that Proposition 12 will force compliance on farmers who do not wish to sell into the California market, exacerbate health issues in the national pig population, and undercut established operational practices. In my view, these allegations amount to economic harms against the interstate market—not just particular interstate firms, ibid.—such that they constitute a substantial burden under Pike. At the very least, the harms alleged by petitioners are categorically different from the cost of installing $30 mudguards, Bibb, 359 U.S., at 525, 79 S.Ct. 962, or of constructing a $200,000 cantaloupe packing facility, Pike, 397 U.S., at 140, 90 S.Ct. 844.",Barrett,0,

And even then, we only invalidate a regulation if that burden proves clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. Pike, 397 U.S., at 142, 90 S.Ct. 844.

They did so in order to, among other things, create a national economic market and overcome state restrictions on free trade—and thereby promote the general welfare. By the summer of 1787, when the delegates met in Philadelphia, state interference with interstate commerce was cutting off the lifeblood of the Nation. See Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Assn. v. Thomas, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2449, 2459-2460, 204 L.Ed.2d 801 (2019). For the delegates, therefore, removing state trade barriers was a principal reason for the adoption of the Constitution. Ibid. In the state ratifying conventions, moreover, fostering free trade among the States was prominently cited as a reason for ratification. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2460.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,147,The Constitution crafted by the Framers contains several provisions protecting free trade among the States. The Constitution's protection of free trade among the States has resulted in an extraordinary 234-year record of progress: It has facilitated robust economic activity within the United States and has helped generate remarkable (albeit at times uneven) economic prosperity and growth in America relative to the other nations of the world.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,148,"This case involves the American pork industry, which today is a $20 billion-plus industry that generates hundreds of thousands of American jobs and serves millions of American consumers. Importantly for this case, the vast majority of pig farms are located in States other than California—such as Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and North Carolina. And the vast majority of pork is likewise produced in States other than California.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,149,"In 2018, California voters nonetheless passed a ballot initiative, Proposition 12, that not only regulates pig farming and pork production in California, but also in effect regulates pig farming and pork production throughout the United States. Under Proposition 12, all pork sold to consumers in California must be derived from pigs raised in compliance with California's strict standards for pig farming, including California's minimum square footage of space required for housing individual pigs. By its terms, Proposition 12 applies to pigs raised and pork produced outside California.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,150,"California's requirements for pig farms and pork production depart significantly from common agricultural practices that are lawful in major pig-farming and pork-producing States such as Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and North Carolina. See Brief for Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 24-32. Moreover, according to various amici, some of the scientific literature suggests that California's requirements could worsen animal health and welfare. See, e.g., Brief for American Association of Swine Veterinarians as Amicus Curiae 4-19, Brief for State Pork Producers Association of Iowa et al. as Amici Curiae 25-34. Regardless of whether the amici are correct on that point, it is evident that absent California's Proposition 12, relatively few pig farmers and pork producers in the United States would follow the practices that California now demands. Yet American pig farmers and pork producers have little choice but to comply with California's regulatory dictates. It would be prohibitively expensive and practically all but impossible for pig farmers and pork producers to segregate individual pigs based on their ultimate marketplace destination in California or elsewhere. And California's 13-percent share of the consumer pork market makes it economically infeasible for many pig farmers and pork producers to exit the California market.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,151,"California's required changes to pig-farming and pork-production practices  throughout the United States will cost American farmers and pork producers hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars. And those costs for pig farmers and pork producers will be passed on, in many cases, to American consumers of pork via higher pork prices nationwide. The increased costs may also result in lower wages and reduced benefits (or layoffs) for the American workers who work on pig farms and in meatpacking plants. See generally Brief for Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 29-32, Brief for North Carolina Chamber Legal Institute et al. as Amici Curiae 9-13.2",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,152,"In short, through Proposition 12, California is forcing massive changes to pig-farming and pork-production practices throughout the United States. Proposition 12 therefore substantially burdens the interstate pork market. See ante, at 1170-1172 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,153,"Under the Constitution, Congress could enact a national law imposing minimum space requirements or other regulations on pig farms involved in the interstate pork market. In the absence of action by Congress, each State may of course adopt health and safety regulations for products sold in that State. And each State may regulate as it sees fit with respect to farming, manufacturing, and production practices in that State. Through Proposition 12, however, California has tried something quite different and unusual. It has attempted, in essence, to unilaterally impose its moral and policy preferences for pig farming and pork production on the rest of the Nation. It has sought to deny market access to out-of-state pork producers unless their farming and production practices in those other States comply with California's dictates. The State has aggressively propounded a California knows best economic philosophy—where California in effect seeks to regulate pig farming and pork production in all of the United States. California's approach undermines federalism and the authority of individual States by forcing individuals and businesses in one State to conduct their farming, manufacturing, and production practices in a manner required by the laws of a different State.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,154,"Notably, future state laws of this kind might not be confined to the pork industry. As the amici brief of 26 States points out, what if a state law prohibits the sale of fruit picked by noncitizens who are unlawfully in the country? Brief for Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 33. What if a state law prohibits the sale of goods produced by workers paid less than $20 per hour? Or as those States suggest, what if a state law prohibits the retail sale of goods from producers that do not pay for employees' birth control or abortions (or alternatively, that do pay for employees' birth control or abortions)?

California's law thus may foreshadow a new era where States shutter their markets to goods produced in a way that offends their moral or policy preferences—and in doing so, effectively force other States to regulate in accordance with those idiosyncratic state demands.

2022-006,158,"First, the Import-Export Clause prohibits any State, absent the Consent of the Congress, from imposing any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws. Art. I, § 10, cl. 2. This Court has limited that Clause to imports from foreign countries. See Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 133-136, 75 U.S. 123, 19 L.Ed. 382 (1869). As Justice Scalia and Justice THOMAS have explained, that limitation may be mistaken as a matter of constitutional text and history: Properly interpreted, the Import-Export Clause may also prevent States from imposing certain especially burdensome taxes and duties on imports from other States—not just on imports from foreign countries. Comptroller of Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 575 U.S. 542, 573, 135 S.Ct. 1787, 191 L.Ed.2d 813 (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting), see also Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v.

2022-006,159,"In other words, if one State conditions sale of a good on the use of preferred farming, manufacturing, or production practices in another State where the good was grown or made, serious questions may arise under the Import-Export Clause. I do not take a position here on whether such an argument ultimately would prevail. I note only that the question warrants additional consideration in a future case.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,160,"Second, the Privileges and Immunities Clause provides that the Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. Art.

Eule, Laying the Dormant Commerce Clause To Rest, 91 Yale L. J. 425, 446-448 (1982). Under this Court's precedents, one State's efforts to effectively regulate farming, manufacturing, or production in other States could raise significant questions under that Clause. Again, I express no view on whether such an argument ultimately would prevail. But the issue warrants further analysis in a future case.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-006,161,"Third, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires each State to afford Full Faith and Credit to the public Acts of every other State. Art. IV, § 1. That Clause prevents States from adopting any policy  of hostility to the public Acts of another State. Carroll v. Lanza, 349 U.S. 408, 413, 75 S.Ct. 804, 99 L.Ed. 1183 (1955). A State's effort to regulate farming, manufacturing, and production practices in another State (in a manner different from how that other State's laws regulate those practices) could in some circumstances raise questions under that Clause. See, e.g., M. Rosen, State Extraterritorial Powers Reconsidered, 85 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1133, 1153 (2010) (The Full Faith and Credit Clause is the more natural source for limitations on state extraterritorial powers because that clause at its core is concerned with extraterritoriality), see also D.

See ante, at 1160-1163 (plurality opinion), ante, at 1165-1166 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). It appears, therefore, that properly pled dormant Commerce Clause challenges under Pike to laws like California's Proposition 12 (or even to Proposition 12 itself) could succeed in the future—or at least survive past the motion-to-dismiss stage.

In this Court, the sole question presented is whether the first fair use factor, the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes, § 107(1), weighs in favor of AWF's recent commercial licensing to Condé Nast.

The court considered the four fair use factors enumerated in 17 U.S.C. § 107 and held that the Prince Series works made fair use of Goldsmith's photograph. As to the first factor, the works were transformative because, looking at them and the photograph side-by-side, they have a different character, give Goldsmith's photograph a new expression, and employ new aesthetics with creative and communicative results distinct from Goldsmith's. 382 F.Supp.3d at 325-326 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). In particular, the works can reasonably be perceived to have transformed Prince from a vulnerable, uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life figure, such that each Prince Series work is immediately recognizable as a `Warhol' rather than as a photograph of Prince. Id., at 326. Although the second factor, the nature of Goldsmith's copyrighted work (creative and unpublished), would ordinarily weigh in her favor , this factor was of limited importance because the Prince Series works are transformative. Id., at 327. The third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work, favored AWF because, according to the District Court, Warhol removed nearly all the photograph's protectible elements in creating the Prince Series. Id., at 330. Finally, the fourth factor likewise favored AWF because the Prince Series works are not market substitutes that have harmed—or have the potential to harm— Goldsmith. Id., at 331.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,54,"The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. 11 F.4th 26, 54 (2021). It held that all four fair use factors favored Goldsmith. On the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, § 107(1), the Court of Appeals rejected the notion that any secondary work that adds a new aesthetic or new expression to its source material is necessarily transformative. Id., at 38-39. The question was, instead, whether the secondary work's use of its source material is in service of a fundamentally different and  new artistic purpose and character. Id., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such transformative purpose and character must, at bare minimum, comprise something more than the imposition of another artist's style on the primary work. Ibid. Here, however, the overarching purpose and function of the two works at issue is identical, not merely in the broad sense that they are created as works of visual art, but also in the narrow but essential sense that they are portraits of the same person. Ibid. (footnote omitted). The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court's logic that `each Prince Series work' is transformative because it `is immediately recognizable as a Warhol,' which the Court of Appeals believed would create a celebrity-plagiarist privilege. Id., at 43, see also ibid. (The fact that Martin Scorsese's recent film The Irishman is recognizably `a Scorsese' does not absolve him of the obligation to license the original book (some internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,55,"On the other three factors, the Court of Appeals found that the creative and unpublished nature of Goldsmith's photograph favored her, id., at 45, that the amount and substantiality of the portion taken (here, the `essence' of the photograph) was not reasonable in relation to the purpose of the use, id., at 45-47, and that AWF's commercial licensing encroached on Goldsmith's protected market to license her photograph to publications for editorial purposes and to other artists to create derivative works, id., at 48-51.3 The court noted that there was no material dispute that both Goldsmith and AWF have sought to license (and indeed have successfully licensed) their respective depictions of Prince to popular print magazines to accompany articles about him. Id., at 49 (footnote omitted).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,56,"Finally, although the District Court had not reached the issue, the Court of Appeals rejected AWF's argument that the Prince Series works were not substantially similar to Goldsmith's photograph. See id., at 52-54.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,57,"Judge Jacobs concurred. He stressed that the Court of Appeals' holding did not consider, let alone decide, whether the infringement here encumbers the original Prince Series works.

2022-007,61,"Although the Court of Appeals analyzed each fair use factor, the only question before this Court is whether the court below correctly held that the first factor, the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes,  § 107(1), weighs in Goldsmith's favor. AWF contends that the Prince Series works are transformative, and that the first factor therefore weighs in its favor, because the works convey a different meaning or message than the photograph. Brief for Petitioner 33. The Court of Appeals erred, according to AWF, by not considering that new expression. Id., at 47-48.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,62,"But the first fair use factor instead focuses on whether an allegedly infringing use has a further purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be weighed against other considerations, like commercialism.

2022-007,63,"Here, the specific use of Goldsmith's photograph alleged to infringe her copyright is AWF's licensing of Orange Prince to Condé Nast. As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in magazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and AWF's copying use of it share substantially the same purpose. Moreover, the copying use is of a commercial nature. Even though Orange Prince adds new expression to Goldsmith's photograph, as the District Court found, this Court agrees with the Court of Appeals that, in the context of the challenged use, the first fair use factor still favors Goldsmith.",Sotomayor,0,

2022-007,66,"The Act, however, reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public interest: Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts. Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156, 95 S.Ct. 2040, 45 L.Ed.2d 84 (1975). Copyright thus trades off the benefits of incentives to create against the costs of restrictions on copying. The Act, for example, limits the duration of copyright, §§ 302-305, as required by the Constitution, makes facts and ideas uncopyrightable, § 102, and limits the scope of copyright owners' exclusive rights, §§ 107-122.",Sotomayor,0,

Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Act's fair use provision, in turn, sets forth general principles, the application of which requires judicial balancing, depending upon relevant circumstances. Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 1197, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021). Because those principles apply across a wide range of copyrightable material, from books to photographs to software, fair use is a flexible concept, and its application may well vary depending on context. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1197. For example, in applying the fair use provision, copyright's protection may be stronger where the copyrighted material  serves an artistic rather than a utilitarian function. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,74,"The first fair use factor is the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes. § 107(1). This factor considers the reasons for, and nature of, the copier's use of an original work. The central question it asks is whether the new work merely `supersedes the objects' of the original creation  (`supplanting' the original), or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (No. 4,901) (C.C.D. Mass. 1841) (Story, J.), and Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218). In that way, the first factor relates to the problem of substitution —copyright's bête noire. The use of an original work to achieve a purpose that is the same as, or highly similar to, that of the original work is more likely to substitute for, or `supplant,' the work, ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,75,"Consider the purposes listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching , scholarship, or research. Although the examples given are `illustrative and not limitative,' they reflect the sorts of copying that courts and Congress most commonly have found to be fair uses, and so may guide the first factor inquiry. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577-578, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting § 101). As the Court of Appeals observed, the examples are easily understood, as they contemplate the use of an original work to serve a manifestly different purpose from the work itself. 11 F.4th at 37. Criticism of a work, for instance, ordinarily does not supersede the objects of, or supplant, the work. Rather, it uses the work to serve a distinct end.4",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,76,"Not every instance will be clear cut, however. Whether a use shares the  purpose or character of an original work, or instead has a further purpose or different character, is a matter of degree. Most copying has some further purpose, in the sense that copying is socially useful ex post. Many secondary works add something new. That alone does not render such uses fair. Rather, the first factor (which is just one factor in a larger analysis) asks whether and to what extent the use at issue has a purpose or character different from the original. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (emphasis added). The larger the difference, the more likely the first factor weighs in favor of fair use. The smaller the difference, the less likely.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,77,"A use that has a further purpose or different character is said to be `transformative.' Ibid. (quoting P. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990) (hereinafter Leval)). As before, transformativeness is a matter of degree. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. That is important because the word transform, though not included in § 107, appears elsewhere in the Copyright Act. The statute defines derivative works, which the copyright owner has the exclusive right to prepare, § 106(2), to include any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, § 101. In other words, the owner has a right to derivative transformations of her work. Such transformations may be substantial, like the adaptation of a book into a movie. To be sure, this right is subject to fair use. § 106, see also § 107. The two are not mutually exclusive. But an overbroad concept of transformative use, one that includes any further purpose, or any different character, would narrow the copyright owner's exclusive right to create derivative works. To preserve that right, the degree of transformation required to make transformative use of an original must go beyond that required to qualify as a derivative.5",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,78,"For example, this Court in Campbell considered whether parody may be fair use. In holding that it may, the Court explained that parody has an obvious claim to transformative value because it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The use at issue in Campbell was 2 Live Crew's copying of certain lyrics and musical elements from Roy Orbison's song, Oh, Pretty Woman, to create a rap derivative titled Pretty Woman. Without a doubt, 2 Live Crew transformed Orbison's song by adding new lyrics and musical elements, such that Pretty Woman had a new message and different aesthetic than Oh, Pretty Woman. Indeed, the whole genre of music changed from rock ballad to rap. That was not enough for the first factor to weigh in favor of fair use, however. The Court found it necessary to determine whether 2 Live Crew's transformation of Orbison's song rose to the level of parody, a distinct purpose of commenting on the original or criticizing it. See id., at 580-583, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,79,"Distinguishing between parody (which targets an author or work for humor or ridicule) and satire (which ridicules society but does not necessarily target an author or work), the Court further explained that parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim's (or collective victims') imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing. Id., at 580-581, 114 S.Ct. 1164. More generally, when commentary has no critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition,  the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom larger. Id., at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164, see also id., at 597, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (Kennedy, J., concurring).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,80,"This discussion illustrates two important points: First, the fact that a use is commercial as opposed to nonprofit is an additional element of the first factor. Id., at 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The commercial nature of the use is not dispositive. Ibid., Google, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1204. But it is relevant. As the Court explained in Campbell, it is to be weighed against the degree to which the use has a further purpose or different character. See 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (The more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use), see also id., at 580, 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164.6",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,81,"Second, the first factor also relates to the justification for the use. In a broad sense, a use that has a distinct purpose is justified because it furthers the goal of copyright, namely, to promote the progress of science and the arts, without diminishing the incentive to create. See id., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 214 (C.A.2 2015) (Leval, J.) (The more the appropriator is using the copied material for new, transformative purposes, the more it serves copyright's goal of enriching public knowledge and the less likely it is that the appropriation will serve as a substitute for the original or its plausible derivatives, shrinking the protected market opportunities of the copyrighted work). A use that shares the purpose of a copyrighted work, by contrast, is more likely to provide the public with a substantial substitute for matter protected by the copyright owner's interests in the original work or derivatives of it, id., at 207, which undermines the goal of copyright.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,82,"In a narrower sense, a use may be justified because copying is reasonably necessary to achieve the user's new purpose. Parody, for example, needs to mimic an original to make its point. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 580-581, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Similarly, other commentary or criticism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to `conjure up' the original by borrowing from it. Id., at 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164.7  An independent justification like this is particularly relevant to assessing fair use where an original work and copying use share the same or highly similar purposes, or where wide dissemination of a secondary work would otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or licensed derivatives of it. See id., at 580, n. 14, 114 S.Ct. 1164, Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 557, 105 S.Ct. 2218. Once again, the question of justification is one of degree. See Leval 1111 (It is not sufficient simply to conclude whether or not justification exists. The question remains how powerful, or persuasive, is the justification, because the court must weigh the strength of the secondary user's justification against factors favoring the copyright owner).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,83,"In sum, the first fair use factor considers whether the use of a copyrighted work has a further purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be balanced against the commercial nature of the use. If an original work and a secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and the secondary use is of a commercial nature, the first factor is likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other justification for copying.8",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,85,"The fair use provision, and the first factor in particular, requires an analysis of the specific use of a copyrighted work that is alleged to be an infringement. § 107. The same copying may be fair when used for one purpose but not another. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (contrasting the use of a copyrighted work to advertise a product, even in a parody, with the sale of a parody for its own sake, let alone one performed a single time by students in school), Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 449-451, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984) (contrasting the recording of TV for a commercial or profit-making purpose with private home use).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,86,"Here, Goldsmith's copyrighted photograph has been used in multiple ways: After Goldsmith licensed the photograph to Vanity Fair to serve as an artist reference, Warhol used the photograph to create the Vanity Fair illustration and the other Prince Series works. Vanity Fair then used the photograph, pursuant to the license, when it published Warhol's illustration in 1984. Finally, AWF used the photograph when it licensed an image of Warhol's Orange Prince to Condé Nast in  2016. Only that last use, however, AWF's commercial licensing of Orange Prince to Condé Nast, is alleged to be infringing.9 We limit our analysis accordingly. In particular, the Court expresses no opinion as to the creation, display, or sale of any of the original Prince Series works.10",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,87,"A typical use of a celebrity photograph is to accompany stories about the celebrity, often in magazines. For example, Goldsmith licensed her photographs of Prince to illustrate stories about Prince in magazines such as Newsweek, Vanity Fair, and People. Supra, at 1266-1269. She even licensed her photographs for that purpose after Prince died in 2016. Supra, at 1269. A photographer may also license her creative work to serve as a reference for an artist, like Goldsmith did in 1984 when Vanity Fair wanted an image of Prince created by Warhol to illustrate an article about Prince. As noted by the Court of Appeals, Goldsmith introduced uncontroverted evidence that photographers generally license others to create stylized derivatives of their work in the vein of the Prince Series. 11 F.4th at 50, see 2 App. 291-299. In fact, Warhol himself paid to license photographs for some of his artistic renditions. Such licenses, for photographs or derivatives of them, are how photographers like Goldsmith make a living. They provide an economic incentive to create original works, which is the goal of copyright.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,88,"In 2016, AWF licensed an image of Orange Prince to Condé Nast to appear on the cover of a commemorative edition magazine about Prince. The edition, titled The Genius of Prince, celebrates the life and work of Prince Rogers Nelson, 1958-2016. It is undisputed here that the edition is devoted to Prince. 2 App. 352. In addition to AWF's image on the cover, the magazine contains numerous concert and studio photographs of Prince. In that context, the purpose of the image is substantially the same as that of Goldsmith's photograph. Both are portraits of Prince used in magazines to illustrate stories about Prince.11 Such environments  are not distinct and different. Google, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1203. AWF's licensing of the Orange Prince image thus `superseded the objects,' Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, i.e., shared the objectives, of Goldsmith's photograph, even if the two were not perfect substitutes.12",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,89,"The use also is of a commercial nature. § 107(1). Just as Goldsmith licensed her photograph to Vanity Fair for $400, AWF licensed Orange Prince to Condé Nast for  $10,000. The undisputed commercial character of AWF's use, though not dispositive, tends to weigh against a finding of fair use. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218.13",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,90,"Taken together, these two elements— that Goldsmith's photograph and AWF's 2016 licensing of Orange Prince share substantially the same purpose, and that AWF's use of Goldsmith's photo was of a commercial nature—counsel against fair use, absent some other justification for copying. That is, although a use's transformativeness may outweigh its commercial character, here, both elements point in the same direction.14",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,91,"The foregoing does not mean, however, that derivative works borrowing heavily from an original cannot be fair uses. In Google, the Court suggested that an `artistic painting' might, for example, fall within the scope of fair use even though it precisely replicates a copyrighted `advertising logo to make a comment about consumerism.' 593 U. S., at ___-___, 141 S.Ct. at 1203 (quoting 4 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright § 13.05A1b (2019), in turn quoting N. Netanel, Making Sense of Fair Use, 15 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 715, 746 (2011) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). That suggestion refers to Warhol's works that incorporate advertising logos, such as the Campbell's Soup Cans series. See fig. 7, infra.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,93,"Yet not all of Warhol's works, nor all uses of them, give rise to the same fair use analysis. In fact, Soup Cans well illustrates the distinction drawn here. The purpose of Campbell's logo is to advertise soup. Warhol's canvases do not share that purpose. Rather, the Soup Cans series uses Campbell's copyrighted work for an artistic commentary on consumerism, a purpose that is orthogonal to advertising soup. The use therefore does not supersede the objects of the advertising logo.15",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,94,"Moreover, a further justification for Warhol's use of Campbell's logo is apparent. His Soup Cans series targets the logo. That is, the original copyrighted work is, at least in part, the object of Warhol's commentary. It is the very nature of Campbell's copyrighted logo—well known to the public, designed to be reproduced, and a symbol of an everyday item for mass consumption—that enables the commentary. Hence, the use of the copyrighted work not only serves a completely different purpose, to comment on consumerism rather than to advertise soup, it also conjures up the original work to shed light on the work itself, not just the subject of the work. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164.16 Here, by contrast, AWF's use of Goldsmith's photograph does not target the photograph, nor has AWF offered another compelling justification for the use. See infra, at 1285-1286, and nn. 20-21.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,96,"AWF contends, however, that the purpose and character of its use of Goldsmith's photograph weighs in favor of fair use because Warhol's silkscreen image of the photograph, like the Campbell's Soup Cans series, has a new meaning or message. The District Court, for example, understood the Prince Series works to portray Prince as an iconic, larger-than-life  figure. 382 F.Supp.3d at 326. AWF also asserts that the works are a comment on celebrity. In particular, Warhol's Prince Series conveys the dehumanizing nature of celebrity. Brief for Petitioner 44. According to AWF, that new meaning or message, which the Court of Appeals ignored, makes the use transformative in the fair use sense. See id., at 44-48. We disagree.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,98,"Campbell did describe a transformative use as one that alters the first work with new expression, meaning, or message. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, see also Google, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203. That description paraphrased Judge Leval's law review article, which referred to new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings. Leval 1111. (Judge Leval contrasted such additions with secondary uses that merely repackage the original. Ibid.) But Campbell cannot be read to mean that § 107(1) weighs in favor of any use that adds some new expression, meaning, or message.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,99,"Otherwise, transformative use would swallow the copyright owner's exclusive right to prepare derivative works. Many derivative works, including musical arrangements, film and stage adaptions, sequels, spinoffs, and others that recast, transform or adapt the original, § 101, add new expression, meaning or message, or provide new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings. That is an intractable problem for AWF's interpretation of transformative use. The first fair use factor would not weigh in favor of a commercial remix of Prince's Purple Rain just because the remix added new expression or had a different aesthetic. A film or musical adaptation, like that of Alice Walker's The Color Purple, might win awards for its significant creative contribution, alter the meaning of a classic novel, and add important new expression, such as images, performances, original music, and lyrics. Post, at 1297-1298, 1304 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). But that does not in itself dispense with the need for licensing.17",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,100,"Campbell is again instructive. 2 Live Crew's version of Orbison's song easily conveyed a new meaning or message. It also had a different aesthetic. Yet the Court went further, examining whether and to what extent 2 Live Crew's song had the parodic purpose of commenting on the original or criticizing it. 510 U.S. at 583, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Parody is, of course, a kind of message. Moreover, the Court considered what the words of the songs might have meant to determine whether parody reasonably could be perceived. Ibid. But new meaning or message was not sufficient. If it had been, the Court could have made quick work of the first fair use factor. Instead, meaning or message was simply relevant to whether the new use served a purpose distinct from the original, or instead superseded its objects. That was,  and is, the central question under the first factor. Id., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,101,"The dissent commits the same interpretive error as AWF: It focuses on Campbell's paraphrase, yet ignores the rest of that decision's careful reasoning. Indeed, upon reading the dissent, someone might be surprised to learn that Campbell was about parody at all. Had expert testimony confirmed the obvious fact that 2 Live Crew's Pretty Woman differed in aesthetics and meaning from Orbison's original, that would have been the end of the dissent's analysis. See post, at 1299-1301 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). Not the Court's, however. Campbell was the culmination of a long line of cases and scholarship about parody's claim to fairness in borrowing. For purposes of copyright law, the Court explained, the heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works. 510 U.S. at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Campbell thus drew a nuanced distinction between parody and satire: While parody cannot function unless it conjures up the original, satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for  borrowing. Id., at 580-581, 114 S.Ct. 1164. The objective meaning or message of 2 Live Crew's song was relevant to this inquiry into the reasons for copying, but any new expression, meaning, or message was not the test.18",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,102,"What role meaning or message played in the Court of Appeals' analysis here is not entirely clear. The court correctly rejected the idea that any secondary work that adds a new aesthetic or new expression to its source material is necessarily transformative. 11 F.4th at 38-39. It also appeared correctly to accept that meaning or message is relevant to, but not dispositive of, purpose. See id., at 41 (The secondary work itself must reasonably be perceived as embodying a distinct artistic purpose, one that conveys a new meaning or message separate from its source material), id., at 42 (The judge must examine whether the secondary work's use of its source material is in service of a fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character, which must, at a bare minimum, comprise something more than the imposition of another artist's style on the primary work  (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,103,"Elsewhere, however, the Court of Appeals stated that the district judge should not assume the role of art critic and seek to ascertain the intent behind or meaning of the works at issue. Id., at 41. That statement is correct in part. A court should not attempt to evaluate the artistic significance of a particular work. See Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 251, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903) (Holmes, J.) (It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of a work, outside of  the narrowest and most obvious limits).19 Nor does the subjective intent of the user (or the subjective interpretation of a court) determine the purpose of the use. But the meaning of a secondary work, as reasonably can be perceived, should be considered to the extent necessary to determine whether the purpose of the use is distinct from the original, for instance, because the use comments on, criticizes, or provides otherwise unavailable information about the original, see, e.g., Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 215-216.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,105,"The District Court determined that the Prince Series works can reasonably be perceived to have transformed Prince from a vulnerable, uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life figure. 382 F.Supp.3d at 326. To make that determination, the District Court relied, in part, on testimony by Goldsmith that her photographs of Prince show that he is `not a comfortable person' and that he is `a vulnerable human being.' Ibid. An expert on Warhol, meanwhile, testified that the Prince Series works depict Prince as a kind of icon or totem of something, a mask-like simulacrum of his actual existence. 1 App. 249, 257.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,106,"The Court of Appeals noted, correctly, that whether a work is transformative cannot turn merely on the stated or perceived intent of the artist or the meaning or impression that a critic—or for that matter, a judge—draws from the work. 11 F.4th at 41. Otherwise, the law may well `recognize any alteration as transformative.' Ibid. (quoting 4 Nimmer, Copyright § 13.05B6). Whether the purpose and character of a use weighs in favor of fair use is, instead, an objective inquiry into what use was made, i.e., what the user does with the original work.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,107,"Granting the District Court's conclusion that Orange Prince reasonably can be perceived to portray Prince as iconic, whereas Goldsmith's portrayal is photorealistic, that difference must be evaluated in the context of the specific use at issue. The use is AWF's commercial licensing of Orange Prince to appear on the cover of Condé Nast's special commemorative edition. The purpose of that use is, still, to illustrate a magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince. Although the purpose could be more specifically described as illustrating a magazine about Prince with a portrait of Prince, one that portrays Prince somewhat differently from Goldsmith's photograph (yet has no critical bearing on her photograph),  that degree of difference is not enough for the first factor to favor AWF, given the specific context of the use.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,108,"To hold otherwise would potentially authorize a range of commercial copying of photographs, to be used for purposes that are substantially the same as those of the originals. As long as the user somehow portrays the subject of the photograph differently, he could make modest alterations to the original, sell it to an outlet to accompany a story about the subject, and claim transformative use. Many photographs will be open to various interpretations. A subject as open to interpretation as the human face, for example, reasonably can be perceived as conveying several possible meanings. The application of an artist's characteristic style to bring out a particular meaning that was available in the photograph is less likely to constitute a further purpose as Campbell used the term. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,109,"AWF asserts another, albeit related, purpose, which is to comment on the dehumanizing nature and effects of celebrity. Brief for Petitioner 44, 51. No doubt, many of Warhol's works, and particularly his uses of repeated images, can be perceived as depicting celebrities as commodities. But again, even if such commentary is perceptible on the cover of Condé Nast's tribute to Prince Rogers Nelson, 1958-2016, on the occasion of the man's death, AWF has a problem: The asserted commentary is at Campbell's lowest ebb. Because it has no critical bearing on Goldsmith's photograph,20 the commentary's claim to fairness in borrowing from her work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish). 510 U.S. at 580, 114 S.Ct. 1164.21 The commercial nature of the use, on the other hand, looms larger. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,110,"Here, the circumstances of AWF's 2016 licensing outweigh its diminished claim to fairness in copying under the first factor. Like satire that does not target an original work, AWF's asserted commentary can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing. Id., at 581, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Moreover, because AWF's commercial use of Goldsmith's photograph to illustrate a magazine about Prince is so similar to the photograph's typical use, a particularly compelling justification is needed. Yet AWF offers no independent justification, let alone a compelling one, for copying the photograph, other than to convey a new  meaning or message. As explained, that alone is not enough for the first factor to favor fair use.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,111,"Copying might have been helpful to convey a new meaning or message. It often is. But that does not suffice under the first factor. Nor does it distinguish AWF from a long list of would-be fair users: a musician who finds it helpful to sample another artist's song to make his own, a playwright who finds it helpful to adapt a novel, or a filmmaker who would prefer to create a sequel or spinoff, to name just a few.22 As Judge Leval has explained, a secondary author is not necessarily at liberty to make wholesale takings of the original author's expression merely because of how well the original author's expression would convey the secondary author's different message. Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 215.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,113,"The dissent would rather not debate these finer points. See post, at 1293, n. 2 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). It offers no theory of the relationship between transformative uses of original works and derivative works that transform originals. No reason why AWF was justified in using Goldsmith's original work in this specific instance. And no limiting principle for its apparent position that any use that is creative prevails under the first fair use factor. Instead, the dissent makes the simple (and obvious) point that restrictions on copying can inhibit follow-on works. `Nothing comes from nothing,' the dissent observes, `nothing ever could.' Post, at 1297. So somewhere in the copyright statute, there must be an escape valve to create something good. Post, at 1298. If AWF must pay Goldsmith to use her creation, the dissent claims, this will stifle creativity of every sort, thwart the expression of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge, and make our world poorer.

2022-007,114,"These claims will not age well. It will not impoverish our world to require AWF to pay Goldsmith a fraction of the proceeds from its reuse of her copyrighted work. Recall, payments like these are incentives for artists to create original works in the first place. Nor will the Court's decision, which is consistent with longstanding principles of fair use, snuff out the light of Western civilization, returning us to the Dark Ages of a world without Titian, Shakespeare, or Richard Rodgers. The dissent goes on at length about the basic premise that copyright (like other forms of intellectual property) involves a tradeoff between stimulating innovative activity, on the one hand, and allowing follow-on innovation, on the other. See post, at 1297-1298, and n. 4, 1304-1312. This theme will be familiar to any student of copyright law. In tracing the history of Renaissance painting, however, the dissent loses sight of the statute and this Court's cases. The Lives of the Artists undoubtedly makes for livelier reading than the U. S. Code or the U. S. Reports, but as a court, we do not have that luxury.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,115,"The dissent thus misses the forest for a tree. Its single-minded focus on the value of copying ignores the value of original works. It ignores the statute's focus on the  specific use alleged to be infringing. See n. 10, supra. It waves away the statute's concern for derivative works. Supra, at 1281-1283, and n. 17. It fails to appreciate Campbell's nuance. Supra, at 1282-1283, 1285, n. 21. And it disregards this Court's repeated emphasis on justification. Supra, at 1282-1283, and n. 18, 1285, n. 21.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,116,"The result of these omissions is an account of fair use that is unbalanced in theory and, perhaps relatedly, in tone. The dissent's conclusion—that whenever a use adds new meaning or message, or constitutes creative progress in the opinion of a critic or judge, the first fair use factor weighs in its favor—does not follow from its basic premise. Fair use instead strikes a balance between original works and secondary uses based in part on objective indicia of the use's purpose and character, including whether the use is commercial and, importantly, the reasons for copying.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,117,"Finally, copyright law is replete with escape valves: the idea-expression distinction, the general rule that facts may not receive protection, the requirement of originality, the legal standard for actionable copying, the limited duration of copyright, and, yes, the defense of fair use, including all its factors, such as whether the amount taken is reasonable in relation to the purpose of the use. These doctrines (and others) provide ample space for artists and other creators to use existing materials to make valuable new works. They account for most, if not all, of the examples given by the dissent, as well as the dissent's own copying (and the Court's, too). If the last century of American art, literature, music, and film is any indication, the existing copyright law, of which today's opinion is a continuation, is a powerful engine of creativity.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,119,"Lynn Goldsmith's original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists. Such protection includes the right to prepare derivative works that transform the original. The use of a copyrighted work may nevertheless be fair if, among other things, the use has a purpose and character that is sufficiently distinct from the original. In this case, however, Goldsmith's original photograph of Prince, and AWF's copying use of that photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine devoted to Prince, share substantially the same purpose, and the use is of a commercial nature. AWF has offered no other persuasive justification for its unauthorized use of the photograph. Therefore, the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes, § 107(1), weighs in Goldsmith's favor.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-007,120,"The Court has cautioned that the four statutory fair use factors may not be treated in isolation, one from another.

AWF does not challenge the Court of Appeals' determinations that the second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, § 107(2), third factor, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, § 107(3), and fourth factor, the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work, all favor Goldsmith.

2022-007,124,The question before us is a narrow one of statutory interpretation. It concerns the meaning of one of four factors Congress has instructed courts to consult when a party invokes the affirmative defense of fair use to a claim of copyright infringement. The statutory factor in question requires courts to consider the purpose and character of the use. 17 U.S.C. § 107(1). The parties disagree which purpose and character counts.,Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,125,"On the Foundation's telling, the statute requires courts to focus on the purpose the creator had in mind when producing his  work and the character of his resulting work. So what matters in this case is that Andy Warhol intended to apply a `new aesthetic' to Lynn Goldsmith's photograph and the character of his work `transformed' Prince from the `vulnerable, uncomfortable person' depicted in Ms. Goldsmith's photograph into `an iconic, larger-than-life figure.' Ante, at 1271, post, at 1294-1297, 1301 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Because the purpose and character of Mr. Warhol's work is so different from Ms. Goldsmith's, the Foundation insists, the first statutory factor points in favor of finding a fair-use affirmative defense.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,126,"By contrast, on Ms. Goldsmith's reading of the law and under the Second Circuit's approach, the first fair-use factor requires courts to assess the purpose and character of the challenged use. Ante, at 1277-1278. The Foundation now owns Mr. Warhol's image of Prince and it recently sought to license that image to a magazine looking for a depiction of Prince to accompany an article about Prince. Ibid. Ms. Goldsmith seeks to license her copyrighted photograph to exactly these kinds of buyers. And because the purpose and character of the Foundation's challenged use and the purpose and character of her own protected use overlap so completely, Ms. Goldsmith argues that the first statutory factor does not support a fair-use affirmative defense.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,127,"As I see it, the second view of the law is the better one. Nothing in the copyright statute calls on judges to speculate about the purpose an artist may have in mind when working on a particular project. Nothing in the law requires judges to try their hand at art criticism and assess the aesthetic character of the resulting work. Instead, the first statutory fair-use factor instructs courts to focus on the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes. § 107(1) (emphases added). By its terms, the law trains our attention on the particular use under challenge. And it asks us to assess whether the purpose and character of that use is different from (and thus complements) or is the same as (and thus substitutes for) a copyrighted work. It's a comparatively modest inquiry focused on how and for what reason a person is using a copyrighted work in the world, not on the moods of any artist or the aesthetic quality of any creation.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,128,"To my mind, three contextual clues confirm that this reading of the statutory text is the correct one.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,129,"First, the statutory preamble to all four fair-use factors instructs courts to assess whether the person asserting a fair-use defense seeks to use a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching , scholarship, or research. § 107 (emphasis added). Once more, the statute indicates that a court must examine the purpose of the particular use under challenge, not the artistic purpose underlying a work. And once more, the statute tasks courts with asking whether the challenged use serves a different purpose (as, say, a criticism of or comment on the original) or whether it seeks to serve the same purpose (as a substitute for the original).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,130,"Second, the copyright statute expressly protects a copyright holder's exclusive right to create derivative works that transform or adapt his original work. §§ 101, 106(2). So saying that a later user of a copyrighted work transformed its message and endowed it with a new aesthetic cannot automatically mean he has made fair use of it. Contra, post, at 1291-1292, 1303-1304, 1310-1312 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). To hold otherwise would risk making a nonsense of the statutory scheme—suggesting that transformative  uses of originals belong to the copyright holder (under § 106) but that others may simultaneously claim those transformative uses for themselves (under § 107). We aren't normally in the business of putting a statute at war with itself in this way. United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 180, 31 S.Ct. 632, 55 L.Ed. 663 (1911).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,131,"Finally, the fourth fair-use factor requires courts to assess the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. § 107(4). This Court has described the fourth factor as the most important one. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). This Court has said, too, that no factor may be treated in isolation, one from another. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994). Nor does anything in the fourth factor call on courts to speculate about artistic ambitions or aesthetics. Instead, it requires courts to ask whether consumers treat a challenged use as a market replacement for a copyrighted work or a market complement that does not impair demand for the original. Id., at 591, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Reading § 107 as a whole, then, it supplies courts with a sequential chain of questions about the particular challenged use—starting with its purpose and character (in the first factor) and ending with its effect (in the fourth). There is no double counting here. Contra, post, at 1303-1304 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Instead, the statute proceeds from step to step, asking judges to assess whether the challenged use (as revealed by its purpose, character, amount of source material used, and effect) serves as a complement to or a substitute for a copyrighted work.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,132,"With all this in mind, the Court's decision seems to me exactly right. Does Mr. Warhol's image seek to depict Prince as a larger-than-life icon while Ms. Goldsmith's photograph attempts to cast him in a more vulnerable light? See ante, at 1281-1286, post, at 1296-1297, 1311-1312 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Or are the artistic purposes latent in the two images and their aesthetic character actually more similar than that? Happily, the law does not require judges to tangle with questions so far beyond our competence. Instead, the first fair-use factor requires courts to assess only whether the purpose and character of the challenged use is the same as a protected use. And here, the undisputed facts reveal that the Foundation sought to use its image as a commercial substitute for Ms. Goldsmith's photograph. Of course, competitive products often differ in material respects and a buyer may find these differences reason to prefer one offering over another. Cf. post, at 1296-1297, 1301 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). But under the first fair-use factor the salient point is that the purpose and character of the Foundation's use involved competition with Ms. Goldsmith's image. To know that much is to know the first fair-use factor favors Ms. Goldsmith.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,133,"It is equally important, however, to acknowledge what this case does not involve and what the Court does not decide. Worried about the fate of artists seeking to portray reclining nudes or papal authorities, or authors hoping to build on classic literary themes? Post, at 1305-1312 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Worry not. This case does not call on us to strike a balance between rewarding creators and enabling others to build on their work. That is Congress's job. See U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Nor does this case even call on us to interpret and apply many of the reticulated elements of the Copyright Act that Congress has adopted to balance these competing interests. Our only job today is to interpret and apply faithfully one statutory factor among many Congress  has deemed relevant to the affirmative defense of fair use.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,134,"That observation points the way to another. The Court today does not even decide whether the Foundation's image of Prince infringes on Ms. Goldsmith's copyright. To uphold a claim of infringement under the Copyright Act, a court must find the defendant copied elements of the plaintiff's work that are themselves original. Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991). As part of this process, a court must isolate and vindicate only the truly original elements of a copyrighted work. See 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 8.01D (2022). The plaintiff must usually show not only a similarity but a substantial similarity between the allegedly infringing work and the original elements of his own copyrighted work. See 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.03A (2023). And even when two works are substantially similar, if both the plaintiff's and the defendant's works copy from a third source (reworking, say, a traditional artistic or literary theme), a claim for infringement generally will not succeed. See 2 Nimmer on Copyright § 8.01C. In this case, we address none of these questions or other elements of the infringement standard designed to ensure room for later artists to build on the work of their predecessors. The district court concluded that it need not address the merits of Ms. Goldsmith's infringement claim because the Foundation could prevail at summary judgment on its affirmative defense of fair use. 382 F.Supp.3d 312, 324 (SDNY 2019). The Second Circuit reversed, focused primarily on the district court's application of the four fair-use factors. 11 F.4th 26, 32 (2021), see id., at 36-52. And this Court granted review to decide only the question of fair use and only the role of a single factor in that affirmative defense. 596 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 1412, 212 L.Ed.2d 402 (2022).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-007,135,"Last but hardly least, while our interpretation of the first fair-use factor does not favor the Foundation in this case, it may in others. If, for example, the Foundation had sought to display Mr. Warhol's image of Prince in a nonprofit museum or a for-profit book commenting on 20th-century art, the purpose and character of that use might well point to fair use. But those cases are not this case. Before us, Ms. Goldsmith challenges only the Foundation's effort to use its portrait as a commercial substitute for her own protected photograph in sales to magazines looking for images of Prince to accompany articles about the musician. And our only point today is that, while the Foundation may often have a fair-use defense for Mr. Warhol's work, that does not mean it always will. Under the law Congress has given us, each challenged use must be assessed on its own terms.",Gorsuch,0,

2022-007,137,"Today, the Court declares that Andy Warhol's eye-popping silkscreen of Prince—a work based on but dramatically altering an existing photograph—is (in copyright lingo) not transformative. Still more, the Court decides that even if Warhol's portrait were transformative—even if its expression and meaning were worlds away from the photo—that fact would not matter. For in the majority's view, copyright law's first fair-use factor—addressing the purpose and character of the use made of a work—is uninterested in the distinctiveness and newness of Warhol's portrait. 17 U.S.C. § 107. What matters under that factor, the majority says, is instead a marketing decision: In the majority's  view, Warhol's licensing of the silkscreen to a magazine precludes fair use.1",Kagan,0,
2022-007,138,"You've probably heard of Andy Warhol, you've probably seen his art. You know that he reframed and reformulated—in a word, transformed—images created first by others. Campbell's soup cans and Brillo boxes. Photos of celebrity icons: Marilyn, Elvis, Jackie, Liz—and, as most relevant here, Prince. That's how Warhol earned his conspicuous place in every college's Art History 101. So it may come as a surprise to see the majority describe the Prince silkscreen as a modest alteration of Lynn Goldsmith's photograph—the result of some cropping and flattening— with the same essential nature. Ante, at 1270, 1280, n. 14, 1284-1285 (emphasis deleted). Or more generally, to observe the majority's lack of appreciation for the way his works differ in both aesthetics and message from the original templates. In a recent decision, this Court used Warhol paintings as the perfect exemplar of a copying use that adds something new and important—of a use that is transformative, and thus points toward a finding of fair use. Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., 593 U. S. ___, ___-___, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 1202-1203, 209 L.Ed.2d 311 (2021). That Court would have told this one to go back to school.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,139,"What is worse, that refresher course would apparently be insufficient. For it is not just that the majority does not realize how much Warhol added, it is that the majority does not care. In adopting that posture of indifference, the majority does something novel (though in law, unlike in art, it is rarely a good thing to be transformative). Before today, we assessed the purpose and character of a copier's use by asking the following question: Does the work add something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the original with new expression, meaning, or message? Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994), see Google, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203. When it did so to a significant degree, we called the work transformative and held that the fair-use test's first factor favored the copier (though other factors could outweigh that one). But today's decision—all the majority's protestations notwithstanding— leaves our first-factor inquiry in shambles. The majority holds that because Warhol licensed his work to a magazine—as Goldsmith sometimes also did—the first factor goes against him. See, e.g., ante, at 1285-1286. It does not matter how different the Warhol is from the original photo—how much new expression, meaning, or message he added. It does not matter that the silkscreen and the photo do not have the same aesthetic characteristics and do not convey the same meaning. It does not matter that because of those dissimilarities, the magazine publisher did not view the one as a substitute for the other. All that matters is that Warhol and the publisher entered into a licensing transaction, similar to one Goldsmith might have done. Because the artist had such a commercial purpose, all the creativity in the world could not save him.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,140,"That doctrinal shift ill serves copyright's core purpose. The law does not grant artists (and authors and composers and so on) exclusive rights—that is, monopolies—for their own sake. It does so to foster creativity —to promote the progress of both arts and science. U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. And for that same reason, the law also protects the fair use of copyrighted  material. Both Congress and the courts have long recognized that an overly stringent copyright regime actually stifles creativity by preventing artists from building on the work of others. Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750, 109 L.Ed.2d 184 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), see Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578-579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. For, let's be honest, artists don't create all on their own, they cannot do what they do without borrowing from or otherwise making use of the work of others. That is the way artistry of all kinds—visual, musical, literary— happens (as it is the way knowledge and invention generally develop). The fair-use test's first factor responds to that truth: As understood in our precedent, it provides breathing space for artists to use existing materials to make fundamentally new works, for the public's enjoyment and benefit. Id., at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. In now remaking that factor, and thus constricting fair use's boundaries, the majority hampers creative progress and undermines creative freedom. I respectfully dissent.2",Kagan,0,
2022-007,143,"Andy Warhol is the avatar of transformative copying. Cf. Google, 593 U. S., at ___-___, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203 (selecting Warhol, from the universe of creators, to illustrate what transformative copying is). In his early career, Warhol worked as a commercial illustrator and became experienced in varied techniques of reproduction. By night, he used those techniques— in particular, the silkscreen—to create his own art. His own—even though in one sense not. The silkscreen enabled him to make brilliantly novel art out of existing images carefully selected from popular culture. D. De Salvo, God Is in the Details, in Andy Warhol Prints 22 (4th rev. ed. 2003). The works he produced, connecting traditions of fine art with mass culture, depended on appropriations: The use of elements of an extant image is Warhol's entire modus operandi. B. Gopnik, Artistic Appropriation vs. Copyright Law, N. Y. Times, Apr. 6, 2021, p. C4 (internal quotation marks omitted). And with that m.o., he changed modern art, his appropriations and his originality were flipsides of each other. To a public accustomed to thinking of art as formal works belonging in gold frames—disconnected from the everyday world of products and personalities—Warhol's paintings landed like a thunderclap. A. Danto, Andy Warhol 36 (2009). Think Soup Cans or, in another vein, think Elvis. Warhol had created something very new—shockingly important, transformative art. B.

2022-007,144,"To see the method in action, consider one of Warhol's pre-Prince celebrity silkscreens —this one, of Marilyn Monroe. He began with a publicity photograph of the actress.

2022-007,145,"At that point, he produced a high-contrast, flattened image on a sheet of clear acetate. He used that image to trace an outline on the canvas. And he painted on top—applying exotic colors with a flat, even consistency and an industrial appearance. Id., at 165. The same high-contrast image was then reproduced in negative on a silkscreen, designed to function as a selectively porous mesh. Warhol would place the screen face down on the canvas, pour ink onto the back of the mesh, and use a squeegee to pull the ink through the weave and onto the canvas. Id., at 164. On some of his Marilyns (there are many), he reordered the process—first ink, then color, then (perhaps) ink again. See id., at 165-166. The result—see for yourself—is miles away from a literal copy of the publicity photo.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,146,"And the meaning is different from any the photo had. Of course, meaning in great art is contestable and contested (as is the premise that an artwork is great). But note what some experts say about the complex message(s) Warhol's Marilyns convey. On one level, those vivid, larger-than-life paintings are celebrity iconography, making a secular, profane subject transcendent and eternal. Id., at 209 (internal quotation marks omitted). But they also function as a biting critique of the cult of celebrity, and the role it plays in American life. With misaligned, Day-Glo  colors suggesting artificiality and industrial production, Warhol portrayed the actress as a consumer product. The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide 233 (2012), The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Marilyn (2023) (online source archived at https://www.supremecourt.gov). And in so doing, he exposed the deficiencies of a mass-media culture in which such superficial icons loom so large. 1 App. 208, 210 (internal quotation marks omitted).

2022-007,148,"As he did in the Marilyn series, Warhol cropped the photo, so that Prince's head fills the whole frame: It thus becomes disembodied, as if magically suspended in space. Id., at 174. And as before, Warhol converted the cropped photo into a higher-contrast image, incorporated into a silkscreen. That image isolated and exaggerated the darkest details of Prince's head, it also reduced his natural, angled position, presenting him in a more face-forward way. Id., at 223. Warhol traced, painted, and inked, as earlier described. See supra, at 1293-1294. He also made a second silkscreen, based on his tracings, the ink he passed through that screen left differently colored, out-of-kilter lines around Prince's face and hair (a bit hard to see in the reproduction below—more pronounced in the original). Altogether, Warhol made 14 prints and two drawings—the Prince series—in a range of unnatural, lurid hues. See Appendix, ante, at 1288. Vanity Fair chose the Purple Prince to accompany an article on the musician. Thirty-two years later, just after Prince died, Condé Nast paid Warhol (now actually his foundation, see supra, at 1292, n. 1) to use the Orange Prince on the cover of a special commemorative magazine. A picture (or two), as the saying goes, is worth a thousand words, so here is what those magazines published:",Kagan,0,
2022-007,149,"It does not take an art expert to see a transformation—but in any event, all those offering testimony in this case agreed there was one. The experts explained, in far greater detail than I have, the laborious and painstaking work that Warhol put into these and other portraits. See 1 App. 160-185, 212-216, 222-224. They described, in ways I have tried to suggest, the resulting visual differences between the photo and the silkscreen. As one summarized the matter: The two works are materially distinct in their composition, presentation, color palette, and media— i.e., in pretty much all their aesthetic traits. Id., at 227.3 And with the change in form came an undisputed change in meaning. Goldsmith's focus—seen in what one expert called the corporeality and luminosity of her depiction—was on Prince's unique human identity. Id., at 176, 227. Warhol's focus was more nearly the opposite. His subject was not the private person but the public image. Id., at 159. The artist's flattened, cropped, exotically colored, and unnatural depiction of Prince's disembodied head sought to communicate a message about the impact of celebrity in contemporary life. Id., at 227. On Warhol's canvas, Prince emerged as spectral, dark, and uncanny—less a real person than a mask-like simulacrum. Id., at 187, 249. He was reframed as a larger than life icon or totem. Id., at 257. Yet he was also reduced: He became the product of a publicity machine that packages and disseminates commoditized images. Id., at 160. He manifested, in short, the dehumanizing culture of celebrity in America. The message could not have been more different.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,150,"A thought experiment may pound the point home. Suppose you were the editor of Vanity Fair or Condé Nast, publishing an article about Prince. You need, of course, some kind of picture. An employee  comes to you with two options: the Goldsmith photo, the Warhol portrait. Would you say that you don't really care? That the employee is free to flip a coin? In the majority's view, you apparently would. Its opinion, as further discussed below, is built on the idea that both are just portraits of Prince that may equivalently be used to depict Prince in magazine stories about Prince.

2022-007,151,"In any event, the editors of Vanity Fair and Condé Nast understood the difference —the gulf in both aesthetics and meaning—between the Goldsmith photo and the Warhol portrait. They knew about the photo, but they wanted the portrait. They saw that as between the two works, Warhol had effected a transformation.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,153,"The question in this case is whether that transformation should matter in assessing whether Warhol made fair use of Goldsmith's copyrighted photo. The answer is yes—it should push toward (although not dictate) a finding of fair use. That answer comports with the copyright statute, its underlying policy, and our precedent concerning the two. Under established copyright law (until today), Warhol's addition of important new expression, meaning, and message counts in his favor in the fair-use inquiry. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,154,"Start by asking a broader question: Why do we have fair use anyway? The majority responds that while copyrights encourage the making of creative works, fair use promotes their public availability. Ante, at 1273 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that description sells fair use far short. Beyond promoting availability, fair use itself advances creativity and artistic progress. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (fair use is necessary to fulfill copyright's very purpose—to promote science and the arts). That is because creative work does not happen in a vacuum. Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could, said songwriter Richard Rodgers, maybe thinking not only about love and marriage but also about how the Great American Songbook arose from vaudeville, ragtime, the blues, and jazz.4 This Court has long understood the point—has gotten how new art, new invention, and new knowledge arise from existing works. Our seminal opinion on fair use quoted the illustrious Justice Story:",Kagan,0,
2022-007,155,"In truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any,  things, which  are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before. Id., at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Emerson v. Davies, 8 F.Cas. 615, 619 (No. 4,436) (C.C.D. Mass. 1845)).",Kagan,0,
2022-007,156,"Because that is so, a copyright regime with no escape valves would stifle the very creativity which the law is designed to foster. Stewart, 495 U.S. at 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750. Fair use is such an escape valve. It allows others to build upon copyrighted material, so as not to put manacles upon creative progress. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks omitted). In short, copyright's core value—promoting creativity—sometimes demands a pass for copying.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,157,"To identify when that is so, the courts developed and Congress later codified a multi-factored inquiry. As the majority describes, see ante, at 1273-1274, the current statute sets out four non-exclusive considerations to guide courts. They are: (1) the purpose and character of the use made of the copyrighted work, including whether such use is of a commercial nature, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. Those factors sometimes point in different directions, if so, a court must weigh them against each other. In doing so, we have stated, courts should view the fourth factor—which focuses on the copyright holder's economic interests —as the most important. See Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 566, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).5 But the overall balance cannot come out right unless each factor is assessed correctly. This case, of course, is about (and only about) the first.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,158,"And that factor is distinctive: It is the only one that focuses on what the copier's use of the original work accomplishes. The first factor asks about the character of that use—its main or essential nature, especially as strongly marked and serving  to distinguish. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 376 (1976). And the first factor asks about the purpose of the use—the object, effect, or result aimed at, intended, or attained. Id., at 1847. In that way, the first factor gives the copier a chance to make his case. See P. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105, 1116 (1990) (describing factor 1 as the soul of the fair use defense). Look, the copier can say, at how I altered the original, and what I achieved in so doing. Look at how (as Judge Leval's seminal article put the point) the original was used as raw material and was transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights. Id., at 1111. That is hardly the end of the fair-use inquiry (commercialism, too, may bear on the first factor, and anyway there are three factors to go), but it matters profoundly. Because when a transformation of the original work has occurred, the user of the work has made the kind of creative contribution that copyright law has as its object.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,159,"Don't take it from me (or Judge Leval): The above is exactly what this Court has held about how to apply factor 1. In Campbell, our primary case on the topic, we stated that the first factor's purpose-and-character test centrally concerns whether and to what extent the new work is `transformative.' 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Leval 1111). That makes sense, we explained, because the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. We then expounded on when such a transformation happens. Harking back to Justice Story, we explained that a new work might merely `supersede the objects' of the original creation—meaning, that it does no more, and for no other end, than the first work had. Ibid. (quoting Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F.Cas. 342, 348 (No. 4,901) (C.C.D. Mass. 1841)). But alternatively, the new work could add something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Forgive me, but given the majority's stance (see, e.g., ante, at 1284-1285), that bears repeating: The critical factor 1 inquiry, we held, is whether a new work alters the first with new expression, meaning, or message. The more it does so, the more transformative the new work. And (here is the final takeaway) the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Under that approach, the Campbell Court held, the rap group 2 Live Crew's transformative copying of Roy Orbison's Pretty Woman counted in favor of fair use. Id., at 583, 114 S.Ct. 1164. And that was so even though the rap song was, as everyone agreed, recorded and later sold for profit. See id., at 573, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,160,"Just two Terms ago, in Google, we made all the same points. We quoted Campbell in explaining that the factor 1 inquiry is whether the copier's use `adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering' the copyrighted work `with new expression, meaning, or message.' 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1219. We again described a copying use that adds something new and important as transformative. Ibid. We reiterated that protecting transformative uses stimulates creativity and thus fulfills the objective of copyright law. Ibid. (quoting Leval 1111). And then we gave an example. Yes, of course, we pointed to Andy Warhol. (The majority claims not to be embarrassed by this embarrassing fact because the specific reference was to his Soup Cans, rather than his celebrity images.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,161,"But drawing a distinction between a commentary on consumerism—which is how the majority describes his soup canvases, ante, at 1281—and a commentary on celebrity culture, i.e., the turning of people into consumption items, is slicing the baloney pretty thin.) Finally, the Court conducted the first-factor inquiry it had described. Google had replicated Sun Microsystems' computer code as part of a commercial endeavor, done for commercial profit. 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1204. No matter, said the Court. Many common fair uses are indisputably commercial. Ibid. What mattered instead was that Google had used Sun's code to make something new and important: a highly creative and innovative software platform. Id., at ___-___, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203. The use of the code, the Court held, was therefore transformative and pointed toward fair use. Id., at ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1203, 1204-1205.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,162,"Campbell and Google also illustrate the difference it can make in the world to protect transformative works through fair use. Easy enough to say (as the majority does, see ante, at 1296) that a follow-on creator should just pay a licensing fee for its use of an original work. But sometimes copyright holders charge an out-of-range price for licenses. And other times they just say no. In Campbell, for example, Orbison's successor-in-interest turned down 2 Live Crew's request for a license, hoping to block the rap take-off of the original song. See 510 U.S. at 572-573, 114 S.Ct. 1164. And in Google, the parties could not agree on licensing terms, as Sun insisted on conditions that Google thought would have subverted its business model. See 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1190-1191. So without fair use, 2 Live Crew's and Google's works—however new and important —might never have been made or, if made, never have reached the public. The prospect of that loss to creative progress is what lay behind the Court's inquiry into transformativeness—into the expressive novelty of the follow-on work (regardless whether the original creator granted permission). Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1203, see Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,163,"Now recall all the ways Warhol, in making a Prince portrait from the Goldsmith photo, added something new, with a further purpose or different character—all the ways he altered the original work's expression, meaning, and message. Ibid. The differences in form and appearance, relating to composition, presentation, color palette, and media. 1 App. 227, see supra, at 1294-1297. The differences in meaning that arose from replacing a realistic —and indeed humanistic—depiction of the performer with an unnatural, disembodied, masklike one. See ibid. The conveyance of new messages about celebrity culture and its personal and societal impacts. See ibid. The presence of, in a word, transformation—the kind of creative building that copyright exists to encourage. Warhol's use, to be sure, had a commercial aspect. Like most artists, Warhol did not want to hide his works in a garret, he wanted to sell them. But as Campbell and Google both demonstrate (and as further discussed below), that fact is nothing near the showstopper the majority claims. Remember, the more transformative the work, the less commercialism matters. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, supra, at 1299, ante, at 1276 (acknowledging the point, even while refusing to give it any meaning). The dazzling creativity evident in the Prince portrait might not get Warhol all the way home in the fair-use inquiry, there remain other factors to be considered and possibly weighed against the first one. See supra, at 1292, 1296-1297, 1299. But the purpose and character of Warhol's use of the copyrighted  work—what he did to the Goldsmith photo, in service of what objects— counts powerfully in his favor. He started with an old photo, but he created a new new thing.6",Kagan,0,
2022-007,165,"The majority does not see it. And I mean that literally. There is precious little evidence in today's opinion that the majority has actually looked at these images, much less that it has engaged with expert views of their aesthetics and meaning. Whatever new expression Warhol added, the majority says, was not transformative. See ante, at 1280. Apparently, Warhol made only modest alterations. Ante, at 1285. Anyone, the majority suggests, could have cropped, flattened, traced, and colored the photo as Warhol did. Ante, at 1270. True, Warhol portrayed Prince somewhat differently. Ante, at 1284. But the degree of difference is too small: It consists merely in applying Warhol's characteristic style—an aesthetic gloss, if you will—to bring out a particular meaning that was already available in Goldsmith's photograph. Ibid. So too, Warhol's commentary on celebrity culture matters not at all, the majority is not willing to concede that it even exists. See ante, at 1285 (even if such commentary is perceptible). And as for the District Court's view that Warhol transformed Prince from a vulnerable, uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life figure, the majority is downright dismissive. Ante, at 1284. Vulnerable, iconic—who cares? The silkscreen and the photo, the majority claims, still have the same essential nature. Ante, at 1280, n. 14 (emphasis deleted).",Kagan,0,
2022-007,166,"The description is disheartening. It's as though Warhol is an Instagram filter, and a simple one at that (e.g., sepiatinting). What is all the fuss about?, the majority wants to know. Ignoring reams of expert evidence—explaining, as every art historian could explain, exactly what the fuss is about—the majority plants itself firmly in the I could paint that school of art criticism. No wonder the majority sees the two images as essentially fungible products in the magazine market—publish this one, publish that one, what does it matter? See ante, at 1278-1279, supra, at 1296-1297. The problem is that it does matter, for all the reasons given in the record and discussed above. See supra, at 1296-1297. Warhol based his silkscreen on a photo, but fundamentally changed its character and meaning. In belittling those creative contributions, the majority guarantees that it will reach the wrong result.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,167,"Worse still, the majority maintains that those contributions, even if significant, just would not matter. All of Warhol's artistry and social commentary is negated by one thing: Warhol licensed his portrait to a magazine, and Goldsmith sometimes licensed her photos to magazines too. That is the sum and substance of the majority opinion. Over and over, the majority incants that both works are portraits of Prince used in magazines to illustrate stories about Prince, they therefore both share substantially the same purpose— meaning, a commercial one. Ante, at 1278, 1287, see ante, at 1272-1273, 1281, n. 15, 1284-1285, 1285-1286. Or said otherwise, because Warhol entered into a licensing transaction with Condé Nast, he could not get any help from factor 1—regardless how transformative his image was. See, e.g., ante, at 1285-1286 (Warhol's licensing outweighs any new meaning or message he could have offered). The majority's  commercialism-trumps-creativity analysis has only one way out. If Warhol had used Goldsmith's photo to comment on or critique Goldsmith's photo, he might have availed himself of that factor's benefit (though why anyone would be interested in that work is mysterious). See ante, at 1285. But because he instead commented on society —the dehumanizing culture of celebrity —he is (go figure) out of luck.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,168,"From top-to-bottom, the analysis fails. It does not fit the copyright statute. It is not faithful to our precedent. And it does not serve the purpose both Congress and the Court have understood to lie at the core of fair use: stimulating creativity, by enabling artists and writers of every description to build on prior works. Google, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203. That is how art, literature, and music happen, it is also how all forms of knowledge advance. Even as the majority misconstrues the law, it misunderstands—and threatens— the creative process.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,169,"Start with what the statute tells us about whether the factor 1 inquiry should disregard Warhol's creative contributions because he licensed his work. (Sneak preview: It shouldn't.) The majority claims the text as its strong suit, viewing our precedents' inquiry into new expression and meaning as a faulty paraphrase of the statutory language. Ante, at 1281-1283. But it is the majority, not Campbell and Google, that misreads § 107(1). First, the key term character plays little role in the majority's analysis. See ante, at 1272-1273, 1278-1279, and n. 11, 1282-1283 (statements of central test or holding referring only to purpose). And you can see why, given the counter-intuitive meaning the majority (every so often) provides. See ante, at 1279-1280, and n. 14. When referring to the character of what Warhol did, the majority says merely that he licensed Orange Prince to Condé Nast for $10,000. See ante, at 1279-1280. But that reductionist view rids the term of most of its ordinary meaning. Character typically refers to a thing's main or essential nature, especially as strongly marked and serving to distinguish. Webster's Third 376, see supra, at 1298-1299. The essential and distinctive nature of an artist's use of a work commonly involves artistry —as it did here. See also Campbell, 510 U.S. at 582, 588-589, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (discussing the expressive character of 2 Live Crew's rap). So the term character makes significant everything the record contains—and everything everyone (save the majority) knows—about the differences in expression and meaning between Goldsmith's photo and Warhol's silkscreen.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,170,"Second, the majority significantly narrows § 107(1)'s reference to purpose (thereby paralleling its constriction of character). It might be obvious to you that artists have artistic purposes. And surely it was obvious to the drafters of a law aiming to promote artistic (and other kinds of) creativity. But not to the majority, which again cares only about Warhol's decision to license his art. Warhol's purpose, the majority says, was just to depict Prince in a magazine story about Prince in exchange for money. Ante, at 1273. The majority spurns all that mattered to the artist—evident on the face of his work—about expression, meaning, and message. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, Google, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1202-1203. That indifference to purposes beyond the commercial—for what an artist, most fundamentally, wants to communicate—finds no support in § 107(1).7  Still more, the majority's commercialism-über-alles view of the factor 1 inquiry fits badly with two other parts of the fair-use provision. To begin, take the preamble, which gives examples of uses often thought fair: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,  scholarship, or research. § 107. As we have explained, an emphasis on commercialism would swallow those uses—that is, would mostly deprive them of fair-use protection. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164. For the listed activities are generally conducted for profit in this country. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). No man but a blockhead, Samuel Johnson once noted, ever wrote except for money. 3 Boswell's Life of Johnson 19 (G. Hill ed. 1934). And Congress of course knew that when it drafted the preamble.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,171,"Next, skip to the last factor in the fair-use test: the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. § 107(4). You might think that when Congress lists two different factors for consideration, it is because the two factors are, well, different. But the majority transplants factor 4 into factor 1. Recall that the majority conducts a kind of market analysis: Warhol, the majority says, licensed his portrait of Prince to a magazine that Goldsmith could have licensed her photo to—and so may have caused her economic harm. See ante, at 1278-1279, see also ante, at 1276-1277 (focusing on whether a follow-on work is a market substitute for the original), ante, at 1290 (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (describing the salient point as whether Warhol's use involved competition with Ms. Goldsmith's image). That issue is no doubt important in the fair-use inquiry. But it is the stuff of factor 4: how Warhol's use affected the value of or market for Goldsmith's photo. Factor 1 focuses on the other side of the equation: the new expression, meaning, or message that may come from someone else using the original. Under the statute, courts are supposed to strike a balance between the two—and thus between rewarding original creators and enabling others to build on their works. That cannot happen when a court, à la the majority, double-counts the first goal and ignores the second.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,172,"Is it possible I overstate the matter? I would like for that to be true. And a puzzling aspect of today's opinion is that it occasionally acknowledges the balance that the fair-use provision contemplates. So, for example, the majority notes after reviewing the relevant text that the central question the first factor asks is whether the new work adds something new to the copyrighted one. Ante, at 1274 (internal quotation marks omitted). Yes, exactly. And in other places, the majority suggests that a court should consider in the factor 1 analysis not merely the commercial context but also the copier's addition of new expression, including new meaning or message. Ante, at 1272-1273, see ante, at  1276, 1280, n. 13, 1280, 1284. In that way, the majority opinion differs from Justice GORSUCH's concurrence, which would exclude all inquiry into whether a follow-on work is transformative. See ante, at 1289, 1290. And it is possible lower courts will pick up on that difference, and ensure that the newness of a follow-on work will continue to play a significant role in the factor 1 analysis. If so, I'll be happy to discover that my claims have not aged well. Ante, at 1286. But that would require courts to do what the majority does not: make a serious inquiry into the follow-on artist's creative contributions. The majority's refusal to do so is what creates the oddity at the heart of today's opinion. If newness matters (as the opinion sometimes says), then why does the majority dismiss all the newness Warhol added just because he licensed his portrait to Condé Nast? And why does the majority insist more generally that in a commercial context conveying a new meaning or message is not enough for the first factor to favor fair use? Ante, at 1285-1286.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,173,"Certainly not because of our precedent— which conflicts with nearly all the majority says. As explained earlier, this Court has decided two important cases about factor 1. See supra, at 1299-1300. In each, the copier had built on the original to make a product for sale—so the use was patently commercial. And in each, that fact made no difference, because the use was also transformative. The copier, we held, had made a significant creative contribution —had added real value. So in Campbell, we did not ask whether 2 Live Crew and Roy Orbison both meant to make money by including a catchy song about women on a record album. But cf. ante, at 1273 (asking whether Warhol and Goldsmith both meant to charge for depicting Prince in magazine stories about Prince). We instead asked whether 2 Live Crew had added significant new expression, meaning, and message, and because we answered yes, we held that the group's rap song did not merely supersede the objects of the original creation. 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Similarly, in Google, we took for granted that Google (the copier) and Sun (the original author) both meant to market software platforms facilitating the same tasks—just as (in the majority's refrain) Warhol and Goldsmith both wanted to market images depicting the same subject. See 593 U. S., at ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1203, 1204. So what? was our basic response. Google's copying had enabled the company to make a highly creative and innovative tool, advancing creative progress and thus serving the basic constitutional objective of copyright. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 1203 (internal quotation marks omitted). Search today's opinion high and low, you will see no such awareness of how copying can help produce valuable new works.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,174,"Nor does our precedent support the majority's strong distinction between follow-on works that target the original and those that do not. Ante, at 1285-1286. (Even the majority does not claim that anything in the text does so.) True enough that the rap song in Campbell fell into the former category: 2 Live Crew urged that its work was a parody of Orbison's song. But even in discussing the value of parody, Campbell made clear the limits of targeting's importance. The Court observed that as the extent of transformation increases, the relevance of targeting decreases. 510 U.S. at 581, n. 14, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Google proves the point. The new work there did not parody, comment on, or otherwise direct itself to the old: The former just made use of the latter for its own devices. Yet that fact never made an appearance in the Court's opinion, what mattered instead was the highly creative use  Google had made of the copied code. That decision is on point here. Would Warhol's work really have been more worthy of protection if it had (somehow) shed light on Goldsmith's photograph, rather than on Prince, his celebrity status, and celebrity culture? Ante, at 1281. Would that Goldsmith-focused work (whatever it might be) have more meaningfully advanced creative progress, which is copyright's raison d'être, than the work he actually made? I can't see how, more like the opposite. The majority's preference for the directed work, apparently on grounds of necessity, see ante, at 1281, 1285-1286, again reflects its undervaluing of transformative copying as a core part of artistry.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,175,"And there's the rub. (Yes, that's mostly Shakespeare.) As Congress knew, and as this Court once saw, new creations come from building on—and, in the process, transforming—those coming before. Today's decision stymies and suppresses that process, in art and every other kind of creative endeavor. The decision enhances a copyright holder's power to inhibit artistic development, by enabling her to block even the use of a work to fashion something quite different. Or viewed the other way round, the decision impedes non-copyright holders' artistic pursuits, by preventing them from making even the most novel uses of existing materials. On either account, the public loses: The decision operates to constrain creative expression.8",Kagan,0,
2022-007,176,"The effect, moreover, will be dramatic. Return again to Justice Story, see supra, at 1297-1298: In literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things that are new and original throughout. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quoting Emerson, 8 F.Cas. at 619). Every work borrows, and must necessarily do so. 510 U.S. at 575, 114 S.Ct. 1164. Creators themselves know that fact deep in their bones. Here is Mark Twain on the subject: The kernel, the soul—let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of creative works—all are consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources. Letter from M. Twain to H. Keller, in 2 Mark Twain's Letters 731 (1917), see also id., at 732 (quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes—no, not that one, his father the poet—as saying I have never originated anything altogether myself, nor met anybody who had). Appropriation, mimicry, quotation, allusion and sublimated collaboration, novelist Jonathan Lethem has explained, are a kind of sine qua non of the creative act, cutting across all forms and genres in the realm of cultural production. The Ecstasy of Influence, in Harper's Magazine 61 (Feb. 2007). Or as Mary Shelley once wrote, there is no such thing as creating out of a void. Frankenstein ix (1831).9  Consider, in light of those authorial references, how the majority's factor 1 analysis might play out in literature. And why not start with the best? Shakespeare borrowed over and over and over. See, e.g., 8 Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare 351-352 (G. Bullough ed. 1975) (Shakespeare was an adapter of other men's tales and plays, he liked to build a new construction on something given). I could point to a whole slew of works, but let's take Romeo and Juliet as an example. Shakespeare's version copied most directly from Arthur Brooke's The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, written a few decades earlier (though of course Brooke copied from someone, and that person copied from someone, and that person  going back at least to Ovid's story about Pyramus and Thisbe). Shakespeare took plot, characters, themes, even passages: The friar's line to Romeo, Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art, appeared in Brooke as Art thou a man? The shape saith so thou art. Bullough 387. (Shakespeare was, among other things, a good editor.) Of course Shakespeare also added loads of genius, and so made the borrowed stories uniquely Shakespearian. G. Williams, Shakespeare's Basic Plot Situation, 2 Shakespeare Quarterly No. 4, p. 313 (Oct. 1951). But on the majority's analysis? The two works—Shakespeare's and Brooke's—are just two stories of star-crossed lovers written for commercial gain. Shakespeare would not qualify for fair use, he would not even come out ahead on factor 1.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,177,"And if you think that's just Shakespeare, here are a couple more. (Once you start looking, examples are everywhere.) Lolita, though hard to read today, is usually thought one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. But the plotline—an adult man takes a room as a lodger, embarks on an obsessive sexual relationship with the preteen daughter of the house, and eventually survives her death, remaining marked forever—appears in a story by Heinz von Lichberg written a few decades earlier. Oh, and the girl's name is Lolita in both versions. See generally M. Maar, The Two Lolitas (2005). All that said, the two works have little in common artistically, nothing literary critics admire in the second Lolita is found in the first. But to the majority? Just two stories of revoltingly lecherous men, published for profit. So even factor 1 of the fair-use inquiry would not aid Nabokov. Or take one of the most famed adventure stories ever told.

Under the majority's view, Handy could then have controlled—meaning, curtailed—the development of the genre. And also of a fair bit of rock and roll. Just another rendition of 12-bar blues for sale in record stores, the majority would say to Chuck Berry (Johnny B. Goode), Bill Haley (Rock Around the Clock), Jimi Hendrix (Red House), or Eric Clapton (Crossroads). Or to switch genres, imagine a pioneering classical composer (Haydn?) had copyrighted the three-section sonata form.

Stravinsky reportedly said that great composers do not imitate, but instead steal. See P. Yates, Twentieth Century Music 41 (1967). At any rate, he would have known. He took music from all over—from Russian folk melodies to Schoenberg—and made it inimitably his own. And then—as these things go—his music became a source for others. Charlie Parker turned The Rite of Spring into something of a jazz standard: You can still hear the Stravinsky lurking, but jazz musicians make the composition a thing of a different kind. And popular music? I won't point fingers, but maybe rock's only Nobel Laureate and greatest-ever lyricist is known for some appropriations? See M.

2022-007,191,"To begin with, note the word after in Bacon's title. Copying is so deeply rooted in the visual arts that there is a naming convention for it, with after denoting that a painting is some kind of imitation of a known work. M. Clarke, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms 5 (2d ed. 2010). Bacon made frequent use of that convention. He was especially taken by Velázquez's portrait of Innocent X, referring to it in tens of paintings. In the one shown above, Bacon retained the subject, scale, and composition of the Velázquez original. Look at one, look at the other, and you know Bacon copied. But he also transformed. He invested his portrait with new expression, meaning, and message, converting Velázquez's study of magisterial power into one of mortal dread. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Kagan,0,

2022-007,193,"The majority thus treats creativity as a trifling part of the fair-use inquiry, in disregard of settled copyright principles and what they reflect about the artistic process. On the majority's view, an artist had best not attempt to market even a transformative follow-on work—one that adds significant new expression, meaning, or message. That added value (unless it comes from critiquing the original) will no longer receive credit under factor 1. And so it can never hope to outweigh factor 4's assessment of the copyright holder's interests. The result will be what this Court has often warned against: suppression of the very creativity which copyright law is designed to foster. Stewart, 495 U.S. at 236, 110 S.Ct. 1750, see supra, at 1297-1298. And not just on the margins. Creative progress unfolds through use and reuse, framing and reframing: One work builds on what has gone before, and later works build on that one, and so on through time. Congress grasped the idea when it directed courts to attend to the purpose and character of artistic borrowing—to what the borrower has made out of existing materials. That inquiry recognizes the value in using existing materials to fashion something new. And so too, this Court— from Justice Story's time to two Terms ago—has known that it is through such iterative processes that knowledge accumulates and art flourishes. But not anymore. The majority's decision is no continuation of existing copyright law. Ante, at 1287. In declining to acknowledge the importance of transformative copying, the Court today, and for the first time, turns its back on how creativity works.",Kagan,0,
2022-007,195,"And the workings of creativity bring us back to Andy Warhol. For Warhol, as this Court noted in Google, is the very embodiment of transformative copying. He is proof of concept—that an artist working from a model can create important new expression. Or said more strongly, that appropriations can help bring great art into being. Warhol is a towering figure in modern art not despite but because of his use of source materials. His work—whether Soup Cans and Brillo Boxes or Marilyn and Prince—turned something not his into something all his own. Except that it also became all of ours, because his work today occupies a significant place not only in our museums but in our wider artistic culture. And if the majority somehow cannot see it—well, that's what evidentiary records are for. The one in this case contained undisputed testimony, and lots of it, that Warhol's Prince series conveyed a fundamentally different idea, in a fundamentally different artistic style, than the photo he started from. That is not the end of the fair-use inquiry. The test, recall, has four parts, with one focusing squarely on Goldsmith's interests. But factor 1 is supposed to measure what Warhol has done. Did his new work add something new, with a further purpose or different character? Campbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.",Kagan,0,

2022-007,197,"Still more troubling are the consequences of today's ruling for other artists. If Warhol does not get credit for transformative copying, who will? And when artists less famous than Warhol cannot benefit from fair use, it will matter even more. Goldsmith would probably have granted Warhol a license with few conditions, and for a price well within his budget. But as our precedents show, licensors sometimes place stringent limits on follow-on uses, especially to prevent kinds of expression they disapprove. And licensors may charge fees that prevent many or most artists from gaining access to original works. Of course, that is all well and good if an artist wants merely to copy the original and market it as his own. Preventing those uses—and thus incentivizing the creation of original works—is what copyrights are for. But when the artist wants to make a transformative use, a different issue is presented. By now, the reason why should be obvious. Inhibiting subsequent writers and artists from improving upon prior works—as the majority does today—will frustrate the very ends sought to be attained by copyright law. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 549, 105 S.Ct. 2218. It will stifle creativity of every sort. It will impede new art and music and literature.

Under that provision, the Secretary sets out a standard for determining when an employee is a bona fide executive. If that standard is met, the employee has no right to overtime wages.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,35,"From as early as 1940, the Secretary's bona fide executive standard has comprised three distinct parts. See 84 Fed. Reg. 51230 (2019) (summarizing the standard's history). The first is the salary basis test—the subject matter of this case. Ibid. The basic idea for now (greater detail and disputation will follow) is that an employee can be a bona fide executive only if he receives a predetermined and fixed  salary—one that does not vary with the precise amount of time he works. Ibid. The second element is the salary level test: It asks whether that preset salary exceeds a specified amount. Ibid. And the third is the duties test, which focuses on the nature of the employee's job responsibilities. Ibid. When all three criteria are met, the employee (because considered a bona fide executive) is excluded from the FLSA's protections.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,36,"Now, though, add a layer of complexity to that description: The Secretary has implemented the bona fide executive standard through two separate and slightly different rules, one applying to lower-income employees and the other to higher-income ones. The so-called general rule pertains to employees making less than $100,000 in total annual compensation, including not only salary but also commissions, bonuses, and the like. 29 C.F.R. §§ 541.100, 541.601(a), (b)(1).1 That rule considers employees to be executives when they are compensated on a salary basis (salary-basis test), at a rate of not less than $455 per week (salary-level test), and carry out three listed responsibilities —managing the enterprise, directing other employees, and exercising power to hire and fire (duties test). § 541.100(a). A different rule—the one applicable here— addresses employees making at least $100,000 per year (again, including all forms of pay), who are labeled highly compensated employees. § 541.601. That rule—usually known as the HCE rule— amends only the duties test, while restating the other two. In the HCE rule, the duties test becomes easier to satisfy: An employee must regularly perform just one (not all) of the three responsibilities listed in the general rule. § 541.601(a), see 69 Fed. Reg. 22174 (2004) (explaining that the HCE rule uses a more flexible duties standard and thus leads to more exemptions). But the salary-basis and salary-level tests carry over from the general rule to the HCE rule in identical form. The HCE rule too states that an employee can count as an executive (and thus lose the FLSA's protections) only if he receives at least $455 per week paid on a salary  basis. § 541.601(b)(1).",Kagan,0,
2022-008,37,"Two other regulations give content to the salary-basis test at the heart of this case. (After giving full citations, we refer to them simply as § 602(a) and § 604(b).) The main salary-basis provision, set out in two sentences of § 541.602(a), states:",Kagan,0,
2022-008,38,"An employee will be considered to be paid on a `salary basis'  if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. Subject to certain exceptions, an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,39,"The rule thus ensures that the employee will get at least part of his compensation through a preset weekly (or less frequent) salary, not subject to reduction because of exactly how many days he worked.

Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,40,"Another provision, § 541.604(b), focuses on workers whose compensation is computed on an hourly, a daily or a shift basis, rather than a weekly or less frequent one. That section states that an employer may base an employee's pay on an hourly, daily, or shift rate without violating the salary basis requirement or losing the bona fide executive exemption so long as two conditions are met. First, the employer must also guarantee the employee at least $455 each week (the minimum salary level) regardless of the number of hours, days or shifts worked. Ibid. And second, that promised amount must bear a reasonable relationship to the amount actually earned in a typical week—more specifically, must be roughly equivalent to the employee's usual earnings at the assigned hourly, daily or shift rate for the employee's normal scheduled workweek. Ibid. Those conditions create a compensation system functioning much like a true salary—a steady stream of pay, which the employer cannot much vary and the employee may thus rely on week after week.

His paycheck, issued every two weeks, amounted to his daily rate times the number of days he had worked in the pay period. So if Hewitt had worked only one day, his paycheck would total (at the range's low end) $963, but if he had worked all 14 days, his paycheck would come to $13,482. Under that compensation scheme, Helix paid Hewitt over $200,000 annually.",Kagan,0,

2022-008,48,"The critical question here is whether Hewitt was paid on a salary basis under § 602(a) of the Secretary's regulations. Indeed, the parties have taken all other issues off the table. They agree that Hewitt was exempt from the FLSA only if he was a bona fide executive. They agree, as they must, that under the regulations, a high-income employee like Hewitt counts as an executive when (but only when) he is paid on a salary basis, the salary paid is at or above the requisite level ($455 per week), and he performs at least one listed duty. See § 541.601, supra, at 683-684.2 In denying executive status, Hewitt puts all his chips on that standard's first part: He argues only that he was not paid on a salary basis. See Brief for Respondent i-ii, 1. Helix then narrows the issues still further. As described above, a worker may be paid on a salary basis under either § 602(a) or § 604(b). See supra, at 683-684. But Helix acknowledges that Hewitt's compensation did not satisfy § 604(b)'s conditions. That is because Helix did not guarantee that Hewitt would receive each week an amount (above $455) bearing a reasonable relationship to the weekly amount he usually earned. See Brief for Petitioners 28, supra, at 684-685. So again, everything turns on whether Helix paid Hewitt on a salary basis as described in § 602(a). If yes, Hewitt was exempt from the FLSA and not entitled to overtime pay, if no, he was covered under the statute and can claim that extra money.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,49,"The answer is no: Helix did not pay Hewitt on a salary basis as defined in § 602(a). That section applies solely to employees paid by the week (or longer), it is not met when an employer pays an employee by the day, as Helix paid Hewitt. Daily-rate workers, of whatever income level, are paid on a salary basis only through the test set out in § 604(b) (which, again, Helix's payment scheme did not satisfy). Those conclusions follow from both the text and the structure of the regulations. And Helix's various policy claims cannot justify departing from what the rules say.3  A",Kagan,0,
2022-008,50,"Consider again § 602(a)'s text, focusing on how it excludes daily-rate workers. An employee, the regulation says, is paid on a salary basis if but only if he receives the full salary for any week in which he performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked. To break that up just a bit: Whenever an employee works at all in a week, he must get his full salary for that week—what § 602(a)'s prior sentence calls the predetermined amount. That amount must be without regard to the number of days or hours worked—or as the prior sentence says, it is not subject to reduction because the employee worked less than the full week. Nothing in that description fits a daily-rate worker, who by definition is paid for each day he works and no others. Suppose (to approximate the compensation scheme here) such a worker is paid $1,000 each day, and usually works seven days a week, for a total of $7,000. Now suppose he is ill and works just one day in a week, for a total of $1,000. Is that lesser amount (as Helix argues) a predetermined, full salary for the week—or is it just one day's pay out of the usual seven? Has the amount been paid without regard to the number of days he worked—or precisely with regard to that number? If ordinary language bears ordinary meaning, the answer to those questions is: the latter. A daily-rate worker's weekly pay is always a function of how many days he has labored. It can be calculated only by counting those days once the week is over—not, as § 602(a) requires, by ignoring that number and paying a predetermined amount.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,51,"In demanding that an employee receive a fixed amount for a week no matter how many days he has worked, § 602(a) embodies the standard meaning of the word salary. At the time the salary-basis test came into effect, just as today, a salary referred to fixed compensation regularly paid, as by the year, quarter, month, or week. Webster's New International Dictionary 2203 (2d ed. 1949), see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2003 (2002) (similar). Salary was thus often distinguished from wages, which denoted pay given for labor at short stated intervals. Webster's New International Dictionary, at 2203, 2863. As the Court of Appeals put the point, the concept of `salary' is linked, as a matter of common parlance, to the stability and security of a regular weekly, monthly, or annual pay structure. 15 F.4th at 291. Take away that kind of paycheck security and the idea of a salary also dissolves. A worker paid by the day or hour—docked for time he takes off and uncompensated for time he is not needed—is usually understood as a daily or hourly wage earner, not a salaried employee.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,52,"So in excluding those workers— once again, because they do not receive a preset weekly salary regardless of the number of days worked—the salary-basis test just reflects what people ordinarily think being salaried means.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,53,"Helix primarily responds by invoking § 602(a)'s statement that an employee (to be salaried) must receive each pay period on a weekly or less frequent basis a preset and non-reducible sum. At first glance (and actually, see below, on second too), that language just confirms everything already shown: An employee must be paid on a weekly or biweekly or monthly basis, not on a daily or hourly one. Or said more fully, the basis in that phrase is the unit of time used to calculate pay, and that unit must be a week or less frequent measure, it cannot be a day, or other more frequent measure, as it was for Hewitt. See Webster's New International Dictionary, at 225, 227 (defining basis and base as the foundation of a thing, thus, a price used as a unit from which to calculate other prices). But Helix contends that the single word receives converts § 602(a)'s focus: In saying that an employee must receive a fixed amount on a weekly or less frequent basis, the provision mandates only that he get his paycheck no more often than once a week (which of course most employees do). See Brief for Petitioners 26. Because Hewitt's paycheck came every two weeks, and because that check always contained pay exceeding $455 (the salary level) for any week he had worked at all, Helix concludes that Hewitt was paid, under § 602(a), on a salary basis. See ibid.4",Kagan,0,
2022-008,54,"But that interpretation of the weekly basis phrase—even putting § 602(a)'s other language to the side—is not the most natural one. As just suggested, a basis of payment typically refers to the unit or method for calculating pay, not the frequency of its distribution. Most simply put, an employee paid on an hourly basis is paid by the hour, an employee paid on a daily basis is paid by the day, and an employee paid on a weekly basis is paid by the week—irrespective of when or how often his employer actually doles out the money. The inclusion of the word receives in § 602(a) does not change that usual meaning. Suppose a lawyer tells a client that she wishes to receive her pay on an hourly basis. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22-24. The client would understand that the lawyer is proposing an hourly billable rate, not delivery of a paycheck every hour. Or consider a nurse who says she gets paid on a daily basis. She means that she receives compensation only for the days she works—not that she collects a paycheck every day. So too here, an employee receives compensation on a weekly —as opposed to a daily or hourly—basis, as § 602(a) demands, when he gets paid a weekly rate. The provision's temporal dividing line is not about paycheck frequency.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,55,"Our reading of § 602(a) also tracks how neighboring regulations use the term basis of payment. Over and over in the Secretary's rules, that term means the unit or method used to calculate earnings. So, for example, one provision states that additional compensation may be paid on any basis (e.g., flat sum, bonus payment or straight-time hourly amount). § 541.604(a). Another provision defines what it means to be paid on a `fee basis,' differentiating that method from payments  based on the number of hours or days worked. § 541.605(a). Still another says that for one class of employees, the salary-level test may be met by compensation on an hourly basis of not less than $27.63 an hour. § 541.600(d). And as discussed below, § 604(b) refers to earnings computed on an hourly, a daily or a shift basis as distinct from amounts paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours, days or shifts worked. For now, the point is simply that all those regulations use the language of basis in a similar vein—to describe the unit used to determine payment. And consistent with that usage, § 602(a)'s demand that a salaried worker get a preset, fixed amount on a weekly or less frequent basis means that his paycheck reflects how many weeks—not days or hours—he has worked.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,56,"The weekly basis phrase thus works hand in hand with the rest of § 602(a). Every part of the provision describes those paid a weekly rate, rather than a daily or hourly one. Recall that an employee, to meet the salary-basis test, must receive his full salary for any week in which he works at all. That predetermined amount cannot be changed because of the number of days or hours an employee actually labors. The amount must instead be paid without regard to that number. Or said otherwise, the amount must be paid on a weekly basis —again, by the week, not by the day or hour. All that regulatory language—each phrase adding onto and reinforcing the others—reflects the standard meaning of a salary, which connotes a steady and predictable stream of pay, week after week after week. Put it all together and a daily-rate worker does not qualify under § 602(a) as a salaried employee—even if (like Hewitt) his daily rate is high.5",Kagan,0,
2022-008,58,"The broader regulatory structure —in particular, the role of § 604(b)— confirms our reading of § 602(a). Recall that § 604(b) lays out a second path—  apart from § 602(a)—enabling a compensation scheme to meet the salary-basis requirement. See supra, at 683-684. And that second route is all about daily, hourly, or shift rates. Whereas § 602(a) addresses payments on a weekly or less frequent basis, § 604(b) concerns payments on an hourly, a daily or a shift basis. An employee's earnings, § 604(b) provides, may be computed on those shorter bases without violating the salary basis requirement so long as an employer also provides a guarantee of weekly payment approximating what the employee usually earns. See supra, at 683-684. Section 604(b) thus speaks directly to when daily and hourly rates are consistent with the salary basis concept. 69 Fed. Reg. 22184, see supra, at 684. And by doing so, the provision reinforces the exclusion of those shorter rates from § 602(a)'s domain. Were § 602(a) also to cover daily- and hourly-rate employees, it would subvert § 604(b)'s strict conditions on when their pay counts as a salary. By contrast, when § 602(a) is limited to weekly-rate employees, it works in tandem with § 604(b). The two then offer non-overlapping paths to satisfy the salary-basis requirement, with § 604(b) taking over where § 602(a) leaves off.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,59,"Helix's argument to the contrary relies on carting § 604(b) off the stage. (So too the principal dissent's, see post, at 694-695 —so we do not describe separately why that opinion is wrong.) True enough, Helix says, that § 604(b) usually provides an alternative route for meeting the salary-basis requirement. See Brief for Petitioners 9-11, 46. But that is not so, Helix asserts, when highly compensated employees like Hewitt are involved. Recall that the Secretary's regulations separately prescribe—in the general rule and the HCE rule—how lower- and higher-income employees satisfy the three-part standard for bona fide executive status. See supra, at 683-684. On Helix's view, only the general rule (for lower-income workers) has two different avenues—§ 602(a) and § 604(b)—for meeting the salary-basis test. The HCE rule, Helix argues, incorporates only § 602(a), it is independent of § 604(b). See Brief for Petitioners 28 (The separate requirements of § 604 do not apply to the HCE regulation). And with § 604(b) out of the way, Helix does not have to confront (or so it says) the argument above—that it is anomalous to read § 602(a) as covering daily-rate workers when that is § 604(b)'s explicit function.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,60,"But to begin with, Helix could not succeed even if it were right about the (supposedly nonexistent) relationship between the HCE rule and § 604(b). That is so for two reasons. First, even without support from § 604(b), the plain text of § 602(a) excludes daily-rate workers like Hewitt, for all the reasons given in Part II-A. See supra, at 685-688. And Helix of course acknowledges that it must comply with § 602(a) to satisfy the HCE rule's salary-basis requirement. See supra, at 685. Second, even on Helix's view of the HCE rule, § 604(b) in fact confirms the plain-text, weekly-rate-only reading of § 602(a). Helix, after all, agrees that both provisions serve as pathways to meeting the salary-basis test when the general rule (for lower-income workers) is involved. See supra, at 689. And if in that context (as just shown) § 604(b) confirms that § 602(a) applies only to weekly-rate employees, then the same must be true in the HCE context. For § 602(a) cannot change meanings depending on whether it applies to the general rule or the HCE rule. It applies to both, and must mean the same thing in either context. So even supposing that the HCE rule incorporates only § 602(a), and not § 604(b), the two provisions still must be read to complement each other.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,61,"In any event, Helix is wrong that the HCE rule operates independently of § 604(b). The HCE rule refers to the salary-basis (and salary-level) requirement in the same way that the general rule does. Compare § 541.601(b)(1) (requiring at least $455 per week paid on a salary or fee basis) with § 541.100(a)(1) (requiring payment on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week). And as already described, the two provisions giving content to that requirement—explaining when a person is indeed paid on a salary basis— are § 602(a) and § 604(b). See supra, at 683-684, 688-689. So both those provisions should apply to both the general and the HCE rule—because both the former serve to define what both the latter identically require. Helix tries to avoid that reasoning by noting that a later version of the HCE rule than the one governing this case cross-references § 602(a) but not § 604(b). See Brief for Petitioners 29-30, and n. 7. But that version is concededly not the rule at issue—which contains cross-references to neither provision, so offers no basis for Helix's distinction. And anyhow, Helix's own arguments belie the import of the added cross-reference. The general rule, in both its earlier and its later versions, also cross-references § 602(a) but not § 604(b)—yet Helix acknowledges that both those provisions apply in that (lower-income) context. See id., at 9-11, 46. There is no reason to give different meaning to the same cross-reference scheme in the later HCE rule. The upshot is that § 604(b) applies, just as § 602(a) does, to the HCE and general rules alike.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,62,"There is of course a difference between the HCE and general rules, it just has nothing to do with the salary-basis requirement. As Helix notes, the HCE rule is streamlined as compared to the one for lower-income workers. See id., at 12, 29. But the HCE rule's text makes clear what it is streamlined with respect to. Not salary basis, which (as just shown) is described identically for higher- and lower-income workers. Nor salary level, which is set at $455 per week for both groups. Rather, the difference is with respect to workplace duties. As noted above, lower-income employees cannot qualify as bona fide executives unless (1) their primary job is management, (2) they regularly direct the work of others, and (3) they have authority to hire and fire. See § 541.100(a), supra, at 682-683. But higher-income employees need regularly perform only one of those responsibilities to so qualify. See § 541.601(a). That more flexible duties standard eases the way to executive status, and so to exemption from the FLSA. 69 Fed. Reg. 22174. But the HCE rule's streamlining stops at that point. Again, the rule leaves untouched the salary-basis requirement—so incorporates § 604(b) as well as § 602(a). And § 604(b)'s focus on daily and hourly workers confirms that § 602(a)—as its own text shows—pertains only to employees paid by the week (or longer). Hewitt was not.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,64,"Our reading of the relevant regulations, as laid out above, properly concludes this case. Helix urges us to consider the policy consequences of that reading, labeling them far-reaching and deleterious. Reply Brief 24. In Helix's view, holding that § 602(a)'s salary-basis test never captures daily-rate workers will give windfalls to high earners, disrupt and increase costs of industry operations, and impose significant retroactive liability. Id., at 24, 26, Brief for Petitioners 48. But as this Court has explained, even the most formidable policy arguments cannot overcome a clear textual directive. BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1532,  1541-1542, 209 L.Ed.2d 631 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). And anyway, Helix's appeal to consequences appears something less than formidable in the context of the FLSA's regulatory scheme. Indeed, it is Helix's own position that, if injected into that plan, would produce troubling outcomes—because it would deny overtime pay even to daily-rate employees making far less money than Hewitt.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,65,"Initially, Helix's complaint about windfalls for high earners fails in view of what this Court has observed about the FLSA: Workers are not deprived of the benefits of the Act simply because they are well paid. Jewell Ridge, 325 U.S. at 167, 65 S.Ct. 1063 (explaining that the FLSA's breadth fits its aims of deterring overwork and spreading employment), see supra, at 682. The Secretary of Labor has often reiterated that point, recognizing since the FLSA's enactment that Congress elected not to exempt all well-compensated workers. See, e.g., 69 Fed. Reg. 22173, see also 15 F.4th at 290 (case below) (Congress has repeatedly rejected efforts to categorically exempt all highly paid employees from overtime requirements). That statutory choice undergirds how the HCE rule works. The rule spells out when higher-income employees like Hewitt are exempt from the FLSA (because they are bona fide executives), but so too, it establishes when those workers are covered (because they are not). In thus carving up the class of higher-income workers, the salary-basis requirement is hardly unique. Another provision of the HCE rule states, for example, that various workers in maintenance, construction and similar occupations are never exempt as executives, no matter how highly paid they might be. § 541.601(d). Throughout, the HCE rule reflects the statutory choice not to set a simple income level as the test for exemption. Some might have made a different choice, but that cannot affect what this Court decides.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,66,"Nor do Helix's operational and cost-based objections move the needle. Helix could come into compliance with the salary-basis requirement for Hewitt and similar employees in either of two ways. It could add to Hewitt's per-day rate a weekly guarantee that satisfies § 604(b)'s conditions. Or it could convert Hewitt's compensation to a straight weekly salary for time he spends on the rig. Helix protests that either option would make it pay for days Hewitt has not worked. See Reply Brief 25-26. But that is just to say that Helix wishes neither to pay employees a true salary nor to pay them overtime. And the whole point of the salary-basis requirement is to take that third option off the table, even though doing so may well increase costs. Of course, were that requirement novel, Helix's complaint about retroactive liability could have force. See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 155-157, 132 S.Ct. 2156, 183 L.Ed.2d 153 (2012). But as described above, the salary-basis test, in largely the form it exists today, goes back to nearly the FLSA's beginnings. See supra, at 682-683, 686. And the governing regulations—both § 602(a) and § 604(b)— make clear what that test means for a daily-rate worker like Hewitt: Because he is not paid on a salary basis, he is entitled to overtime compensation. So as the Court of Appeals remarked, nothing about today's decision should come as a surprise. 15 F.4th at 296.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,67,"It is in fact Helix's position that would create disturbing consequences, by depriving even workers at the heartland of the FLSA's protection—those paid less than $100,000 annually—of overtime pay. The problem arises because, as explained above, § 602(a) applies not only to the HCE rule but also to the general rule,  exempting lower-earning employees as bona fide executives. See supra, at 683-684, 689. And § 602(a) must mean the same thing as applied to both rules, not even Helix argues otherwise. So on Helix's view, any daily-rate employee who meets the general rule's three-part duties test, gets a paycheck no more frequently than every week, and receives at least $455 per week (about $24,000 per year) is excluded from the FLSA's overtime protections. See § 541.100, § 602(a), Brief for Petitioners 26-27, 37. It is unclear how many, and what kinds of, employees are in that group, given the relative strictness of the general rule's duties test. But, for example, two organizations representing nurses have filed amicus briefs here, and it is easy to see why. See Brief for National Nurses United as Amicus Curiae, Brief for Massachusetts Nurses Association as Amicus Curiae. Some nurses working on a per-day or per-shift basis are likely to meet the general rule's duties test, and their employers would assure them $455 per week in a heartbeat if doing so eliminated the need to pay overtime. And nurses, in the Government's view, are not alone: They are just one of the many examples of workers paid less than $100,000 a year who would, if Helix prevailed, lose their entitlement to overtime compensation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 95-96. That consequence, unlike the ones Helix raises, is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the FLSA's design.",Kagan,0,
2022-008,69,"A daily-rate employee like Hewitt is not paid on a salary basis under § 602(a) of the Secretary's regulations. He may qualify as paid on salary only under § 604(b). Because Hewitt's compensation did not meet § 604(b)'s conditions, it could not count as a salary. So Hewitt was not exempt from the FLSA, instead, he was eligible under that statute for overtime pay.

2022-008,73,"Unfortunately, this case does not tee up that issue in the way we hoped. With the benefit of briefing and argument, it has become clear that the critical question here is not how § 541.601 and § 541.604 interact. Ante, at 685. Instead, the critical question is an antecedent one—whether Helix Energy paid Michael Hewitt, the supervisor at issue in this case, on a salary basis under § 541.602. As the Court explains, the proper interaction between § 541.601 and § 541.604 matters only if Helix Energy paid Mr. Hewitt on a salary basis consistent with the terms of § 541.602. Ante, at 685.

2022-008,74,"Respectfully, I would dismiss this case as improvidently granted. After successfully petitioning the Court to decide how § 541.601 relates to § 541.604, Helix Energy assured us that the flaw in the decision  below has nothing to do with the salary-basis test in § 541.602. Brief for Petitioners 27. I might excuse that disclaimer as a mere rhetorical flourish if Helix Energy's briefing nonetheless made clear the importance of § 541.602 to this case.

Understandably, the Court refuses to entertain this larger statutory argument because Helix Energy failed to raise it earlier in the litigation. Ante, at 685, n. 2.

2022-008,77,"Michael Hewitt earned about $200,000 per year as a supervisor for Helix, a firm that provides services on offshore oil rigs. After being fired, Hewitt sued Helix under the Fair Labor Standards Act and sought hundreds of thousands of dollars in retroactive overtime pay. The Court today rules for Hewitt. I respectfully dissent. Unlike the Court, I would hold that Hewitt was a bona fide executive for Helix and therefore not entitled to overtime pay.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,78,"Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, many American workers are legally entitled to overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours per week. But the Act contains several exceptions, including an exception for employees who work in a bona fide executive  capacity. 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1). To determine whether an employee works in a bona fide executive capacity, the Department of Labor's implementing regulations look to, among other things, (i) the employee's duties, (ii) how much the employee is paid, and (iii) how the employee is paid—for example, by salary, wage, commission, or bonus.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,79,"Under the regulations, an employee who performs executive duties and earns at least $100,000 per year with a predetermined weekly salary of at least $455 for any week that he works is a bona fide executive and not entitled to overtime pay. 29 C.F.R. §§ 541.601, 541.602 (2015).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,80,"Per those regulations, Hewitt readily qualified as a bona fide executive. As everyone agrees, Hewitt performed executive duties, earned about $200,000 per year, and received a predetermined salary of at least $963 per week for any week that he worked.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,81,"Despite all that, the Court holds that Hewitt was not a bona fide executive and therefore was entitled to overtime pay under the regulations. The Court relies on two alternative rationales.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,82,"First, the Court reasons that Hewitt's pay was calculated on a daily-rate basis, while § 602 of the regulations requires a certain minimum predetermined amount calculated on a weekly or less frequent basis—specifically at least $455 per week. That is known as the salary-basis test. But Hewitt's daily predetermined rate ($963 per day) was higher than the weekly minimum requirement of $455 per week specified in the regulations. If a worker is guaranteed at least $455 for any day that he works, that worker by definition is guaranteed at least $455 for any week that he works. As Helix rightly explains, a supervisor whose pay is calculated based on a day rate above the weekly minimum receives more than enough on a salary basis to satisfy the regulation. Reply Brief 7.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,83,"To be sure, if Hewitt worked multiple days in a week, then his $963 guaranteed weekly salary would only be part of his total weekly compensation. But under the salary-basis test specified in the regulations, an employee's guaranteed weekly salary of at least $455 need only constitute all or part of his total weekly compensation. § 541.602(a) (emphasis added).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,84,"The Court's opinion never satisfactorily accounts for § 602's use of the phrase or part. Stated simply, the regulations require only that an employee be guaranteed a predetermined amount of at least $455 per week as part of his total compensation for any week that he works. Ibid. Hewitt was guaranteed a predetermined amount of at least $455 per week (in fact, $963 per week) as part of his total compensation for any week that he worked. And that predetermined minimum amount of $963 was not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. Ibid. Hewitt always received at least $963 per week that he worked.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,85,"Of course, this case would be different if Hewitt had been guaranteed, say, only $250 per day that he worked. Under those circumstances, Hewitt would not have been guaranteed at least $455 for any week that he worked. But here, Hewitt was guaranteed $963 for any day that he worked. Therefore, he was guaranteed at least $963 for any week that he worked.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,86,The Court's contrary conclusion boils down to the head-scratching assertion that Hewitt was somehow not guaranteed to receive at least $455 for any week that he worked even though (as all agree) he was in fact guaranteed to receive $963 for any day that he worked.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,87,"Second, and alternatively, the Court relies on a separate section of the regulations— § 604—that applies to executives who (unlike Hewitt) make less than $100,000 per year.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,88,"Under the overtime-pay regulations, as I have noted, executives who earn at least $100,000 per year and who are guaranteed a salary of at least $455 per week that they work are not entitled to overtime pay. § 541.601. Under § 604, some executives who make less than $100,000 per year are likewise not entitled to overtime pay if they are guaranteed at least $455 per week that they work and at least two-thirds of their total compensation comes in the form of a weekly guarantee.

The Court's opinion nonetheless suggests that the two-thirds requirement may apply even to executives such as Hewitt who earn more than $100,000 per year. That is incorrect. To begin with, the introductory  statement to the overtime regulations indicates that the two-thirds requirement does not apply to highly compensated employees —that is, those like Hewitt who earn at least $100,000 per year. See § 541.0. Moreover, the regulation for highly compensated employees (§ 601) does not refer to or incorporate § 604, which contains the two-thirds requirement, whereas § 601 now does refer to other provisions of the regulations. 29 C.F.R. § 541.601(b)(1) (2020). In addition, the regulation for highly compensated employees (§ 601) expressly authorizes an employer to make a catch-up payment to an employee near a year's end in order to push the employee over the $100,000 per year threshold. That regulation simultaneously makes clear that, for such a highly compensated employee, only about $25,000 of his compensation needs to be guaranteed in weekly salary. That express authorization for significant catch-up payments directly contravenes any suggestion that highly compensated employees who earn at least $100,000 per year are subject to the two-thirds requirement. In short, § 604's two-thirds requirement did not apply to Hewitt, who earned about $200,000 per year.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,90,"To sum up, neither of the Court's two rationales holds up in light of the text of the regulations and the undisputed terms of Hewitt's pay. Because Hewitt performed executive duties, earned at least $100,000 per year, and received a guaranteed weekly salary of at least $455 for any week that he worked, I would hold that Hewitt was not legally entitled to overtime pay under the regulations.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-008,91,"One last point: Although the Court holds that Hewitt is entitled to overtime pay under the regulations, the regulations themselves may be inconsistent with the Fair Labor Standards Act. See, e.g., Brief for State of Mississippi et al. as Amici Curiae 7-10, Ante, at 692-693 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). Recall that the Act provides that employees who work in a bona fide executive  capacity are not entitled to overtime pay. 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1). The Act focuses on whether the employee performs executive duties, not how much an employee is paid or how an employee is paid. So it is questionable whether the Department's regulations— which look not only at an employee's duties but also at how much an employee is paid and how an employee is paid—will survive if and when the regulations are challenged as inconsistent with the Act. It is especially dubious for the regulations to focus on how an employee is paid (for example, by salary, wage, commission, or bonus) to determine whether the employee is a bona fide executive. An executive employee's duties (and perhaps his total compensation) may be relevant to assessing whether the employee is a bona fide executive. But I am hard-pressed to understand why it would matter for assessing executive status whether an employee is paid by salary, wage, commission, bonus, or some combination thereof. In any event, I would leave it to the Fifth Circuit on remand to determine whether Helix forfeited the statutory issue. But whether in Hewitt's case on remand or in another case, the statutory question remains open for future resolution in the lower courts and perhaps ultimately in this Court.",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-009,75,"In cases like these, where the plaintiff is an organization, the standing requirements of Article III can be satisfied in two ways.

2022-009,76,"Respondents do not contest that SFFA satisfies the three-part test for organizational standing articulated in Hunt, and like the courts below, we find no basis in the record to conclude otherwise.

Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 24. According to respondents, our decision in Hunt established that groups qualify as genuine membership organizations only if they are controlled and funded by their members. And because SFFA's members did neither at the time this litigation commenced, respondents' argument goes, SFFA could not represent its members for purposes of Article III standing.

2022-009,77,"Hunt involved the Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, a state agency whose purpose was to protect the local apple industry. The Commission brought suit challenging a North Carolina statute that imposed a labeling requirement on containers of apples sold in that State. The Commission argued that it had standing to challenge the requirement on behalf of Washington's apple industry. See id., at 336-341, 97 S.Ct. 2434. We recognized, however, that as a state agency, the Commission was not a traditional voluntary membership organization , for it had no members at all. Id., at 342, 97 S.Ct. 2434. As a result, we could not easily apply the three-part test for organizational standing, which asks whether an organization's members have standing. We nevertheless concluded that the Commission had standing because the apple growers and dealers it represented were effectively members of the Commission. Id., at 344, 97 S.Ct. 2434. The growers and dealers alone elected the members of the Commission, alone  served on the Commission, and alone financed its activities—they possessed, in other words, all of the indicia of membership.

Meanwhile in the UNC litigation, SFFA represented four members in particular—high school graduates who were denied admission to UNC. See 2018 DC Opinion 234.

Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 431 (1866) (statement of Rep. Bingham) (Cong. Globe).

2022-009,83,"Despite our early recognition of the broad sweep of the Equal Protection Clause, this Court—alongside the country —quickly failed to live up to the Clause's core commitments. For almost a century after the Civil War, state-mandated segregation was in many parts of the Nation a regrettable norm. This Court played its own role in that ignoble history, allowing in Plessy v. Ferguson the separate but equal regime that would come to deface much of America. 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896). The aspirations of the framers of the Equal Protection Clause, virtually strangled in their infancy, would remain for too long only that—aspirations. J.

2022-009,84,"After Plessy, American courts  labored with the doctrine of separate but equal for over half a century. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 491, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). Some cases  in this period attempted to curtail the perniciousness of the doctrine by emphasizing that it required States to provide black students educational opportunities equal to—even if formally separate from—those enjoyed by white students. See, e.g., Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337, 349-350, 59 S.Ct. 232, 83 L.Ed. 208 (1938) (The admissibility of laws separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the equality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups .). But the inherent folly of that approach —of trying to derive equality from inequality—soon became apparent. As the Court subsequently recognized, even racial distinctions that were argued to have no palpable effect worked to subordinate the afflicted students. See, e.g., McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Ed., 339 U.S. 637, 640-642, 70 S.Ct. 851, 94 L.Ed. 1149 (1950) (It is said that the separations imposed by the State in this case are in form merely nominal . But they signify that the State  sets petitioner apart from the other students.). By 1950, the inevitable truth of the Fourteenth Amendment had thus begun to reemerge: Separate cannot be equal.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,85,"The culmination of this approach came finally in Brown v. Board of Education. In that seminal decision, we overturned Plessy for good and set firmly on the path of invalidating all de jure racial discrimination by the States and Federal Government. 347 U.S. at 494-495, 74 S.Ct. 686. Brown concerned the permissibility of racial segregation in public schools. The school district maintained that such segregation was lawful because the schools provided to black students and white students were of roughly the same quality. But we held such segregation impermissible even though the physical facilities and other `tangible' factors may be equal. Id., at 493, 74 S.Ct. 686 (emphasis added). The mere act of separating children  because of their race, we explained, itself generated a feeling of inferiority. Id., at 494, 74 S.Ct. 686.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,86,"The conclusion reached by the Brown Court was thus unmistakably clear: the right to a public education must be made available to all on equal terms. Id., at 493, 74 S.Ct. 686. As the plaintiffs had argued, no State has any authority under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in affording educational opportunities among its citizens.

T. 1953, p. 65 (That the Constitution is color blind is our dedicated belief.), post, at 2197, n. 7 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The Court reiterated that rule just one year later, holding that full compliance with Brown required schools to admit students on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300-301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955). The time for making distinctions based on race had passed.

2022-009,87,"So too in other areas of life. Immediately after Brown, we began routinely affirming lower court decisions that invalidated all manner of race-based state action. In Gayle v. Browder, for example, we summarily affirmed a decision invalidating state and local laws that required segregation in busing. 352 U.S. 903, 77 S.Ct. 145, 1 L.Ed.2d 114 (1956) (per curiam). As the lower court explained, the equal protection clause requires equality of treatment  before the law for all persons without regard to race or color. Browder v. Gayle, 142 F.Supp. 707, 715 (MD Ala. 1956). And in Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Dawson, we summarily affirmed a decision striking down racial segregation at public beaches and bathhouses maintained by the State of Maryland and the city of Baltimore. 350 U.S. 877, 76 S.Ct. 133, 100 L.Ed. 774 (1955) (per curiam). It is obvious that racial segregation in recreational activities can no longer be sustained, the lower court observed. Dawson v.

Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 8, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967). Our cases had thus consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race.

2022-009,89,"These decisions reflect the core purpose of the Equal Protection Clause: doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race. Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984) (footnote omitted). We have recognized that repeatedly. The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States. Loving, 388 U.S. at 10, 87 S.Ct. 1817, see also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976) (The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.), McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 192, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222 (1964) (The historical fact is that the central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination.).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,90,"Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it. And the Equal Protection Clause, we have accordingly  held, applies without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality— it is universal in its application. Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 369, 6 S.Ct. 1064. For the guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color. Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 289-290, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal. Id., at 290, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,91,"Any exception to the Constitution's demand for equal protection must survive a daunting two-step examination known in our cases as strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995). Under that standard we ask, first, whether the racial classification is used to further compelling governmental interests. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003). Second, if so, we ask whether the government's use of race is narrowly tailored —meaning necessary—to achieve that interest. Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 311-312, 133 S.Ct. 2411, 186 L.Ed.2d 474 (2013) (Fisher I) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,92,"Outside the circumstances of these cases, our precedents have identified only two compelling interests that permit resort to race-based government action. One is remediating specific, identified instances of past discrimination that violated the Constitution or a statute. See, e.g., Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 720, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 168 L.Ed.2d 508 (2007), Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 909-910, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996), post, at 2186-2187, 2192-2193 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The second is avoiding imminent and serious risks to human safety in prisons, such as a race riot. See Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 512-513, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 160 L.Ed.2d 949 (2005).3",Roberts,0,
2022-009,93,"Our acceptance of race-based state action has been rare for a reason. Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 517, 120 S.Ct. 1044, 145 L.Ed.2d 1007  (2000) (quoting Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943)). That principle cannot be overridden except in the most extraordinary case.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,95,"These cases involve whether a university may make admissions decisions that turn on an applicant's race. Our Court first considered that issue in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, which involved a set-aside admissions program used by the University of California, Davis, medical school. 438 U.S. at 272-276, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Each year, the school held 16 of its 100 seats open for members of certain minority groups, who were reviewed on a special admissions track separate from those in the main admissions pool. Id., at 272-275, 98 S.Ct. 2733. The plaintiff, Allan Bakke, was denied admission two years in a row, despite the admission of minority applicants with lower grade point averages and MCAT scores. Id., at 276-277, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Bakke subsequently sued the school, arguing that its set-aside program violated the Equal Protection Clause.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,96,"In a deeply splintered decision that produced six different opinions—none of which commanded a majority of the Court—we ultimately ruled in part in favor of the school and in part in favor of Bakke. Justice Powell announced the Court's judgment, and his opinion—though written for himself alone—would eventually come to serve as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 323, 123 S.Ct. 2325.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,97,"Justice Powell began by finding three of the school's four justifications for its policy not sufficiently compelling. The school's first justification of reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools, he wrote, was akin to preferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 306-307, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet that was discrimination for its own sake, which the Constitution forbids. Id., at 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (citing, inter alia, Loving, 388 U.S. at 11, 87 S.Ct. 1817). Justice Powell next observed that the goal of remedying  the effects of `societal discrimination' was also insufficient because it was an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Finally, Justice Powell found there was virtually no evidence in the record indicating that the school's special admissions program would, as the school had argued, increase the number of doctors working in underserved areas. Id., at 310, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,98,"Justice Powell then turned to the school's last interest asserted to be compelling —obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a racially diverse student body. That interest, in his view, was a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education. Id., at 311-312, 98 S.Ct. 2733. And that was so, he opined, because a university was entitled as a matter of academic freedom to make its own judgments as to  the selection of its student body. Id., at 312, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,99,"But a university's freedom was not unlimited. Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect, Justice Powell explained, and antipathy toward them was deeply rooted in our Nation's constitutional and demographic history. Id., at 291, 98 S.Ct. 2733. A university could not employ a quota system, for example, reserving a specified number of seats in each class for individuals from the preferred ethnic groups. Id., at 315, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Nor could it impose a multitrack  program with a prescribed number of seats set aside for each identifiable category of applicants. Ibid. And neither still could it use race to foreclose an individual from all consideration  simply because he was not the right color. Id., at 318, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,100,"The role of race had to be cabined. It could operate only as a `plus' in a particular applicant's file. Id., at 317, 98 S.Ct. 2733. And even then, race was to be weighed in a manner flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant. Ibid. Justice Powell derived this approach from what he called the illuminating example of the admissions system then used by Harvard College. Id., at 316, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Under that system, as described by Harvard in a brief it had filed with the Court, the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life experience may tip the balance in other candidates' cases. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Harvard continued: A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The result, Harvard proclaimed, was that race has been—and should be—a factor in some admission decisions. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,101,"No other Member of the Court joined Justice Powell's opinion. Four Justices instead would have held that the government may use race for the purpose of remedying the effects of past societal discrimination. Id., at 362, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Four other Justices, meanwhile, would have struck down the Davis program as violative of Title VI. In their view, it seemed clear that the proponents of Title VI assumed that the Constitution itself required a colorblind standard on the part of government. Id., at 416, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Davis program therefore flatly contravened a core principle imbedded in the constitutional and moral understanding of the times: the prohibition against racial discrimination. Id., at 418, n. 21, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,103,"In the years that followed our fractured decision in Bakke, lower courts struggled to discern whether Justice Powell's opinion constituted binding precedent. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 325, 123 S.Ct. 2325. We accordingly took up the matter again in 2003, in the case Grutter v. Bollinger, which concerned the admissions system used by the University of Michigan law school. Id., at 311, 123 S.Ct. 2325. There, in another sharply divided decision, the Court for the first time endorsed Justice Powell's view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions. Id., at 325, 123 S.Ct. 2325.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,104,"The Court's analysis tracked Justice Powell's in many respects. As for compelling interest, the Court held that the Law School's educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer. Id., at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325. In achieving that goal, however, the Court made clear—just as Justice Powell had—that the law school was limited in the means that it could pursue. The school could not establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on  separate admissions tracks. Id., at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Neither could it insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission. Ibid. Nor still could it desire some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin. Id., at 329-330, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (opinion of Powell, J.)).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,105,"These limits, Grutter explained, were intended to guard against two dangers that all race-based government action portends. The first is the risk that the use of race will devolve into illegitimate  stereotyping. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (plurality opinion). Universities were thus not permitted to operate their admissions programs on the belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks omitted). The second risk is that race would be used not as a plus, but as a negative—to discriminate against those racial groups that were not the beneficiaries of the race-based preference. A university's use of race, accordingly, could not occur in a manner that unduly harmed nonminority applicants. Id., at 341, 123 S.Ct. 2325.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,106,"But even with these constraints in place, Grutter expressed marked discomfort with the use of race in college admissions. The Court stressed the fundamental principle that there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of racial preference itself. Ibid. (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (opinion of Powell, J.)). It observed that all racial classifications, however compelling their goals, were dangerous. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325. And it cautioned that all race-based governmental action should remain subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit. Id., at 341, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,107,"To manage these concerns, Grutter imposed one final limit on race-based admissions programs. At some point, the Court held, they must end. Id., at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325. This requirement was critical, and Grutter emphasized it repeatedly. All race-conscious admissions programs must have a termination point, they must have reasonable durational limits, they must be limited in time, they must have sunset provisions, they must have a logical end point, their deviation from the norm of equal treatment must be a temporary matter. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The importance of an end point was not just a matter of repetition. It was the reason the Court was willing to dispense temporarily with the Constitution's unambiguous guarantee of equal protection. The Court recognized as much: enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences, the Court explained, would offend this fundamental equal protection principle. Ibid., see also id., at 342-343, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting N. Nathanson & C. Bartnik, The Constitutionality of Preferential Treatment for Minority Applicants to Professional Schools, 58 Chi. Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May-June 1977), for the proposition that it would be a sad day indeed, were America to become a quota-ridden society, with each identifiable minority assigned proportional representation in every desirable walk of life).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,108,"Grutter thus concluded with the following caution: It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education . We expect that 25 years  from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today. 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,110,"Twenty years later, no end is in sight. Harvard's view about when race-based admissions will end doesn't have a date on it. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20-1199, p. 85, Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, p. 52. Neither does UNC's. 567 F.Supp.3d at 612. Yet both insist that the use of race in their admissions programs must continue.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,111,"But we have permitted race-based admissions only within the confines of narrow restrictions. University programs must comply with strict scrutiny, they may never use race as a stereotype or negative, and—at some point—they must end. Respondents' admissions systems—however well intentioned and implemented in good faith—fail each of these criteria. They must therefore be invalidated under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.4",Roberts,0,
2022-009,113,"Because racial discrimination is invidious in all contexts, Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 619, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991), we have required that universities operate their race-based admissions programs in a manner that is sufficiently measurable to permit judicial review under the rubric of strict scrutiny, Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin, 579 U.S. 365, 381, 136 S.Ct. 2198, 195 L.Ed.2d 511 (2016) (Fisher II). Classifying and assigning students based on their race requires more than  an amorphous end to justify it. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 735, 127 S.Ct. 2738.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,114,"Respondents have fallen short of satisfying that burden. First, the interests they view as compelling cannot be subjected to meaningful judicial review. Harvard identifies the following educational benefits that it is pursuing: (1) training future leaders in the public and private sectors, (2) preparing graduates to adapt to an increasingly pluralistic society, (3) better educating its students through diversity, and (4) producing new knowledge stemming from diverse outlooks. 980 F.3d at 173-174. UNC points to similar benefits, namely, (1) promoting the robust exchange of ideas, (2) broadening and refining understanding, (3) fostering innovation and problem-solving, (4) preparing engaged and productive citizens and leaders, and (5) enhancing appreciation, respect, and empathy, cross-racial understanding, and breaking down stereotypes. 567 F.Supp.3d at 656.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,115,"Although these are commendable goals, they are not sufficiently coherent for purposes of strict scrutiny. At the outset, it is unclear how courts are supposed to measure any of these goals. How is a court to know whether leaders have been adequately trained, whether the exchange of ideas is robust, or whether new knowledge is being developed? Ibid., 980 F.3d at 173-174. Even if these goals could somehow be measured, moreover, how is a court to know when they have been reached, and when the perilous remedy of racial preferences may cease? There is no particular point at which there exists sufficient innovation and problem-solving, or  students who are appropriately engaged and productive. 567 F.Supp.3d at 656. Finally, the question in this context is not one of no diversity or of some: it is a question of degree. How many fewer leaders Harvard would create without racial preferences, or how much poorer the education at Harvard would be, are inquiries no court could resolve.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,116,"Comparing respondents' asserted goals to interests we have recognized as compelling further illustrates their elusive nature. In the context of racial violence in a prison, for example, courts can ask whether temporary racial segregation of inmates will prevent harm to those in the prison. See Johnson, 543 U.S. at 512-513, 125 S.Ct. 1141. When it comes to workplace discrimination, courts can ask whether a race-based benefit makes members of the discriminated class whole for the injuries they suffered. Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 763, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). And in school segregation cases, courts can determine whether any race-based remedial action produces a distribution of students comparable to what it would have been in the absence of such constitutional violations. Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 420, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,117,"Nothing like that is possible when it comes to evaluating the interests respondents assert here. Unlike discerning whether a prisoner will be injured or whether an employee should receive backpay, the question whether a particular mix of minority students produces engaged and productive citizens, sufficiently enhances appreciation, respect, and empathy, or effectively trains future leaders is standardless. 567 F.Supp.3d at 656, 980 F.3d at 173-174. The interests that respondents seek, though plainly worthy, are inescapably imponderable.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,118,"Second, respondents' admissions programs fail to articulate a meaningful connection between the means they employ and the goals they pursue. To achieve the educational benefits of diversity, UNC works to avoid the underrepresentation of minority groups, 567 F.Supp.3d at 591-592, and n. 7, while Harvard likewise guards against inadvertent drop-offs in representation of certain minority groups from year to year, Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, at 16. To accomplish both of those goals, in turn, the universities measure the racial composition of their classes using the following categories: (1) Asian, (2) Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, (3) Hispanic, (4) White, (5) African-American, and (6) Native American. See, e.g., 397 F.Supp.3d at 137, 178, 3 App. in No. 20-1199, at 1278, 1280-1283, 3 App. in No. 21-707, at 1234-1241. It is far from evident, though, how assigning students to these racial categories and making admissions decisions based on them furthers the educational benefits that the universities claim to pursue.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,119,"For starters, the categories are themselves imprecise in many ways. Some of them are plainly overbroad: by grouping together all Asian students, for instance, respondents are apparently uninterested in whether South Asian or East Asian students are adequately represented, so long as there is enough of one to compensate for a lack of the other. Meanwhile other racial categories, such as Hispanic, are arbitrary or undefined. See, e.g., M. Lopez, J. Krogstad, & J. Passel, Pew Research Center, Who is Hispanic? (Sept. 15, 2022) (referencing the long history of changing labels and shifting categories reflecting evolving cultural norms about what it means to be Hispanic or Latino in the U. S. today). And still other  categories are underinclusive. When asked at oral argument how are applicants from Middle Eastern countries classified, such as Jordan, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, UNC's counsel responded, I do not know the answer to that question. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, p. 107, cf. post, at 2210-2211 (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (detailing the incoherent and irrational stereotypes that these racial categories further).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,120,"Indeed, the use of these opaque racial categories undermines, instead of promotes, respondents' goals. By focusing on underrepresentation, respondents would apparently prefer a class with 15% of students from Mexico over a class with 10% of students from several Latin American countries, simply because the former contains more Hispanic students than the latter. Yet it is hard to understand how a plan that could allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is `broadly diverse.' Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 724, 127 S.Ct. 2738 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 329, 123 S.Ct. 2325). And given the mismatch between the means respondents employ and the goals they seek, it is especially hard to understand how courts are supposed to scrutinize the admissions programs that respondents use.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,121,"The universities' main response to these criticisms is, essentially, trust us. None of the questions recited above need answering, they say, because universities are owed deference when using race to benefit some applicants but not others. Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is true that our cases have recognized a tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325. But we have been unmistakably clear that any deference must exist within constitutionally prescribed limits, ibid., and that deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Universities may define their missions as they see fit. The Constitution defines ours. Courts may not license separating students on the basis of race without an exceedingly persuasive justification that is measurable and concrete enough to permit judicial review. As this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed, racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification. Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 270, 123 S.Ct. 2411, 156 L.Ed.2d 257 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). The programs at issue here do not satisfy that standard.5",Roberts,0,
2022-009,123,The race-based admissions systems that respondents employ also fail to comply with the twin commands of the Equal Protection Clause that race may never be used as a negative and that it may not operate as a stereotype.,Roberts,0,
2022-009,124,"First, our cases have stressed that an individual's race may never be used against him in the admissions process. Here, however, the First Circuit found that Harvard's consideration of race has led to an 11.1% decrease in the number of Asian-Americans admitted to Harvard. 980 F.3d at 170, n. 29. And the District Court  observed that Harvard's policy of considering applicants' race  overall results in fewer Asian American and white students being admitted. 397 F.Supp.3d at 178.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,125,"Respondents nonetheless contend that an individual's race is never a negative factor in their admissions programs, but that assertion cannot withstand scrutiny. Harvard, for example, draws an analogy between race and other factors it considers in admission. While admissions officers may give a preference to applicants likely to excel in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, Harvard explains, that does not mean it is a `negative' not to excel at a musical instrument. Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, at 51. But on Harvard's logic, while it gives preferences to applicants with high grades and test scores, that does not mean it is a `negative' to be a student with lower grades and lower test scores. Ibid. This understanding of the admissions process is hard to take seriously. College admissions are zero-sum. A benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former group at the expense of the latter.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,126,"Respondents also suggest that race is not a negative factor because it does not impact many admissions decisions. See id., at 49, Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 2. Yet, at the same time, respondents also maintain that the demographics of their admitted classes would meaningfully change if race-based admissions were abandoned. And they acknowledge that race is determinative for at least some—if not many—of the students they admit. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20-1199, at 67, 567 F.Supp.3d at 633. How else but negative can race be described if, in its absence, members of some racial groups would be admitted in greater numbers than they otherwise would have been? The equal protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities. Shelley, 334 U.S. at 22, 68 S.Ct. 836.6",Roberts,0,
2022-009,127,"Respondents' admissions programs are infirm for a second reason as well. We have long held that universities may not operate their admissions programs on the belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks omitted). That requirement is found throughout our Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence more generally. See, e.g., Schuette v. BAMN, 572 U.S. 291, 308, 134 S.Ct. 1623, 188 L.Ed.2d 613 (2014) (plurality opinion) (In cautioning against `impermissible racial stereotypes,' this Court has rejected the assumption that `members of the same racial group—regardless of their age, education, economic status, or the community in which they live—think alike .'

2022-009,128,"Yet by accepting race-based admissions programs in which some students may obtain  preferences on the basis of race alone, respondents' programs tolerate the very thing that Grutter foreswore: stereotyping. The point of respondents' admissions programs is that there is an inherent benefit in race qua race—in race for race's sake. Respondents admit as much. Harvard's admissions process rests on the pernicious stereotype that a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (opinion of Powell, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20-1199, at 92. UNC is much the same.

2022-009,129,"We have time and again forcefully rejected the notion that government actors may intentionally allocate preference to those who may have little in common with one another but the color of their skin. Shaw, 509 U.S. at 647, 113 S.Ct. 2816. The entire point of the Equal Protection Clause is that treating someone differently because of their skin color is not like treating them differently because they are from a city or from a suburb, or because they play the violin poorly or well.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,130,"One of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities. Rice, 528 U.S. at 517, 120 S.Ct. 1044. But when a university admits students on the basis of race, it engages in the offensive and demeaning assumption that students of a particular race, because of their race, think alike, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 911-912, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted)—at the very least alike in the sense of being different from nonminority students. In doing so, the university furthers stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts—their very worth as citizens—according to a criterion barred to the Government by history and the Constitution. Id., at 912, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such stereotyping can only cause continued hurt and injury, Edmonson, 500 U.S. at 631, 111 S.Ct. 2077, contrary as it is to the core purpose of the Equal Protection Clause, Palmore, 466 U.S. at 432, 104 S.Ct. 1879.",Roberts,0,

2022-009,133,"Respondents and the Government first suggest that respondents' race-based admissions programs will end when, in their absence, there is meaningful representation and meaningful diversity on college campuses. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, at 167.

So what does it involve?",Roberts,0,

The University frames the challenge it faces as the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minorities, Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 7, a metric that turns solely on whether a group's percentage enrollment  within the undergraduate student body is lower than their percentage within the general population in North Carolina, 567 F.Supp.3d at 591, n. 7, see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, at 79. The University has not yet fully achieved its diversity-related educational goals, it explains, in part due to its failure to obtain closer to proportional representation. Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 7, see also 567 F.Supp.3d at 594.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,151,"The problem with these approaches is well established. Outright racial balancing is patently unconstitutional. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 311, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is so, we have repeatedly explained, because at the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class. Miller, 515 U.S. at 911, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (internal quotation marks omitted). By promising to terminate their use of race only when some rough percentage of various racial groups is admitted, respondents turn that principle on its head. Their admissions programs effectively assure that race will always be relevant  and that the ultimate goal of eliminating race as a criterion will never be achieved. Croson, 488 U.S. at 495, 109 S.Ct. 706 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,152,"Respondents' second proffered end point fares no better. Respondents assert that universities will no longer need to engage in race-based admissions when, in their absence, students nevertheless receive the educational benefits of diversity. But as we have already explained, it is not clear how a court is supposed to determine when stereotypes have broken down or productive citizens and leaders have been created. 567 F.Supp.3d at 656. Nor is there any way to know whether those goals would adequately be met in the absence of a race-based admissions program. As UNC itself acknowledges, these qualitative standards are difficult to measure. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, at 78, but see Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 381, 136 S.Ct. 2198 (requiring race-based admissions programs to operate in a manner that is sufficiently measurable).",Roberts,0,
2022-009,153,"Third, respondents suggest that race-based preferences must be allowed to continue for at least five more years, based on the Court's statement in Grutter that it expected that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary. 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The 25-year mark articulated in Grutter, however, reflected only that Court's view that race-based preferences would, by 2028, be unnecessary to ensure a requisite level of racial diversity on college campuses. Ibid. That expectation was oversold. Neither Harvard nor UNC believes that race-based admissions will in fact be unnecessary in five years, and both universities thus expect to continue using race as a criterion well beyond the time limit that Grutter suggested. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20-1199, at 84-85, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, at 85-86. Indeed, the high school applicants that Harvard and UNC will evaluate this fall using their race-based admissions systems are expected to graduate in 2028-25 years after Grutter was decided.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,154,"Finally, respondents argue that their programs need not have an end point at all because they frequently review them to determine whether they remain necessary. See Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, at 52, Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 58-59. Respondents point to language in Grutter that, they contend, permits the durational requirement to be met with periodic reviews to determine  whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity. 539 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325. But Grutter never suggested that periodic review could make unconstitutional conduct constitutional. To the contrary, the Court made clear that race-based admissions programs eventually had to end—despite whatever periodic review universities conducted. Ibid., see also supra, at 2163-2164.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,155,"Here, however, Harvard concedes that its race-based admissions program has no end point. Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, at 52 (Harvard has not set a sunset date for its program (internal quotation marks omitted)). And it acknowledges that the way it thinks about the use of race in its admissions process is the same now as it was nearly 50 years ago. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20-1199, at 91. UNC's race-based admissions program is likewise not set to expire any time soon—nor, indeed, any time at all. The University admits that it has not set forth a proposed time period in which it believes it can end all race-conscious admissions practices. 567 F.Supp.3d at 612. And UNC suggests that it might soon use race to a greater extent than it currently does. See Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, at 57. In short, there is no reason to believe that respondents will—even acting in good faith—comply with the Equal Protection Clause any time soon.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,157,"The dissenting opinions resist these conclusions. They would instead uphold respondents' admissions programs based on their view that the Fourteenth Amendment permits state actors to remedy the effects of societal discrimination through explicitly race-based measures. Although both opinions are thorough and thoughtful in many respects, this Court has long rejected their core thesis.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,158,"The dissents' interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause is not new. In Bakke, four Justices would have permitted race-based admissions programs to remedy the effects of societal discrimination. 438 U.S. at 362, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). But that minority view was just that—a minority view. Justice Powell, who provided the fifth vote and controlling opinion in Bakke, firmly rejected the notion that societal discrimination constituted a compelling interest. Such an interest presents an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past, he explained. Id., at 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733. It cannot justify a racial classification that imposes disadvantages upon persons  who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the race-based admissions program are thought to have suffered. Id., at 310, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,159,"The Court soon adopted Justice Powell's analysis as its own. In the years after Bakke, the Court repeatedly held that ameliorating societal discrimination does not constitute a compelling interest that justifies race-based state action. An effort to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest, we said plainly in Hunt, a 1996 case about the Voting Rights Act. 517 U.S. at 909-910, 116 S.Ct. 1894. We reached the same conclusion in Croson, a case that concerned a preferential government contracting program. Permitting past societal discrimination to serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for `remedial relief' for every disadvantaged group. 488 U.S. at 505, 109 S.Ct. 706. Opening that door would shutter another—the dream of a Nation of equal citizens  would be lost, we observed, in a mosaic of shifting  preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. Id., at 505-506, 109 S.Ct. 706. Such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality. Id., at 506, 109 S.Ct. 706.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,160,"The dissents here do not acknowledge any of this. They fail to cite Hunt. They fail to cite Croson. They fail to mention that the entirety of their analysis of the Equal Protection Clause—the statistics, the cases, the history—has been considered and rejected before. There is a reason the principal dissent must invoke Justice Marshall's partial dissent in Bakke nearly a dozen times while mentioning Justice Powell's controlling opinion barely once (Justice JACKSON's opinion ignores Justice Powell altogether). For what one dissent denigrates as rhetorical flourishes about colorblindness, post, at 2232 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), are in fact the proud pronouncements of cases like Loving and Yick Wo, like Shelley and Bolling —they are defining statements of law. We understand the dissents want that law to be different. They are entitled to that desire. But they surely cannot claim the mantle of stare decisis while pursuing it.8",Roberts,0,
2022-009,161,"The dissents are no more faithful to our precedent on race-based admissions. To hear the principal dissent tell it, Grutter blessed such programs indefinitely, until racial inequality will end. Post, at 2255 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But Grutter did no such thing. It emphasized—not once or twice, but at least six separate times— that race-based admissions programs must have reasonable durational limits and that their deviation from the norm of equal treatment must be a temporary matter. 539 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The Court also disclaimed enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences. Ibid. Yet the justification for race-based admissions that the dissent latches on to is just that—unceasing.",Roberts,0,
2022-009,162,"The principal dissent's reliance on Fisher II is similarly mistaken. There, by a 4-to-3 vote, the Court upheld a sui generis race-based admissions program used by the University of Texas, 579 U.S. at 377, 136 S.Ct. 2198, whose goal it was to enroll a critical mass of certain minority students, Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 297, 133 S.Ct. 2411.

The Court thus reaffirmed the continuing obligation of universities to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny. Id., at 379, 136 S.Ct. 2198. To drive the point home, Fisher II limited itself just as Grutter  had—in duration. The Court stressed that its decision did not necessarily mean the University may rely on the same policy going forward. 579 U.S. at 388, 136 S.Ct. 2198 (emphasis added), see also Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 313, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (recognizing that Grutter  approved the plan at issue upon concluding that it was limited in time).

While the dissent would certainly not permit university programs that discriminated against black and Latino applicants, it is perfectly willing to let the programs here continue.

But, despite the dissent's assertion to the contrary, universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today. (A dissenting opinion is generally not the best source of legal advice on how to comply with the majority opinion.) What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows, and the prohibition against racial discrimination is levelled at the thing, not the name. Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 325, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1867). A benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be tied to that student's courage and determination. Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student's unique ability to contribute to the university. In other words, the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual—not on the basis of race.",Roberts,0,

2022-009,185,"In its 1864 election platform, the Republican Party pledged to amend the Constitution to accomplish the utter and complete extirpation of slavery from the soil of the Republic. 2 A. Schlesinger, History of U. S. Political Parties 1860-1910, p. 1303  (1973). After their landslide victory, Republicans quickly moved to make good on that promise. Congress proposed what would become the Thirteenth Amendment to the States in January 1865, and it was ratified as part of the Constitution later that year. The new Amendment stated that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist in the United States except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. § 1. It thus not only prohibited States from themselves enslaving persons, but also obligated them to end enslavement by private individuals within their borders. Its Framers viewed the text broadly, arguing that it allowed Congress to legislate not merely against slavery itself, but against all the badges and relics of a slave system. A. Amar, America's Constitution: A Biography 362 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Amendment also authorized Congress  to enforce its terms by appropriate legislation—authority not granted in any prior Amendment. § 2. Proponents believed this enforcement clause permitted legislative measures designed to accomplish the Amendment's broader goal of equality for the freedmen.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,186,"It quickly became clear, however, that further amendment would be necessary to safeguard that goal. Soon after the Thirteenth Amendment's adoption, the reconstructed Southern States began to enact Black Codes, which circumscribed the newly won freedoms of blacks. The Black Code of Mississippi, for example, imposed all sorts of disabilities on blacks, including limiting their freedom of movement and barring them from following certain occupations, owning firearms, serving on juries, testifying in cases involving whites, or voting. E. Foner, The Second Founding 48 (2019).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,187,"Congress responded with the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, in an attempt to pre-empt the Black Codes. The 1866 Act promised such a sweeping form of equality that it would lead many to say that it exceeded the scope of Congress' authority under the Thirteenth Amendment. As enacted, it stated:",Thomas,0,
2022-009,188,"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States, and such citizens, of every race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall have the same right, in every State and Territory in the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,189,"The text of the provision left no doubt as to its aim: All persons born in the United States were equal citizens entitled to the same rights and subject to the same penalties as white citizens in the categories enumerated. See M. McConnell, Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions, 81 Va. L. Rev. 947, 958 (1995) (Note that the bill neither forbade racial discrimination generally nor did it guarantee particular rights to all persons. Rather, it required an equality in certain specific rights). And, while the 1866 Act used the rights of  white citizens as a benchmark, its rule was decidedly colorblind, safeguarding legal equality for all citizens of every race and color and providing the same rights to all.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,190,"The 1866 Act's evolution further highlights its rule of equality. To start, Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1857), had previously held that blacks were not regarded as a portion of the people or citizens of the Government and had no rights which the white man was bound to respect. Id., at 407, 411. The Act, however, would effectively overrule Dred Scott and ensure the equality that had been promised to blacks. But the Act went further still. On January 29, 1866, Senator Lyman Trumbull, the bill's principal sponsor in the Senate, proposed text stating that all persons of African descent born in the United States are hereby declared to be citizens. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 474. The following day, Trumbull revised his proposal, removing the reference to African descent and declaring more broadly that all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign Power, are citizens of the United States. Id., at 498.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,191,"In the years before the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, jurists and legislators often connected citizenship with equality, where the absence or presence of one entailed the absence or presence of the other. United States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1539, 1547, 212 L.Ed.2d 496 (2022) (THOMAS, J., concurring). The addition of a citizenship guarantee thus evidenced an intent to broaden the provision, extending beyond recently freed blacks and incorporating a more general view of equality for all Americans. Indeed, the drafters later included a specific carveout for Indians not taxed, demonstrating the breadth of the bill's otherwise general citizenship language. 14 Stat. 27.1 As Trumbull explained, the provision created a bond between all Americans, any statute which is not equal to all, and which deprives any citizen of civil rights which are secured to other citizens, was an unjust encroachment upon his liberty and a badge of servitude prohibited by the Constitution. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 474 (emphasis added).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,192,"Trumbull and most of the Act's other supporters identified the Thirteenth Amendment as a principal source of constitutional authority for the Act's nondiscrimination provisions. See, e.g., id., at 475 (statement of Sen. Trumbull), id., at 1152 (statement of Rep. Thayer), id., at 503-504 (statement of Sen. Howard). In particular, they explained that the Thirteenth Amendment allowed Congress not merely to legislate against slavery itself, but also to counter measures which deprive any citizen of civil rights which are secured to other citizens. Id., at 474.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,193,"But opponents argued that Congress' authority did not sweep so broadly. President Andrew Johnson, for example, contended that Congress lacked authority to pass the measure, seizing on the breadth of the citizenship text and emphasizing state authority over matters of state citizenship. See S. Doc. No. 31, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 6 (1866) (Johnson veto message). Consequently, doubts about the constitutional authority conferred by that measure led supporters to supplement their Thirteenth Amendment arguments with other sources of constitutional authority. R. Williams, Originalism and the Other  Desegregation Decision, 99 Va. L. Rev. 493, 532-533 (2013) (describing appeals to the naturalization power and the inherent power to protect the rights of citizens). As debates continued, it became increasingly apparent that safeguarding the 1866 Act, including its promise of black citizenship and the equal rights that citizenship entailed, would require further submission to the people of the United States in the form of a proposed constitutional amendment. See, e.g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 498 (statement of Sen. Van Winkle).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,195,"Critically, many of those who believed that Congress lacked the authority to enact the 1866 Act also supported the principle of racial equality. So, almost immediately following the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, several proposals for further amendments were submitted in Congress. One such proposal, approved by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction and then submitted to the House of Representatives on February 26, 1866, would have declared that the Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure to the citizens of each State all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States, and to all persons in the several States equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property. Id., at 1033-1034. Representative John Bingham, its drafter, was among those who believed Congress lacked the power to enact the 1866 Act. See id., at 1291. Specifically, he believed the very letter of the Constitution already required equality, but the enforcement of that requirement is of the reserved powers of the States. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1034, 1291 (statement of Rep. Bingham). His proposed constitutional amendment accordingly would provide a clear constitutional basis for the 1866 Act and ensure that future Congresses would be unable to repeal it. See W. Nelson, The Fourteenth Amendment 48-49 (1988).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,196,"Discussion of Bingham's initial draft was later postponed in the House, but the Joint Committee on Reconstruction continued its work. See 2 K. Lash, The Reconstruction Amendments 8 (2021). In April, Representative Thaddeus Stevens proposed to the Joint Committee an amendment that began, no discrimination shall be made by any State nor by the United States as to the civil rights of persons because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. S. Doc. No. 711, 63d Cong., 1st Sess., 31-32 (1915) (reprinting the Journal of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction for the Thirty-Ninth Congress). Stevens' proposal was later revised to read as follows: `No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' Id., at 39. This revised text was submitted to the full House on April 30, 1866. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2286-2287. Like the eventual first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, this proposal embodied the familiar Privileges or Immunities, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses. And, importantly, it also featured an enforcement clause—with text borrowed from the Thirteenth Amendment—conferring upon Congress the power to enforce its provisions. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,197,"Stevens explained that the draft was intended to allow Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States, so far that the law which operates upon one man shall operate equally upon all.

Moreover, Stevens' later statements indicate that he did not believe there was a  difference in substance between the new proposal and earlier measures calling for impartial and equal treatment without regard to race. U. S. Brown Reargument Brief 44 (noting a distinction only with respect to a suffrage provision). And, Bingham argued that the need for the proposed text was one of the lessons that have been taught  by the history of the past four years of terrific conflict during the Civil War. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2542. The proposal passed the House by a vote of 128 to 37. Id., at 2545.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,198,"Senator Jacob Howard introduced the proposed Amendment in the Senate, powerfully asking, Ought not the time to be now passed when one measure of justice is to be meted out to a member of one caste while another and a different measure is meted out to the member of another caste, both castes being alike citizens of the United States, both bound to obey the same laws, to sustain the burdens of the same Government, and both equally responsible to justice and to God for the deeds done in the body? Id., at 2766. In keeping with this view, he proposed an introductory sentence, declaring that `all persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the States wherein they reside.' Id., at 2869. This text, the Citizenship Clause, was the final missing element of what would ultimately become § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Howard's draft for the proposed citizenship text was modeled on the Civil Rights Act of 1866's text, and he suggested the alternative language to remove all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United States, a question which had long been a great desideratum in the jurisprudence and legislation of this country. Id., at 2890. He further characterized the addition as simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already. Ibid.",Thomas,0,

And, in June 1866, the amendment was submitted to the States for their consideration and ratification. Two years later, it was ratified by the requisite number of States and became the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See 15 Stat. 706-707, id., at 709-711.

2022-009,201,"As enacted, the text of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a firm statement of equality before the law.

2022-009,202,"The drafters and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment focused on this broad equality idea, offering surprisingly little explanation of which term was intended to accomplish which part of the Amendment's overall goal. The available materials show, however, that there were widespread expressions of a general understanding of the broad scope of the Amendment similar to that abundantly demonstrated in the Congressional debates, namely, that the first section of the Amendment would establish the full constitutional right of all persons to equality before the law and would prohibit legal distinctions based on race or color.

See, e.g., J. Harrison, Reconstructing the Privileges or Immunities Clause, 101 Yale L. J. 1385, 1388 (1992) (noting that the primary purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to mandate certain rules of racial equality, especially those contained in Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866).2 The Amendment's phrasing supports this view, and there does not appear to have been any argument to the contrary predating Brown.",Thomas,0,

And, like the 1866 Act, the Amendment also clarified that American citizenship conferred rights not just against the Federal Government but also the government of the citizen's State of residence. Unlike the Civil Rights Act, however, the Amendment employed a wholly race-neutral text, extending privileges or immunities to all citizens—even if its practical effect was to provide all citizens with the same privileges then enjoyed by whites. That citizenship guarantee was often linked with the concept of equality. Vaello Madero, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1548 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Combining the citizenship guarantee with the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment ensures protection for all equal citizens of the Nation without regard to race.

2022-009,208,"The Civil Rights Act of 1875 sought to counteract the systems of racial segregation that had arisen in the wake of the Reconstruction era. Advocates of so-called separate-but-equal systems, which allowed segregated facilities for blacks and whites, had argued that laws permitting or requiring such segregation treated members of both races precisely alike: Blacks could not attend a white school, but symmetrically, whites could not attend a black school.

Importantly, however, the Acts applied to freedmen (and refugees), a formally race-neutral category, not blacks writ large.

Thus, while this legislation appears to have provided a discrete race-based benefit, its aim—to prohibit race-based exploitation— may not have been possible at the time without using a racial screen. In other words, the statute's racial classifications may well have survived strict scrutiny. See Rappaport 111-112. Another law, passed in 1867, provided funds for freedmen or destitute colored people in the District of Columbia. Res. of Mar. 16, 1867, No. 4, 15 Stat. 20.

Rappaport 104-105 (citing Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1507). Congress thus may have enacted the measure not because of race, but rather to address a special problem in shantytowns in the District where blacks lived.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,221,"These laws—even if targeting race as such—likely were also constitutionally permissible examples of Government action undoing the effects of past discrimination in a way that does not involve classification by race, even though they had a racially disproportionate impact. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 526, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government can plainly remedy a race-based injury that it has inflicted—though such remedies must be meant to further a colorblind government, not perpetuate racial consciousness. See id., at 505, 109 S.Ct. 706 (majority opinion). In that way, race-based government measures during the 1860's and 1870's to remedy state-enforced slavery were  not inconsistent with the colorblind Constitution. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 772, n. 19, 127 S.Ct. 2738 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Moreover, the very same Congress passed both these laws andthe unambiguously worded Civil Rights Act of 1866 that clearly prohibited discrimination on the basis of race.3 And, as noted above, the proponents of these laws explicitly sought equal rights without regard to race while disavowing any antisubordination view.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,222,"Justice SOTOMAYOR argues otherwise, pointing to a number of race-conscious federal laws passed around the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment. Post, at 2228 (dissenting opinion). She identifies the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1865, already discussed above, as one such law, but she admits that the programs did not benefit blacks exclusively. She also does not dispute that legislation targeting the needs of newly freed blacks in 1865 could be understood as directly remedial. Even today, nothing prevents the States from according an admissions preference to identified victims of discrimination. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 526, 109 S.Ct. 706 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (While most of the beneficiaries might be black, neither the  beneficiaries nor those disadvantaged by the preference would be identified on the basis of their race (emphasis in original)), see also ante, at 2175-2176.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,223,"Justice SOTOMAYOR points also to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which as discussed above, mandated that all citizens have the same rights as those enjoyed by white citizens. 14 Stat. 27. But these references to the station of white citizens do not refute the view that the Fourteenth Amendment is colorblind. Rather, they specify that, in meeting the Amendment's goal of equal citizenship, States must level up. The Act did not single out a group of citizens for special treatment—rather, all citizens were meant to be treated the same as those who, at the time, had the full rights of citizenship. Other provisions of the 1866 Act reinforce this view, providing for equality in civil rights. See Rappaport 97. Most notably, § 14 stated that the basic civil rights of citizenship shall be secured without respect to race or color. 14 Stat. 176-177. And, § 8 required that funds from land sales must be used to support schools without distinction of color or race,  in the parishes of the area where the land had been sold. Id., at 175.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,224,"In addition to these federal laws, Harvard also points to two state laws: a South Carolina statute that placed the burden of proof on the defendant when a colored or black plaintiff claimed a violation, 1870 S. C. Acts pp. 387-388, and Kentucky legislation that authorized a county superintendent to aid negro paupers in Mercer County, 1871 Ky. Acts pp. 273-274. Even if these statutes provided race-based benefits, they do not support respondents' and Justice SOTOMAYOR's view that the Fourteenth Amendment was contemporaneously understood to permit differential treatment based on race, prohibiting only caste legislation while authorizing antisubordination measures. Cf., e.g., O. Fiss, Groups and the Equal Protection Clause, 5 Philos. & Pub. Aff. 107, 147 (1976) (articulating the antisubordination view), R. Siegel, Equality Talk: Antisubordination and Anticlassification Values in Constitutional Struggles Over Brown, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 1470, 1473, n. 8 (2004) (collecting scholarship). At most, these laws would support the kinds of discrete remedial measures that our precedents have permitted.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,225,"If services had been given only to white persons up to the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, then providing those same services only to previously excluded black persons would work to equalize treatment against a concrete baseline of government-imposed inequality. It thus may have been the case that Kentucky's county-specific, race-based public aid law was necessary because that particular county was not providing certain services to local poor blacks. Similarly, South Carolina's burden-shifting framework (where the substantive rule being applied remained notably race neutral) may have been necessary to streamline litigation around the most commonly litigated type of case: a lawsuit seeking to remedy discrimination against a member of the large population of recently freed black Americans. See 1870 S. C. Acts, at 386 (documenting persistent racial discrimination by state-licensed entities).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,226,"Most importantly, however, there was a wide range of federal and state statutes enacted at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption and during the period thereafter that explicitly sought to discriminate against blacks on the basis of race or a proxy for race. See Rappaport 113-115. These laws, hallmarks of the race-conscious Jim Crow era, are precisely the sort of enactments that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to eradicate. Yet, proponents of an antisubordination view necessarily do not take those  laws as evidence of the Fourteenth Amendment's true meaning. And rightly so. Neither those laws, nor a small number of laws that appear to target blacks for preferred treatment, displace the equality vision reflected in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment. This is particularly true in light of the clear equality requirements present in the Fourteenth Amendment's text. See New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct. 2111, 2128-2129, 213 L.Ed.2d 387 (2022) (noting that text controls over inconsistent postratification history).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,228,"Properly understood, our precedents have largely adhered to the Fourteenth Amendment's demand for colorblind laws.4 That is why, for example, courts must subject all racial classifications to the strictest of scrutiny. Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 121, 115 S.Ct. 2038 (THOMAS, J., concurring), see also ante, at 2166, n. 4 (emphasizing the consequences of an insufficiently searching inquiry). And, in case after case, we have employed strict scrutiny vigorously to reject various forms of racial discrimination as unconstitutional. See Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 317-318, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The Court today rightly upholds that tradition and acknowledges the consequences that have flowed from Grutter's contrary approach.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,229,"Three aspects of today's decision warrant comment: First, to satisfy strict scrutiny, universities must be able to establish an actual link between racial discrimination and educational benefits. Second, those engaged in racial discrimination do not deserve deference with respect to their reasons for discriminating. Third, attempts to remedy past governmental discrimination must be closely tailored to address that particular past governmental discrimination.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,231,"To satisfy strict scrutiny, universities must be able to establish a compelling reason to racially discriminate. Grutter recognized only one interest sufficiently compelling to justify race-conscious admissions programs: the educational benefits of a diverse student body. 539 U.S. at 328, 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Expanding on this theme, Harvard and UNC have offered a grab bag of interests to justify their programs, spanning from `training future leaders in the public and private sectors' to `enhancing appreciation, respect, and empathy,' with references to `better educating their students through diversity' in between. Ante, at 2166. The Court today finds that each of these interests are too vague and immeasurable to suffice, ibid., and I agree.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,232,"Even in Grutter, the Court failed to clearly define the educational benefits of a  diverse student body. 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Thus, in the years since Grutter, I have sought to understand exactly how racial diversity yields educational benefits. With nearly 50 years to develop their arguments, neither Harvard nor UNC—two of the foremost research institutions in the world—nor any of their amici can explain that critical link.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,233,"Harvard, for example, offers a report finding that meaningful representation of racial minorities promotes several goals. Only one of those goals—producing new knowledge stemming from diverse outlooks, 980 F.3d 157, 174 (CA1 2020)— bears any possible relationship to educational benefits. Yet, it too is extremely vague and offers no indication that, for example, student test scores increased as a result of Harvard's efforts toward racial diversity.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,234,"More fundamentally, it is not clear how racial diversity, as opposed to other forms of diversity, uniquely and independently advances Harvard's goal. This is particularly true because Harvard blinds itself to other forms of applicant diversity, such as religion. See 2 App. in No. 20-1199, pp. 734-743. It may be the case that exposure to different perspectives and thoughts can foster debate, sharpen young minds, and hone students' reasoning skills. But, it is not clear how diversity with respect to race, qua race, furthers this goal. Two white students, one from rural Appalachia and one from a wealthy San Francisco suburb, may well have more diverse outlooks on this metric than two students from Manhattan's Upper East Side attending its most elite schools, one of whom is white and other of whom is black. If Harvard cannot even explain the link between racial diversity and education, then surely its interest in racial diversity cannot be compelling enough to overcome the constitutional limits on race consciousness.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,235,"UNC fares no better. It asserts, for example, an interest in training students to live together in a diverse society. Brief for University Respondents in No. 21707, p. 39. This may well be important to a university experience, but it is a social goal, not an educational one. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 347-348, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing similar rationales as divorced from educational goals). And, again, UNC offers no reason why seeking a diverse society would not be equally supported by admitting individuals with diverse perspectives and backgrounds, rather than varying skin pigmentation.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,236,"Nor have amici pointed to any concrete and quantifiable educational benefits of racial diversity. The United States focuses on alleged civic benefits, including increasing tolerance and decreasing racial prejudice. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-22. Yet, when it comes to educational benefits, the Government offers only one study purportedly showing that college diversity experiences are significantly and positively related to cognitive development and that interpersonal interactions with racial diversity are the most strongly related to cognitive development. N. Bowman, College Diversity Experiences and Cognitive Development: A Meta-Analysis, 80 Rev. Educ. Research 4, 20 (2010). Here again, the link is, at best, tenuous, unspecific, and stereotypical. Other amici assert that diversity (generally) fosters the even-more nebulous values of creativity and innovation, particularly in graduates' future workplaces. See, e.g., Brief for Major American Business Enterprises as Amici Curiae 7-9, Brief for Massachusetts Institute of Technology et al. as Amici Curiae 16-17 (describing experience at IBM). Yet, none of those assertions deals exclusively with racial diversity—as  opposed to cultural or ideological diversity. And, none of those amici demonstrate measurable or concrete benefits that have resulted from universities' race-conscious admissions programs.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,237,"Of course, even if these universities had shown that racial diversity yielded any concrete or measurable benefits, they would still face a very high bar to show that their interest is compelling. To survive strict scrutiny, any such benefits would have to outweigh the tremendous harm inflicted by sorting individuals on the basis of race. See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 3 L.Ed.2d 19 (1958) (following Brown, law and order are not here to be preserved by depriving the Negro children of their constitutional rights). As the Court's opinions in these cases make clear, all racial stereotypes harm and demean individuals. That is why only those measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent violence, will constitute a pressing public necessity sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny today. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 353, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (internal quotations marks omitted). Cf. Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333, 334, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L.Ed.2d 1212 (1968) (Black, J., concurring) (protecting prisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored discrimination), Croson, 488 U.S. at 521, 109 S.Ct. 706 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (At least where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb  can justify racial discrimination). For this reason, just as the alleged educational benefits of segregation were insufficient to justify racial discrimination in the 1950s, see Brown v. Board of Education, the alleged educational benefits of diversity cannot justify racial discrimination today. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 320, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citation omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,239,"The Court also correctly refuses to defer to the universities' own assessments that the alleged benefits of race-conscious admissions programs are compelling. It instead demands that the interests universities view as compelling must be capable of being subjected to meaningful judicial review. Ante, at 2166. In other words, a court must be able to measure the goals asserted and determine when they have been reached. Ante, at 2166-2167. The Court's opinion today further insists that universities must be able to articulate a meaningful connection between the means they employ and the goals they pursue. Ante, at 2167. Again, I agree. Universities' self-proclaimed righteousness does not afford them license to discriminate on the basis of race.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,240,"In fact, it is error for a court to defer to the views of an alleged discriminator while assessing claims of racial discrimination. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 362-364, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), see also Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 318-319, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (THOMAS, J., concurring), United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 551, n. 19, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996) (refusing to defer to the Virginia Military Institute's judgment that the changes necessary to accommodate the admission of women would be too great and characterizing the necessary changes as manageable). We would not offer such deference in any other context. In employment discrimination lawsuits under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, for example, courts require only a minimal prima facie showing by a complainant before shifting the burden onto the shoulders of the alleged-discriminator employer. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 803-805, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). And, Congress has passed numerous  laws—such as the Civil Rights Act of 1875—under its authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, each designed to counter discrimination and each relying on courts to bring a skeptical eye to alleged discriminators.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,241,"This judicial skepticism is vital. History has repeatedly shown that purportedly benign discrimination may be pernicious, and discriminators may go to great lengths to hide and perpetuate their unlawful conduct. Take, for example, the university respondents here. Harvard's holistic admissions policy began in the 1920s when it was developed to exclude Jews. See M. Synnott, The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admission at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, 1900-1970, pp. 58-59, 61, 69, 73-74 (2010). Based on de facto quotas that Harvard quietly implemented, the proportion of Jews in Harvard's freshman class declined from 28% as late as 1925 to just 12% by 1933. J. Karabel, The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton 172 (2005). During this same period, Harvard played a prominent role in the eugenics movement. According to then-President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, excluding Jews from Harvard would help maintain admissions opportunities for Gentiles and perpetuate the purity of the Brahmin race—New England's white, Protestant upper crust. See D. Okrent, The Guarded Gate 309, and n. * (2019).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,242,"UNC also has a checkered history, dating back to its time as a segregated university. It admitted its first black undergraduate students in 1955—but only after being ordered to do so by a court, following a long legal battle in which UNC sought to keep its segregated status. Even then, UNC did not turn on a dime: The first three black students admitted as undergraduates enrolled at UNC but ultimately earned their bachelor's degrees elsewhere. See M. Beauregard, Column: The Desegregation of UNC, The Daily Tar Heel, Feb. 16, 2022. To the extent past is prologue, the university respondents' histories hardly recommend them as trustworthy arbiters of whether racial discrimination is necessary to achieve educational goals.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,243,"Of course, none of this should matter in any event, courts have an independent duty to interpret and uphold the Constitution that no university's claimed interest may override. See ante, at 2168, n. 5. The Court today makes clear that, in the future, universities wishing to discriminate based on race in admissions must articulate and justify a compelling and measurable state interest based on concrete evidence. Given the strictures set out by the Court, I highly doubt any will be able to do so.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,245,"In an effort to salvage their patently unconstitutional programs, the universities and their amici pivot to argue that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the use of race to benefit only certain racial groups— rather than applicants writ large. Yet, this is just the latest disguise for discrimination. The sudden narrative shift is not surprising, as it has long been apparent that `diversity was merely the current rationale of convenience' to support racially discriminatory admissions programs. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 393, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Under our precedents, this new rationale is also lacking.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,246,"To start, the case for affirmative action has emphasized a number of rationales over the years, including: (1) restitution to compensate those who have been victimized by past discrimination, (2) fostering diversity, (3) facilitating integration and the destruction of perceived racial castes, and (4) countering longstanding  and diffuse racial prejudice. See R. Kennedy, For Discrimination: Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law 78 (2013), see also P. Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 1, 22-46 (2002). Again, this Court has only recognized one interest as compelling: the educational benefits of diversity embraced in Grutter. Yet, as the universities define the diversity that they practice, it encompasses social and aesthetic goals far afield from the education-based interest discussed in Grutter. See supra, at 2188. The dissents too attempt to stretch the diversity rationale, suggesting that it supports broad remedial interests. See, e.g., post, at 2237-2238, 2248-2249, 2262 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (noting that UNC's black admissions percentages do not reflect the diversity of the State, equating the diversity interest under the Court's precedents with a goal of integration in higher education more broadly, and warning of the dangerous consequences of an America where its leadership does not reflect the diversity of the People), post, at 2275-2276 (opinion of JACKSON, J.) (explaining that diversity programs close wealth gaps). But language —particularly the language of controlling opinions of this Court—is not so elastic. See J. Pieper, Abuse of Language —Abuse of Power 23 (L. Krauth transl. 1992) (explaining that propaganda, in contradiction to the nature of language, intends not to communicate but to manipulate and becomes an instrument of power (emphasis deleted)).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,247,"The Court refuses to engage in this lexicographic drift, seeing these arguments for what they are: a remedial rationale in disguise. See ante, at 2172-2174. As the Court points out, the interest for which respondents advocate has been presented to and rejected by this Court many times before. In Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), the University of California made clear its rationale for the quota system it had established: It wished to counteract effects of generations of pervasive discrimination against certain minority groups. Brief for Petitioner, O. T. 1977, No. 76811, p. 2. But, the Court rejected this distinctly remedial rationale, with Justice Powell adopting in its place the familiar diversity interest that appeared later in Grutter. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 306, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (plurality opinion). The Court similarly did not adopt the broad remedial rationale in Grutter, and it rejects it again today. Newly and often minted theories cannot be said to be commanded by our precedents.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,248,"Indeed, our precedents have repeatedly and soundly distinguished between programs designed to compensate victims of past governmental discrimination from so-called benign race-conscious measures, such as affirmative action. Croson, 488 U.S. at 504-505, 109 S.Ct. 706, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 226-227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995). To enforce that distinction, our precedents explicitly require that any attempt to compensate victims of past governmental discrimination must be concrete and traceable to the de jure segregated system, which must have some discrete and continuing discriminatory effect that warrants a present remedy. See United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 731, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992). Today's opinion for the Court reaffirms the need for such a close remedial fit, hewing to the same line we have consistently drawn. Ante, at 2167-2168.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,249,"Without such guardrails, the Fourteenth Amendment would become self-defeating, promising a Nation based on the equality ideal but yielding a quota- and caste-ridden society steeped in race-based discrimination. Even Grutter itself could not tolerate this outcome. It accordingly imposed a  time limit for its race-based regime, observing that `a core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race.' 539 U.S. at 341-342, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984), alterations omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,250,"The Court today enforces those limits. And rightly so. As noted above, both Harvard and UNC have a history of racial discrimination. But, neither have even attempted to explain how their current racially discriminatory programs are even remotely traceable to their past discriminatory conduct. Nor could they, the current race-conscious admissions programs take no account of ancestry and, at least for Harvard, likely have the effect of discriminating against some of the very same ethnic groups against which Harvard previously discriminated (i.e., Jews and those who are not part of the white elite). All the while, Harvard and UNC ask us to blind ourselves to the burdens imposed on the millions of innocent applicants denied admission because of their membership in a currently disfavored race.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,251,"The Constitution neither commands nor permits such a result. Purchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, the Fourteenth Amendment recognizes that classifications based on race lead to ruinous consequences for individuals and the Nation. Adarand Constructors, Inc., 515 U.S. at 240, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Consequently, all racial classifications are inherently suspect, id., at 223-224, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (majority opinion) (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted), and must be subjected to the searching inquiry conducted by the Court, ante, at 2165-2173.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,253,"Both experience and logic have vindicated the Constitution's colorblind rule and confirmed that the universities' new narrative cannot stand. Despite the Court's hope in Grutter that universities would voluntarily end their race-conscious programs and further the goal of racial equality, the opposite appears increasingly true. Harvard and UNC now forthrightly state that they racially discriminate when it comes to admitting students, arguing that such discrimination is consistent with this Court's precedents. And they, along with today's dissenters, defend that discrimination as good. More broadly, it is becoming increasingly clear that discrimination on the basis of race—often packaged as affirmative action or equity programs—are based on the benighted notion that it is possible to tell when discrimination helps, rather than hurts, racial minorities. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 328, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (THOMAS, J., concurring).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,254,"We cannot be guided by those who would desire less in our Constitution, or by those who would desire more. The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.

2022-009,256,"The Constitution's colorblind rule reflects one of the core principles upon which our Nation was founded: that all men are created equal. Those words featured prominently in our Declaration of Independence and were inspired by a rich tradition of political thinkers, from Locke to Montesquieu, who considered equality to be the  foundation of a just government. See, e.g., J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government 48 (J. Gough ed. 1948), T. Hobbes, Leviathan 98 (M. Oakeshott ed. 1962), 1 B. Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws 121 (T. Nugent transl., J. Prichard ed. 1914). Several Constitutions enacted by the newly independent States at the founding reflected this principle. For example, the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776 explicitly affirmed that all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights. Ch. 1, § 1. The State Constitutions of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire adopted similar language. Pa. Const., Art. I (1776), in 2 Federal and State Constitutions 1541 (P. Poore ed. 1877), Mass. Const., Art. I (1780), in 1 id., at 957, N. H. Const., Art. I (1784), in 2 id., at 1280.5 And, prominent Founders publicly mused about the need for equality as the foundation for government. E.g., 1 Cong. Register 430 (T. Lloyd ed. 1789) (Madison, J.), 1 Letters and Other Writings of James Madison 164 (J. Lippincott ed. 1867), N. Webster, The Revolution in France, in 2 Political Sermons of the Founding Era, 1730-1805, pp. 1236-1299 (1998). As Jefferson declared in his first inaugural address, the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect. First Inaugural Address (Mar. 4, 1801), in 8 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 4 (Washington ed. 1854).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,257,"Our Nation did not initially live up to the equality principle. The institution of slavery persisted for nearly a century, and the United States Constitution itself included several provisions acknowledging the practice. The period leading up to our second founding brought these flaws into bold relief and encouraged the Nation to finally make good on the equality promise. As Lincoln recognized, the promise of equality extended to all people—including immigrants and blacks whose ancestors had taken no part in the original founding. See Speech at Chicago, Ill. (July 10, 1858), in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 488-489, 499 (R. Basler ed. 1953). Thus, in Lincoln's view, `the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence' extended to blacks as his `equal,' and `the equal of every living man.' The Lincoln-Douglas Debates 285 (H. Holzer ed. 1993).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,258,"As discussed above, the Fourteenth Amendment reflected that vision, affirming that equality and racial discrimination cannot coexist. Under that Amendment, the color of a person's skin is irrelevant to that individual's equal status as a citizen of this Nation. To treat him differently on the basis of such a legally irrelevant trait is therefore a deviation from the equality principle and a constitutional injury.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,259,"Of course, even the promise of the second founding took time to materialize. Seeking to perpetuate a segregationist system in the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, proponents urged a separate but equal regime. They met with initial success, ossifying the segregationist view for over a half century. As this Court said in Plessy:  A statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races—a distinction which is founded in the color of the two races, and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color—has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude. 163 U.S. at 543, 16 S.Ct. 1138.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,260,"Such a statement, of course, is precisely antithetical to the notion that all men, regardless of the color of their skin, are born equal and must be treated equally under the law. Only one Member of the Court adhered to the equality principle, Justice Harlan, standing alone in dissent, wrote: Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. Id., at 559, 16 S.Ct. 1138. Though Justice Harlan rightly predicted that Plessy would, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made  in the Dred Scott case, the Plessy rule persisted for over a half century. Ibid. While it remained in force, Jim Crow laws prohibiting blacks from entering or utilizing public facilities such as schools, libraries, restaurants, and theaters sprang up across the South.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,261,"This Court rightly reversed course in Brown v. Board of Education. The Brown appellants—those challenging segregated schools—embraced the equality principle, arguing that a racial criterion is a constitutional irrelevance, and is not saved from condemnation even though dictated by a sincere desire to avoid the possibility of violence or race friction. Brief for Appellants in Brown v. Board of Education, O. T. 1952, No. 1, p. 7 (citation omitted).6 Embracing that view, the Court held that in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place and separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Brown, 347 U.S. at 493, 495, 74 S.Ct. 686. Importantly, in reaching this conclusion, Brown did not rely on the particular qualities of the Kansas schools. The mere separation of students on the basis of race—the segregation complained of, id., at 495, 74 S.Ct. 686 (emphasis added)—constituted a constitutional injury. See ante, at 2160 (Separate cannot be equal).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,262,"Just a few years later, the Court's application of Brown made explicit what was already forcefully implied: Our decisions have foreclosed any possible contention that  a statute or regulation fostering segregation in public facilities may stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. Turner v. Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 353, 82 S.Ct. 805, 7 L.Ed.2d 762 (1962) (per curiam), cf. A. Blaustein & C. Ferguson, Desegregation and the Law: The Meaning and Effect of the School Segregation Cases 145 (rev. 2d ed. 1962) (arguing that the Court in Brown had adopted a constitutional standard declaring that all classification by race is unconstitutional per se).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,263,"Today, our precedents place this principle beyond question. In assessing racial segregation during a race-motivated prison riot, for example, this Court applied strict scrutiny without requiring an allegation of  unequal treatment among the segregated facilities. Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505-506, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 160 L.Ed.2d 949 (2005). The Court today reaffirms the rule, stating that, following Brown, the time for making distinctions based on race had passed. Ante, at 2160. What was wrong when the Court decided Brown in 1954 cannot be right today. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 778, 127 S.Ct. 2738 (THOMAS, J., concurring).

I would have thought that history had by now taught a greater humility when attempting to distinguish good from harmful uses of racial criteria. Id., at 742, 127 S.Ct. 2738 (plurality opinion). From the Black Codes, to discriminatory and destructive social welfare programs, to discrimination by individual government actors, bigotry has reared its ugly head time and again. Anyone who today thinks that some form of racial discrimination will prove helpful should thus tread cautiously, lest racial discriminators succeed (as they once did) in using such language to disguise more invidious motives.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,266,"Arguments for the benefits of race-based solutions have proved pernicious in segregationist circles. Segregated universities once argued that race-based discrimination was needed to preserve harmony and peace and at the same time furnish equal education to both groups.

T. 1949, No. 44, p. 94, see also id., at 79 (`The mores of racial relationships are such as to rule out, for the present at least, any possibility of admitting white persons and Negroes to the same institutions'). And, parties consistently attempted to convince the Court that the time was not right to disrupt segregationist systems. See Brief for Appellees in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Ed., O. T. 1949, No. 34, p. 12 (claiming that a holding rejecting separate but equal would necessarily result  in the abandoning of many of the state's existing educational establishments and the crowding of other such establishments), Brief for State of Kansas on Reargument in Brown v. Board of Education, O. T. 1953, No. 1, p. 56 (We grant that segregation may not be the ethical or political ideal. At the same time we recognize that practical considerations may prevent realization of the ideal), Tr. of Oral Arg. in Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., O. T. 1954, No. 3, p. 208 (We are up against the proposition: What does the Negro profit if he procures an immediate detailed decree from this Court now and then impairs or mars or destroys the public school system in Prince Edward County). Litigants have even gone so far as to offer straight-faced arguments that segregation has practical benefits. Brief for Respondents in Sweatt v. Painter, at 77-78 (requesting deference to a state law, observing that `the necessity for such separation of the races still exists in the interest of public welfare, safety, harmony, health, and recreation ' and remarking on the reasonableness of the position), Brief for Appellees in Davis v.

The result, in the view of an overwhelming Virginia majority, has been to improve the relationship between the different races), id., at 25 (If segregation be stricken down, the  general welfare will be definitely harmed there would be more friction developed (internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, slaveholders once argued that slavery was a `positive good' that civilized blacks and elevated them in every dimension of life, and segregationists similarly asserted that segregation was not only benign, but good for black students. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 328-329, 133 S.Ct.. 2411 (THOMAS, J., concurring).",Thomas,0,

Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 780-781, 127 S.Ct. 2738 (THOMAS, J., concurring). We cannot now blink reality to pretend, as the dissents urge, that affirmative action should be legally permissible merely because the experts assure us that it is good for black students. Though I do not doubt the sincerity of my dissenting colleagues' beliefs, experts and elites have been wrong before —and they may prove to be wrong again. In part for this reason, the Fourteenth Amendment outlaws government-sanctioned racial discrimination of all types. The stakes are simply too high to gamble.7 Then, as now, the views that motivated Dred Scott and Plessy have not been confined to the past, and we must remain ever vigilant against all forms of racial discrimination.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,269,"Even taking the desire to help on its face, what initially seems like aid may in reality be a burden, including for the very people it seeks to assist. Take, for example, the college admissions policies here. Affirmative action policies do nothing to increase the overall number of blacks and Hispanics able to access a college education. Rather, those racial policies simply redistribute individuals among institutions of higher learning, placing some into more competitive institutions than they otherwise would have attended. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the World 145-146 (2004). In doing so, those policies sort at least some blacks and Hispanics into environments where they are less likely to succeed academically relative to their peers. Ibid. The resulting mismatch places many blacks and Hispanics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools in a position where underperformance is all but inevitable because they are less academically prepared than the white and Asian students with whom they must compete. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 332, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (THOMAS, J., concurring).",Thomas,0,
2022-009,270,"It is self-evident why that is so. As anyone who has labored over an algebra textbook has undoubtedly discovered, academic advancement results from hard work and practice, not mere declaration. Simply treating students as though their grades put them at the top of their high school classes does nothing to enhance the performance level of those students or otherwise prepare them for competitive college environments. In fact, studies suggest that large racial preferences for black and Hispanic applicants have led to a disproportionately  large share of those students receiving mediocre or poor grades once they arrive in competitive collegiate environments. See, e.g., R. Sander, A Systemic Analysis of Affirmative Action in American Law Schools, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 367, 371-372 (2004), see also R. Sander & R. Steinbuch, Mismatch and Bar Passage: A School-Specific Analysis (Oct. 6, 2017), https://ssrn.com/abstract=3054208. Take science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, for example. Those students who receive a large admissions preference are more likely to drop out of STEM fields than similarly situated students who did not receive such a preference. F. Smith & J. McArdle, Ethnic and Gender Differences in Science Graduation at Selective Colleges With Implications for Admission Policy and College Choice, 45 Research in Higher Ed. 353 (2004). Even if most minority students are able to meet the normal standards at the `average' range of colleges and universities, the systematic mismatching of minority students begun at the top can mean that such students are generally overmatched throughout all levels of higher education. T. Sowell, Race and Culture 176-177 (1994).8",Thomas,0,
2022-009,271,"These policies may harm even those who succeed academically. I have long believed that large racial preferences in college admissions stamp blacks and Hispanics with a badge of inferiority. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 241, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). They thus taint the accomplishments of all those who are admitted as a result of racial discrimination as well as all those who are the same race as those admitted as a result of racial discrimination because no one can distinguish those students from the ones whose race played a role in their admission. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 333, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Consequently, when blacks and, now, Hispanics take positions in the highest places of government, industry, or academia, it is an open question  whether their skin color played a part in their advancement. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 373, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The question itself is the stigma—because either racial discrimination did play a role, in which case the person may be deemed `otherwise unqualified,' or it did not, in which case asking the question itself unfairly marks those  who would succeed without discrimination. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,272,"Yet, in the face of those problems, it seems increasingly clear that universities are focused on aesthetic solutions unlikely to help deserving members of minority groups. In fact, universities' affirmative action programs are a particularly poor use of such resources. To start, these programs are overinclusive, providing the same admissions bump to a wealthy black applicant given every advantage in life as to a black applicant from a poor family with seemingly insurmountable barriers to overcome. In doing so, the programs may wind up helping the most well-off members of minority races without meaningfully assisting those who struggle with real hardship. Simultaneously, the programs risk  continuing to ignore the academic underperformance of the purported `beneficiaries' of racial preferences and the racial stigma that those preferences generate. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 371, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Rather than performing their academic mission, universities thus may seek only a facade—it is sufficient that the class looks right, even if it does not perform right.

2022-009,274,"Finally, it is not even theoretically possible to help a certain racial group without causing harm to members of other racial groups. It should be obvious that every racial classification helps, in a narrow sense, some races and hurts others. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 241, n. *, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). And, even purportedly benign race-based discrimination has secondary effects on members of other races. The antisubordination view thus has never guided the Court's analysis because whether a law relying upon racial taxonomy is `benign' or `malign' either turns on `whose ox is gored' or on distinctions found only in the eye of the beholder. Ibid. (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted). Courts are not suited to the impossible task of determining which racially discriminatory programs are helping which members of which races—and whether those benefits outweigh the burdens thrust onto other racial groups.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,275,"As the Court's opinion today explains, the zero-sum nature of college admissions —where students compete for a finite number of seats in each school's entering class—aptly demonstrates the point. Ante, at 2168-2169.9 Petitioner here represents Asian Americans who allege that, at the margins, Asian applicants were denied admission because of their race. Yet, Asian Americans can hardly be described as the beneficiaries of historical racial advantages. To the contrary, our Nation's first immigration ban targeted the Chinese, in part, based on worker resentment of the low wage rates accepted by Chinese workers. U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, Civil Rights Issues Facing Asian Americans in the 1990s, p. 3 (1992) (Civil Rights Issues), Act of May 6, 1882, ch. 126, 22 Stat. 58-59.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,276,"In subsequent years, strong anti-Asian sentiments in the Western States led to the adoption of many discriminatory laws at the State and local levels, similar to those aimed at blacks in the South, and segregation in public facilities, including schools, was quite common until after the Second World War. Civil Rights Issues 7, see also S. Hinnershitz, A Different Shade of Justice: Asian American Civil Rights in the South 21 (2017) (explaining that while both Asians and blacks have at times fought against similar forms of discrimination, the issues of citizenship and  immigrant status often defined Asian American battles for civil rights and separated them from African American legal battles). Indeed, this Court even sanctioned this segregation—in the context of schools, no less. In Gong Lum v. Rice, 275 U.S. 78, 81-82, 85-87, 48 S.Ct. 91, 72 L.Ed. 172 (1927), the Court held that a 9-year-old Chinese-American girl could be denied entry to a white school because she was a member of the Mongolian or yellow race.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,277,"Also, following the Japanese attack on the U. S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans in the American West were evacuated and interned in relocation camps. See Exec. Order No. 9066, 3 C.F.R. 1092 (1943). Over 120,000 were removed to camps beginning in 1942, and the last camp that held Japanese Americans did not close until 1948.

2022-009,278,"Given the history of discrimination against Asian Americans, especially their history with segregated schools, it seems particularly incongruous to suggest that a past history of segregationist policies toward blacks should be remedied at the expense of Asian American college applicants.10 But this problem is not limited to Asian Americans, more broadly, universities' discriminatory policies burden millions of applicants who are not responsible for the racial discrimination that sullied our Nation's past. That is why, in the absence of special circumstances, the remedy for de jure segregation ordinarily should not include educational programs for students who were not in school (or even alive) during the period of segregation. Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 137, 115 S.Ct. 2038 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Today's 17-year-olds, after all, did not live through the Jim Crow era, enact or enforce segregation laws, or take any action to oppress or enslave the victims of the past. Whatever their skin color, today's youth simply are not responsible for instituting the segregation of the 20th century, and they do not shoulder the moral debts of their ancestors. Our Nation should not punish today's youth for the sins of the past.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,280,"Far from advancing the cause of improved race relations in our Nation, affirmative action highlights our racial differences with pernicious effect. In fact, recent history reveals a disturbing pattern: Affirmative action policies appear to have prolonged the asserted need for racial discrimination. Parties and amici in these cases report that, in the nearly 50 years since Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750, racial progress on campuses adopting affirmative action admissions policies has stagnated, including making no meaningful progress toward a colorblind goal since Grutter. See ante, at 2165-2166. Rather, the legacy of Grutter appears to be ever increasing and strident demands for yet more racially oriented solutions.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,282,"It has become clear that sorting by race does not stop at the admissions office. In  his Grutter opinion, Justice Scalia criticized universities for talking of multiculturalism and racial diversity, but supporting tribalism and racial segregation on their campuses, including through minority only student organizations, separate minority housing opportunities, separate minority student centers, even separate minority-only graduation ceremonies. 539 U.S. at 349, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). This trend has hardly abated with time, and today, such programs are commonplace. See Brief for Gail Heriot et al. as Amici Curiae 9. In fact, a recent study considering 173 schools found that 43% of colleges offered segregated housing to students of different races, 46% offered segregated orientation programs, and 72% sponsored segregated graduation ceremonies. D. Pierre & P. Wood, Neo-Segregation at Yale 16-17 (2019), see also D. Pierre, Demands for Segregated Housing at Williams College Are Not News, Nat. Rev., May 8, 2019. In addition to contradicting the universities' claims regarding the need for interracial interaction, see Brief for National Association of Scholars as Amicus Curiae 4-12, these trends increasingly encourage our Nation's youth to view racial differences as important and segregation as routine.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,283,"Meanwhile, these discriminatory policies risk creating new prejudices and allowing old ones to fester. I previously observed that there can be no doubt that discriminatory affirmative action policies injure white and Asian applicants who are denied admission because of their race. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 331, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (concurring opinion). Petitioner here clearly demonstrates this fact. Moreover, no social science has disproved the notion that this discrimination `engenders attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provokes resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government's use of race.' Grutter, 539 U.S. at 373, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (quoting Adarand, 515 U.S. at 241, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (alterations omitted)). Applicants denied admission to certain colleges may come to believe —accurately or not—that their race was responsible for their failure to attain a life-long dream. These individuals, and others who wished for their success, may resent members of what they perceive to be favored races, believing that the successes of those individuals are unearned.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,284,"What, then, would be the endpoint of these affirmative action policies? Not racial harmony, integration, or equality under the law. Rather, these policies appear to be leading to a world in which everyone is defined by their skin color, demanding ever-increasing entitlements and preferences on that basis. Not only is that exactly the kind of factionalism that the Constitution was meant to safeguard against, see The Federalist No. 10 (J. Madison), but it is a factionalism based on ever-shifting sands.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,285,"That is because race is a social construct, we may each identify as members of particular races for any number of reasons, having to do with our skin color, our heritage, or our cultural identity. And, over time, these ephemeral, socially constructed categories have often shifted. For example, whereas universities today would group all white applicants together, white elites previously sought to exclude Jews and other white immigrant groups from higher education. In fact, it is impossible to look at an individual and know definitively his or her race, some who would consider themselves black, for example, may be quite fair skinned. Yet, university admissions policies ask individuals to identify themselves as belonging to one of only a few reductionist racial groups. With boxes for only black, white, Hispanic,  Asian, or the ambiguous other, how is a Middle Eastern person to choose? Someone from the Philippines? See post, at 2209-2211 (GORSUCH, J., concurring). Whichever choice he makes (in the event he chooses to report a race at all), the form silos him into an artificial category. Worse, it sends a clear signal that the category matters.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,286,"But, under our Constitution, race is irrelevant, as the Court acknowledges. In fact, all racial categories are little more than stereotypes, suggesting that immutable characteristics somehow conclusively determine a person's ideology, beliefs, and abilities. Of course, that is false. See ante, at 2169-2171 (noting that the Court's Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence forbids such stereotyping). Members of the same race do not all share the exact same experiences and viewpoints, far from it. A black person from rural Alabama surely has different experiences than a black person from Manhattan or a black first-generation immigrant from Nigeria, in the same way that a white person from rural Vermont has a different perspective than a white person from Houston, Texas. Yet, universities' racial policies suggest that racial identity alone constitutes the being of the race or the man. J. Barzun, Race: A Study in Modern Superstition 114 (1937). That is the same naked racism upon which segregation itself was built. Small wonder, then, that these policies are leading to increasing racial polarization and friction. This kind of reductionist logic leads directly to the disregard for what does not jibe with preconceived theory, providing a cloak to conceal complexity, argument to the crown for praising or damning without the trouble of going into details—such as details about an individual's ideas or unique background. Ibid. Rather than forming a more pluralistic society, these policies thus strip us of our individuality and undermine the very diversity of thought that universities purport to seek.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,287,"The solution to our Nation's racial problems thus cannot come from policies grounded in affirmative action or some other conception of equity. Racialism simply cannot be undone by different or more racialism. Instead, the solution announced in the second founding is incorporated in our Constitution: that we are all equal, and should be treated equally before the law without regard to our race. Only that promise can allow us to look past our differing skin colors and identities and see each other for what we truly are: individuals with unique thoughts, perspectives, and goals, but with equal dignity and equal rights under the law.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,289,"Justice JACKSON has a different view. Rather than focusing on individuals as individuals, her dissent focuses on the historical subjugation of black Americans, invoking statistical racial gaps to argue in favor of defining and categorizing individuals by their race.

This is so, she writes, because of statistical disparities among different racial groups. See post, at 2268-2270.

Put simply, the fate of abstract categories of wealth statistics is not the same as the fate of a given set of flesh-and-blood human beings. T. Sowell, Wealth, Poverty and Politics 333 (2016). Worse still, Justice JACKSON uses her broad observations about statistical relationships between race and select measures of health, wealth, and well-being to label all blacks as victims. Her desire to do so is unfathomable to me. I cannot deny the great accomplishments of black Americans, including those who succeeded despite long odds.",Thomas,0,

Of course, none of those statistics are capable of drawing a direct causal link between race—rather than socioeconomic status or any other factor—and individual outcomes. So Justice JACKSON supplies the link herself: the legacy of slavery and the nature of inherited wealth. This, she claims, locks blacks into a seemingly perpetual inferior caste. Such a view is irrational, it is an insult to individual achievement and cancerous to young minds seeking to push through barriers, rather than consign themselves to permanent victimhood. If an applicant has less financial means (because of generational inheritance or otherwise), then surely a university may take that into account. If an applicant has medical struggles or a family member with medical concerns, a university may consider that too.",Thomas,0,

What matters is not the barriers they face, but how they choose to confront them. And their race is not to blame for everything—good or bad—that happens in their lives. A contrary, myopic world view based on individuals' skin color to the total exclusion of their personal choices is nothing short of racial determinism.",Thomas,0,

Start with the obvious: If social reorganization in the name of equality may be justified by the mere fact of statistical disparities among racial groups, then that reorganization must continue until these disparities are fully eliminated, regardless of the reasons for the disparities and the cost of their elimination. If blacks fail a test at higher rates than their white counterparts (regardless of whether the reason for the disparity has anything at all to do with race), the only solution will be race-focused measures. If those measures were to result in blacks failing at yet higher rates, the only solution would be to double down. In fact, there would seem to be no logical limit to what the government may do to level the racial playing field—outright wealth transfers, quota systems, and racial preferences would all seem permissible. In such a system, it would not matter how many innocents suffer race-based injuries, all that would matter is reaching the race-based goal.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,300,"Worse, the classifications that Justice JACKSON draws are themselves race-based stereotypes. She focuses on two hypothetical applicants, John and James, competing for admission to UNC. John is a white, seventh-generation legacy at the school, while James is black and would be the first in his family to attend UNC. Post, at 2264. Justice JACKSON argues that race-conscious admission programs are necessary to adequately compare the two applicants. As an initial matter, it is not clear why James's race is the only factor that could encourage UNC to admit him, his status as a first-generation college applicant seems to contextualize his application. But, setting that aside, why is it that John should be judged based on the actions of his great-great-great-grandparents? And what would Justice JACKSON say to John when deeming him not as worthy of admission: Some statistically significant number of white people had advantages in college admissions seven generations  ago, and you have inherited their incurable sin?",Thomas,0,
2022-009,301,"Nor should we accept that John or James represent all members of their respective races. All racial groups are heterogeneous, and blacks are no exception— encompassing northerners and southerners, rich and poor, and recent immigrants and descendants of slaves. See, e.g., T. Sowell, Ethnic America 220 (1981) (noting that the great success of West Indian immigrants to the United States—disproportionate among blacks more broadly—seriously undermines the proposition that color is a fatal handicap in the American economy). Eschewing the complexity that comes with individuality may make for an uncomplicated narrative, but lumping people together and judging them based on assumed inherited or ancestral traits is nothing but stereotyping.11",Thomas,0,
2022-009,302,"To further illustrate, let's expand the applicant pool beyond John and James. Consider Jack, a black applicant and the son of a multimillionaire industrialist. In a world of race-based preferences, James' seat could very well go to Jack rather than John—both are black, after all. And what about members of the numerous other racial and ethnic groups in our Nation? What about Anne, the child of Chinese immigrants? Jacob, the grandchild of Holocaust survivors who escaped to this Nation with nothing and faced discrimination upon arrival? Or Thomas, the great-grandchild of Irish immigrants escaping famine? While articulating her black and white world (literally), Justice JACKSON ignores the experiences of other immigrant groups (like Asians, see supra, at 2199-2200) and white communities that have faced historic barriers.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,303,"Though Justice JACKSON seems to think that her race-based theory can somehow benefit everyone, it is an immutable fact that every time the government uses racial criteria to `bring the races together,' someone gets excluded, and the person excluded suffers an injury solely because of his or her race. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 759, 127 S.Ct. 2738 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citation omitted). Indeed, Justice JACKSON seems to have no response —no explanation at all—for the people who will shoulder that burden. How, for example, would Justice JACKSON explain the need for race-based preferences to the Chinese student who has worked hard his whole life, only to be denied college admission in part because of his skin color? If such a burden would seem difficult to impose on a bright-eyed young person, that's because it should be. History has taught us to abhor theories that call for elites to pick racial winners and losers in the name of sociological experimentation.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,304,"Nor is it clear what another few generations of race-conscious college admissions may be expected to accomplish. Even today, affirmative action programs that offer an admissions boost to black and Hispanic students discriminate against those who identify themselves as members of other races that do not receive such preferential treatment. Must others in the future make sacrifices to re-level the playing field for this new phase of racial subordination? And then, out of whose lives should the debt owed to those further victims be repaid? This vision of meeting social racism with government-imposed racism is thus self-defeating, resulting in a never-ending cycle of victimization. There is no reason to  continue down that path. In the wake of the Civil War, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment charted a way out: a colorblind Constitution that requires the government to, at long last, put aside its citizens' skin color and focus on their individual achievements.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,306,"Universities' recent experiences confirm the efficacy of a colorblind rule. To start, universities prohibited from engaging in racial discrimination by state law continue to enroll racially diverse classes by race-neutral means. For example, the University of California purportedly recently admitted its most diverse undergraduate class ever, despite California's ban on racial preferences. T. Watanabe, UC Admits Largest, Most Diverse Class Ever, But It Was Harder To Get Accepted, L. A. Times, July 20, 2021, p. A1.

In fact, at least one set of studies suggests that, when we consider the higher education system as a whole, it is clear that the vast majority of schools would be as racially integrated, or more racially integrated, under a system of no preferences than under a system of large preferences.

Race-neutral policies may thus achieve the same benefits of racial harmony and equality without any of the burdens and strife generated by affirmative action policies.",Thomas,0,
2022-009,307,"In fact, meritocratic systems have long refuted bigoted misperceptions of what black students can accomplish.

Meritocratic systems, with objective grading scales, are critical to that belief. Such scales have always been a great equalizer —offering a metric for achievement that bigotry could not alter.

I write to emphasize that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not either.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,317,"Few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1731, 1737, 207 L.Ed.2d 218 (2020). Title VI of that law contains terms as powerful as they are easy to understand: No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. The message for these cases is unmistakable. Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) brought claims against Harvard and UNC under Title VI. That law applies to both institutions, as they elect to receive millions of dollars of federal assistance annually. And the trial records reveal that both schools routinely discriminate on the basis of race when choosing new students—exactly what the law forbids.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,319,"When a party seeks relief under a statute, our task is to apply the law's terms as a reasonable reader would have understood them at the time Congress enacted them. After all, only the words on the page constitute the law adopted by Congress and approved by the President. Bostock, 590 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1738.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,320,"The key phrases in Title VI at issue here are subjected to discrimination and on the ground of. Begin with the first. To discriminate against a person meant in 1964 what it means today: to treat that individual worse than others who are similarly situated. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1740, see also Webster's New International Dictionary 745 (2d ed. 1954) (to make a distinction or to make a difference in treatment or favor (of one as compared with others)), Webster's Third New International Dictionary 648 (1961) (to make a difference in treatment or favor on a class or categorical basis). The provision of Title VI before us, this Court has also held, prohibits only intentional discrimination. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001). From this, we can safely say that Title VI forbids a recipient of federal funds from intentionally treating one person worse than another similarly situated person on the ground of race, color, or national origin.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,321,"What does the statute's second critical phrase—on the ground of —mean? Again, the answer is uncomplicated: It means because of. See, e.g., Webster's New World Dictionary 640 (1960) (because of), Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 1002 (defining grounds as a logical condition, physical  cause, or metaphysical basis). Because of is a familiar phrase in the law, one we often apply in cases arising under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and one that we usually understand to invoke the `simple' and `traditional' standard of but-for causation. Bostock, 590 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1739 (quoting University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v.

Nor may a defendant avoid liability just by citing some other factor that contributed to the plaintiff's loss. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1739.

Title VI prohibits a recipient of federal funds from intentionally treating one person worse than another similarly situated person because of his race, color, or national origin. It does not matter if the recipient can point to some other  factor that contributed to its decision to disfavor that individual. Id., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1743-1745.

Bostock, 590 U. S., at ___, ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1743, 1744. Title VI prohibits a recipient of federal funds from intentionally treating any individual worse even in part because of his race, color, or national origin and without regard to any other reason or motive the recipient might assert. Without question, Congress in 1964 could have taken the law in various directions. But to safeguard the civil rights of all Americans, Congress chose a simple and profound rule.

2022-009,323,"If this exposition of Title VI sounds familiar, it should. Just next door, in Title VII, Congress made it unlawful  for an employer  to discriminate against any individual  because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Appreciating the breadth of this provision, just three years ago this Court read its essentially identical terms the same way. See Bostock, 590 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1738-1741. This Court has long recognized, too, that when Congress uses the same terms in the same statute, we should presume they have the same meaning. IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005).

2022-009,328,"Where do these boxes come from? Bureaucrats. A federal interagency commission devised this scheme of classifications in the 1970s to facilitate data collection. See D.

That commission acted without any input from anthropologists, sociologists, ethnologists, or other experts. Brief for David E. Bernstein as Amicus Curiae 3 (Bernstein Amicus Brief). Recognizing the limitations of their work, federal regulators cautioned that their classifications should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature, nor should they be viewed as determinants of eligibility for participation in any Federal program. 43 Fed. Reg. 19269 (emphasis added). Despite that warning, others eventually used this classification system for that very purpose—to sort out winners and losers in a process that, by the end of the century, would grant preferences in jobs  and university admissions. H. Graham, The Origins of Official Minority Designation, in The New Race Question: How the Census Counts Multiracial Individuals 289 (J. Perlmann & M. Waters eds. 2002).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,329,"These classifications rest on incoherent stereotypes. Take the Asian category.

Bernstein Amicus Brief 2, 5. This agglomeration of so many peoples paves over countless differences in language, culture, and historical experience. Id., at 5-6.

Consider, as well, the development of a separate category for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. It seems federal officials disaggregated these groups from the Asian category only in the 1990s and only in response to political lobbying. Bernstein Amicus Brief 9-10.

See Bernstein Amicus Brief 10-11. The White category sweeps in anyone from Europe, Asia west of India, and North Africa. Id., at 14. That includes those of Welsh, Norwegian, Greek, Italian, Moroccan, Lebanese, Turkish, or Iranian descent. It embraces an Iraqi or Ukrainian refugee as much as a member of the British royal family.

Id., at 600. The district court found that UNC's admissions policies mandate that race is taken into consideration in this process as a `plus' factor. Id., at 594-595. It is a plus that is sometimes awarded to underrepresented minority or URM candidates —a group UNC defines to include `those students identifying themselves as African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Hispanic, Latino, or Latina,' but not Asian or white students. Id., at 591-592, n. 7, 601.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,340,"At UNC, the admissions officers' decisions to admit or deny are `provisionally final.' Ante, at 2155-2156 (opinion for the Court). The decisions become truly final only after a committee approves or rejects them. 567 F.Supp.3d at 599. That committee may consider an applicant's race too. Id., at 607. In the end, the district court found that race plays a role—perhaps even a determinative role—in the decision to admit or deny some URM students. Id., at 634, see also id., at 662 (race may tip the scale). Nor is this an accident. As at Harvard, officials at UNC have made a deliberate decision to employ race-conscious admissions practices. Id., at 588-589.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,341,"While the district courts' findings tell the full story, one can also get a glimpse from aggregate statistics. Consider the chart in the Court's opinion collecting Harvard's data for the period 2009 to 2018. Ante, at 2171. The racial composition of each incoming class remained steady over that time—remarkably so. The proportion of African Americans hovered between 10% and 12%, the proportion of Hispanics between 8% and 12%, and the proportion of Asian Americans between 17% and 20%. Ibid. Might this merely reflect the demographics of the school's applicant pool? Cf. post, at 2244 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). Perhaps—at least assuming the applicant pool looks much the same each year and the school rather mechanically admits applicants based on objective criteria. But the possibility that it instead betrays the school's persistent focus on numbers of this race and numbers of that race is entirely consistent with the findings recounted above. See, e.g., 397 F.Supp.3d at 146 (if at some point in the admissions process it appears that a group is notably underrepresented or has suffered a dramatic drop off relative to the prior year, the committee may decide to give additional attention to applications from students within that group), cf. ante, at 2171, n. 7 (opinion for the Court).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,343,"Throughout this litigation, the parties have spent less time contesting these facts than debating other matters.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,344,"For example, the parties debate how much of a role race plays in admissions at Harvard and UNC. Both schools insist that they consider race as just one of many factors when making admissions decisions in their self-described holistic review of each applicant. SFFA responds with trial evidence showing that, whatever label the universities use to describe their processes, they intentionally consult race and, by design, their race-based tips and plusses benefit applicants of certain groups to the detriment of others. See Brief for Petitioner 20-35, 40-45.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,345,"The parties also debate the reasons both schools consult race. SFFA observes that, in the 1920s, Harvard began moving away from test scores and toward placing greater emphasis on character, fitness, and other subjective criteria. Id., at 12-13 (internal quotation marks omitted). Harvard made this move, SFFA asserts, because President A. Lawrence Lowell and other university leaders had become alarmed by the growing number of Jewish students who were testing in, and they sought some way to cap the number of Jewish students without `stating frankly' that they were `directly excluding all Jews beyond a certain percentage.' Id., at 12, see also 3 App. in No. 20-1199, pp. 1131-1133. SFFA contends that Harvard's current holistic approach to admissions works similarly to disguise the school's efforts to assemble classes with a particular racial composition—and, in particular, to limit the number of Asian Americans it admits. Brief for Petitioner 12-14, 25-32. For its part, Harvard expresses regret for its past practices while denying that they resemble its current ones. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20-1199, at 51. And both schools insist that their student bodies would lack sufficient diversity without race-conscious admissions. Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, pp. 52-54, Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, pp. 54-59.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,346,"When it comes to defining and measuring diversity, the parties spar too. SFFA observes that the racial categories the universities employ in the name of diversity do not begin to reflect the differences that exist within each group. See Part I-B-1, supra. Instead, they lump together white and Asian students from privileged backgrounds with Jewish, Irish, Polish, or other `white' ethnic groups whose ancestors faced discrimination and descendants of those Japanese-American citizens interned during World War II. Ante, at 2200, n. 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Even putting all that aside, SFFA stresses that neither Harvard nor UNC is willing to quantify how much racial and ethnic diversity they think sufficient. And, SFFA contends, the universities may not wish to do so because their stated goal implies a desire to admit some fixed number (or quota) of students from each racial group. See Brief for Petitioner 77, 80, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, p. 180. Besides, SFFA asks, if it is diversity the schools are after, why do they exhibit so little interest in other (non-racial) markers of it? See Brief for Petitioner 78, 83-86. While Harvard professes interest in socioeconomic diversity, for example, SFFA points to trial testimony that there are 23 times as many rich kids on campus as poor kids. 2 App. in No. 20-1199, p. 756.3  Even beyond all this, the parties debate the availability of alternatives. SFFA contends that both Harvard and UNC could obtain significant racial diversity without resorting to race-based admissions practices. Many other universities across the country, SFFA points out, have sought to do just that by reducing legacy preferences, increasing financial aid, and the like. Brief for Petitioner 85-86, see also Brief for Oklahoma et al. as Amici Curiae 9-19.4 As part of its affirmative case, SFFA also submitted evidence that Harvard could nearly replicate the current racial composition of its student body without resorting to race-based practices if it: (1) provided socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants just half of the tip it gives recruited athletes, and (2) eliminated tips for the children of donors, alumni, and faculty. Brief for Petitioner 33-34, 81, see 2 App. in No. 20-1199, at 763-765, 774-775. Doing these two things would barely affect the academic credentials of each incoming class. Brief for Petitioner 33-34. And it would not require Harvard to end tips for recruited athletes, who as a group are much weaker academically than non-athletes.5",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,347,"At trial, however, Harvard resisted this proposal. Its preferences for the children of donors, alumni, and faculty are no help to applicants who cannot boast of their parents' good fortune or trips to the alumni tent all their lives. While race-neutral on their face, too, these preferences undoubtedly benefit white and wealthy applicants the most. See 980 F.3d at 171. Still, Harvard stands by them. See Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, at 52-54, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-1199, at 48-49. As a result, athletes and the children of donors, alumni, and faculty—groups that together make up less than 5% of applicants to Harvard—constitute around 30% of the applicants admitted each year. 980 F.3d at 171.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,348,"To be sure, the parties' debates raise some hard-to-answer questions. Just how many admissions decisions turn on race? And what really motivates the universities' race-conscious admissions policies and their refusal to modify other preferential practices? Fortunately, Title VI does not require an answer to any of these questions. It does not ask how much a recipient of federal funds discriminates. It does not scrutinize a recipient's reasons or motives  for discriminating. Instead, the law prohibits covered institutions from intentionally treating any individual worse even in part because of race. So yes, of course, the universities consider many non-racial factors in their admissions processes too. And perhaps they mean well when they favor certain candidates over others based on the color of their skin. But even if all that is true, their conduct violates Title VI just the same. See Part I-A, supra, see also Bostock, 590 U. S., at ___, ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1739-1740, 1742-1745.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,350,"The principal dissent contends that this understanding of Title VI is contrary to precedent. Post, at 2239, n. 21 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But the dissent does not dispute that everything said here about the meaning of Title VI tracks this Court's precedent in Bostock interpreting materially identical language in Title VII. That raises two questions: Do the dissenters think Bostock wrongly decided? Or do they read the same words in neighboring provisions of the same statute—enacted at the same time by the same Congress—to mean different things? Apparently, the federal government takes the latter view. The Solicitor General insists that there is ambiguity in the term `discrimination' in Title VI but no ambiguity in the term discriminate in Title VII. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-707, at 164. Respectfully, I do not see it. The words of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are not like mood rings, they do not change their message from one moment to the next.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,351,"Rather than engage with the statutory text or our precedent in Bostock, the principal dissent seeks to sow confusion about the facts. It insists that all applicants to Harvard and UNC are eligible to receive a race-based tip. Post, at 2243, n. 27 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), cf. post, at 2272 (JACKSON, J., dissenting). But the question in these cases is not who could hypothetically receive a race-based tip. It is who actually receives one. And on that score the lower courts left no doubt. The district court in the Harvard case found that the school's admissions policy cannot be considered facially neutral from a Title VI perspective given that admissions officers provide race-based tips to African American and Hispanic applicants, while white and Asian American applicants are unlikely to receive a meaningful race-based tip. 397 F.Supp.3d at 190, n. 56, see also id., at 189-190 (Harvard's admissions process is not facially neutral.). Likewise, the district court in the UNC case found that admissions officers sometimes award race-based plusses to URM candidates —a category that excludes Asian American and white students. 567 F.Supp.3d at 591-592, n. 7, 601.6",Gorsuch,0,

Post, at 2243, n. 27 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (emphasis  added). Forget for a moment the universities' concessions about how they deliberately consult race when deciding whom to admit. See supra, at 2213-2214.7 Look past the lower courts' findings recounted above about how the universities intentionally give tips to students of some races and not others. See supra, at 2211-2214, 2215-2217. Put to the side telling evidence that came out in discovery.8 Ignore, too, our many precedents holding that it does not matter how a defendant labels its practices, Bostock, 590 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1743-1744, that intentional discrimination between individuals is unlawful whether motivated by a wish to achieve classwide equality or any other purpose, id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1743, and that the absence of a malevolent motive does not convert a facially discriminatory policy into a neutral policy with a merely discriminatory effect, Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 199, 111 S.Ct. 1196. Consider just the dissents in these cases. From start to finish and over the course of nearly 100 pages, they defend the universities' purposeful discrimination between applicants based on race. Neutrality, they insist, is not enough. Post, at 2231, 2262-2263 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), cf. post, at 2274-2275 (opinion of JACKSON, J.). The use of race, they stress, is critical.

2022-009,356,"Bakke concerned admissions to the medical school at the University of California,  Davis. That school set aside a certain number of spots in each class for minority applicants. See 438 U.S. at 272-276, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (opinion of Powell, J.). Allan Bakke argued that the school's policy violated Title VI and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 270, 98 S.Ct. 2733. The Court agreed with Mr. Bakke. In a fractured decision that yielded six opinions, a majority of the Court held that the school's set-aside system went too far. At the same time, however, a different coalition of five Justices ventured beyond the facts of the case to suggest that, in other circumstances not at issue, universities may sometimes permissibly use race in their admissions processes. See ante, at 2162-2164 (opinion for the Court).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,357,"As important as these conclusions were some of the interpretive moves made along the way. Justice Powell (writing only for himself) and Justice Brennan (writing for himself and three others) argued that Title VI is coterminous with the Equal Protection Clause. Put differently, they read Title VI to prohibit recipients of federal funds from doing whatever the Equal Protection Clause prohibits States from doing. Justice Powell and Justice Brennan then proceeded to evaluate racial preferences in higher education directly under the Equal Protection Clause. From there, however, their paths diverged. Justice Powell thought some racial preferences might be permissible but that the admissions program at issue violated the promise of equal protection. 438 U.S. at 315-320, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Justice Brennan would have given a wider berth to racial preferences and allowed the challenged program to proceed. Id., at 355-379, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,358,"Justice Stevens (also writing for himself and three others) took an altogether different approach. He began by noting the Court's settled practice of avoiding the decision of a constitutional issue if a case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground. Id., at 411, 98 S.Ct. 2733. He then turned to the broad prohibition of Title VI, id., at 413, 98 S.Ct. 2733, and summarized his views this way: The University excluded Bakke from participation in its program of medical education because of his race. The University also acknowledges that it was, and still is, receiving federal financial assistance. The plain language of the statute therefore requires finding a Title VI violation. Id., at 412, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (footnote omitted).",Gorsuch,0,

2022-009,362,"Within higher education, however, an entirely distinct set of rules emerged. Following Bakke, this Court declared that judges may simply defer to a school's assertion that diversity is essential to its educational mission. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Not all schools, though—elementary and secondary schools apparently do not qualify for this deference. See Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 724-725, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 168 L.Ed.2d 508 (2007). Only colleges and universities, the Court explained, occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 329, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Yet even they (wielding their special niche authority) cannot simply assert an interest in diversity and discriminate as they please. Fisher, 579 U.S. at 381, 136 S.Ct. 2198. Instead, they may consider race only as a plus factor for the purpose of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students or a diverse student body. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 335-336, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks omitted). At the same time, the Court cautioned, this practice must have a logical end point. Id., at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325. And in the meantime, outright racial balancing and quota systems remain patently unconstitutional. Id., at 330, 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Nor may a college or university ever provide mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses. Id., at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks omitted).

2022-009,369,"In other respects, however, the relative scope of the two provisions is inverted. The Equal Protection Clause addresses all manner of distinctions between persons and this Court has held that it implies different degrees of judicial scrutiny for different kinds of classifications. So, for example, courts apply strict scrutiny for classifications based on race, color, and national origin, intermediate scrutiny for classifications based on sex, and rational-basis review for classifications based on more prosaic grounds. See, e.g., Fisher, 579 U.S. at 376, 136 S.Ct. 2198, Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493-495, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (plurality opinion), United States v.

By contrast, Title VI targets only certain classifications—those based on race, color, or national origin. And that law does not direct courts to subject these classifications to one degree of scrutiny or another. Instead, as we have seen, its rule is as uncomplicated as it is momentous. Under Title VI, it is always unlawful to discriminate among persons even in part because of race, color, or national origin.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,370,"In truth, neither Justice Powell's nor Justice Brennan's opinion in Bakke focused on the text of Title VI.

Along the way, as Justice Stevens documented, both opinions did more than a little cherry-picking from the legislative record. See id., at 413-417, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Justice Brennan went so far as to declare that any claim that the use of racial criteria is barred by the plain language of the statute must fail in light of the remedial purpose of Title VI and its legislative history. Id., at 340, 98 S.Ct. 2733. And once liberated from the statute's firm rule against discrimination based on race, both opinions proceeded to devise their own and very different arrangements in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-009,371,"The moves made in Bakke were not statutory interpretation. They were judicial improvisation. Under our Constitution, judges have never been entitled to disregard the plain terms of a valid congressional enactment based on surmise about unenacted legislative intentions.

The Court recognized the barriers that some minority applicants to universities still faced as of 2003, notwithstanding the progress made since Bakke. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The Court stressed, however, that there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference  itself. Id., at 341, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The requirement of a time limit reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.

Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the Court authorized race-based student assignments for several decades—but not indefinitely into the future.

2022-009,403,"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment enshrines a guarantee of racial equality. The Court long ago concluded that this guarantee can be enforced through race-conscious means in a society that is not, and has never been, colorblind. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the Court recognized the constitutional necessity of racially integrated schools in light of the harm inflicted by segregation and the importance of education to our democratic society. Id., at 492-495, 74 S.Ct. 686. For 45 years, the Court extended Brown's transformative legacy to the context of higher education, allowing colleges and universities to consider race in a limited way and for the limited purpose of promoting the important benefits of racial diversity. This limited use of race has helped equalize educational opportunities for all students of every race and background and has improved racial diversity on college campuses. Although progress has been slow and imperfect, race-conscious college admissions policies have advanced the Constitution's guarantee of equality and have promoted Brown's vision of a Nation with more inclusive schools.",Sotomayor,0,

It holds that race can no longer be used in a limited way in college admissions to achieve such critical benefits. In so holding, the Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter. The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society. Because the Court's opinion is not grounded in law or fact and contravenes the vision of equality embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, I dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,407,"Equal educational opportunity is a prerequisite to achieving racial equality in our Nation. From its founding, the United States was a new experiment in a republican form of government where democratic participation and the capacity to engage in self-rule were vital. At the same time, American society was structured around the profitable institution that was slavery, which the original Constitution protected. The Constitution initially limited the power of Congress to restrict the slave trade, Art. I, § 9, cl. 1, accorded Southern States additional electoral power by counting three-fifths of their enslaved population in apportioning congressional seats, § 2, cl. 3, and gave enslavers the right to retrieve enslaved people who escaped to free States, Art. IV, § 2, cl. 3. Because a foundational pillar of slavery was the racist notion that Black people are a subordinate class with intellectual inferiority, Southern States sought to ensure slavery's longevity by prohibiting the education of Black people, whether enslaved or free. See H. Williams, Self-Taught: African American Education in Slavery and Freedom 7, 203-213 (2005) (Self-Taught). Thus, from this Nation's birth, the freedom to learn was neither colorblind nor equal.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,408,"With time, and at the tremendous cost of the Civil War, abolition came. More than two centuries after the first African enslaved persons were forcibly brought to our shores, Congress adopted the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime. § 1. Like all great historical transformations, emancipation was a movement, not a single event owed to any single individual, institution, or political party. E. Foner, The Second Founding 21, 51-54 (2019) (The Second Founding).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,409,"The fight for equal educational opportunity, however, was a key driver. Literacy was an instrument of resistance and liberation. Self-Taught 8. Education provided the means to write a pass to freedom and to learn of abolitionist activities. Id., at 7, 91 S.Ct. 1267. It allowed enslaved Black people to disturb the power relations between master and slave, which fused their desire for literacy with their desire for freedom. Ibid. Put simply, the very feeling of inferiority which slavery forced upon Black people fathered an intense desire to rise out of their condition by means of education. W. E. B. Du Bois, Black Reconstruction in America 1860-1880, 111 S.Ct. 1196, p. 638 (1935), see J. Anderson, The Education of Blacks in the South 1860-1935, p. 7 (1988). Black Americans thus insisted, in the words of Frederick Douglass, that in a country governed by the people, like ours, education of the youth of all classes is vital to its welfare, prosperity, and to its existence. Address to the People of the United States (1883), in 4 P. Foner, The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass 386 (1955). Black people's yearning for freedom of thought, and  for a more perfect Union with educational opportunity for all, played a crucial role during the Reconstruction era.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,410,"Yet emancipation marked the beginning, not the end, of that era. Abolition alone could not repair centuries of racial subjugation. Following the Thirteenth Amendment's ratification, the Southern States replaced slavery with a system of `laws which imposed upon Black people onerous disabilities and burdens, and curtailed their rights in the pursuit of life, liberty, and property to such an extent that their freedom was of little value.' Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 390, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Marshall, J.) (quoting Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 70, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873)).

Laws pp. 99, 102.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,411,"Moreover, the criminal punishment exception in the Thirteenth Amendment facilitated the creation of a new system of forced labor in the South. Southern States expanded their criminal laws, which in turn permitted involuntary servitude as a punishment for convicted Black persons. D. Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans From the Civil War to World War II, pp. 7, 53 (2009) (Slavery by Another Name). States required, for example, that Black people sign a labor contract to work for a white employer or face prosecution for vagrancy. The Second Founding 48. State laws then forced Black convicted persons to labor in plantations, mines, and industries in the South. Id., at 50. This system of free forced labor provided tremendous benefits to Southern whites and was designed to intimidate, subjugate, and control newly emancipated Black people.

2022-009,413,"Congress acted on that recommendation and adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. Proponents of the Amendment declared that one of its key goals was to protect the black man in his fundamental rights as a citizen with the same shield which it throws over the white man. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2766 (1866) (Cong. Globe) (statement of Sen. Howard). That is, the Amendment sought to secure to a race recently emancipated, a race that through many generations was held in slavery, all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 555-556, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,414,"To promote this goal, Congress enshrined a broad guarantee of equality in the Equal Protection Clause of the Amendment. That Clause commands that no State shall  deny to any person  within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Amdt. 14, § 1. Congress chose its words carefully, opting for expansive language that focused on equal protection and rejecting proposals that would have made the Constitution explicitly color-blind. A. Kull, The Color-Blind Constitution 69 (1992), see also, e.g., Cong. Globe 1287 (rejecting proposed language providing that no State  shall  recognize any distinction between citizens  on account of race or color). This choice makes it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment does not impose a blanket ban on race-conscious policies.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,415,"Simultaneously with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress enacted a number of race-conscious laws to fulfill the Amendment's promise of equality, leaving no doubt that the Equal Protection Clause permits consideration of race to achieve its goal. One such law was the Freedmen's Bureau Act, enacted in 1865 and then expanded in 1866, which established a federal agency to provide certain benefits to refugees and newly emancipated freedmen. See Act of Mar. 3, 1865, ch. 90, 13 Stat. 507, Act of July 16, 1866, ch. 200, 14 Stat. 173. For the Bureau, education was the foundation upon which all efforts to assist the freedmen rested. E. Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877, p. 144 (1988). Consistent with that view, the Bureau provided essential funding for black education during Reconstruction. Id., at 97.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,416,"Black people were the targeted beneficiaries of the Bureau's programs, especially when it came to investments in education in the wake of the Civil War. Each year surrounding the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bureau educated approximately 100,000 students, nearly all of them black, and regardless of degree of past disadvantage. E. Schnapper, Affirmative Action and the Legislative History of the Fourteenth Amendment, 71 Va. L. Rev. 753, 781 (1985). The Bureau also provided land and funding to establish some of our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Ibid., see also Brief for HBCU Leaders et al. as Amici Curiae 13 (HBCU Brief). In 1867, for example, the Bureau provided Howard University tens of thousands of dollars to buy property and construct its campus in our Nation's capital. 2 O. Howard, Autobiography 397-401 (1907). Howard University was designed to provide special opportunities for a higher education to the newly enfranchised of the south, but it was available to all Black people, whatever may have been their previous condition. Bureau Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, Sixth Semi-Annual Report on Schools for Freedmen 60 (July 1, 1868).1 The Bureau also expended a total of $407,752.21 on black colleges, and only $3,000 on white colleges from 1867 to 1870. Schnapper, 71 Va. L. Rev., at 798, n. 149.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,417,"Indeed, contemporaries understood that the Freedmen's Bureau Act benefited Black people. Supporters defended the law by stressing its race-conscious approach. See, e.g., Cong. Globe 632 (statement of Rep. Moulton) (The true object of this bill is the amelioration of the condition of the colored people), Joint Comm. Rep. 11 (reporting that the Union men of the south declared with one voice that the Bureau's efforts protected the colored people). Opponents argued that the Act  created harmful racial classifications that favored Black people and disfavored white Americans. See, e.g., Cong. Globe 397 (statement of Sen. Willey) (the Act makes a distinction on account of color between the two races), 544 (statement of Rep. Taylor) (the Act is legislation for a particular class of the blacks to the exclusion of all whites), App. to Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 69-70 (statement of Rep. Rousseau) (You raise a spirit of antagonism between the black race and the white race in our country, and the law-abiding will be powerless to control it). President Andrew Johnson vetoed the bill on the basis that it provided benefits to a particular class of citizens, 6 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 1789-1897, p. 425 (J. Richardson ed. 1897) (Messages & Papers) (A. Johnson to House of Rep. July 16, 1866), but Congress overrode his veto. Cong. Globe 3849-3850. Thus, rejecting those opponents' objections, the same Reconstruction Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment eschewed the concept of colorblindness as sufficient to remedy inequality in education.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,418,"Congress also debated and passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 contemporaneously with the Fourteenth Amendment. The goal of that Act was to eradicate the Black Codes enacted by Southern States following ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. See id., at 474. Because the Black Codes focused on race, not just slavery-related status, the Civil Rights Act explicitly recognized that white citizens enjoyed certain rights that non-white citizens did not. Section 1 of the Act provided that all persons of every race and color  shall have the same rights as those enjoyed by white citizens. Act of Apr. 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27. Similarly, Section 2 established criminal penalties for subjecting racial minorities to different punishment  by reason of  color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons. Ibid. In other words, the Act was not colorblind. By using white citizens as a benchmark, the law classified by race and took account of the privileges enjoyed only by white people. As he did with the Freedmen's Bureau Act, President Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act in part because he viewed it as providing Black citizens with special treatment. See Messages and Papers 408, 413 (the Act is designed to afford discriminating protection to colored persons, and its distinction of race and color  operates in favor of the colored and against the white race). Again, Congress overrode his veto. Cong. Globe 1861. In fact, Congress reenacted race-conscious language in the Civil Rights Act of 1870, two years after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Act of May 31, 1870, § 16, 16 Stat. 144, where it remains today, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981(a) and 1982 (Rev.

2022-009,421,"The Reconstruction era marked a transformational point in the history of American democracy. Its vision of equal opportunity leading to an equal society was short-lived, however, with the assistance of this Court. Id., at 391, 98 S.Ct. 2733. In a series of decisions, the Court sharply curtailed the substantive protections of the Reconstruction Amendments and the Civil Rights Acts. Id., at 391-392, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (collecting cases). That endeavor culminated with the Court's shameful decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), which established that equality of treatment exists when the races are provided substantially equal facilities, even though these facilities be separate. Brown, 347 U.S. at 488, 74 S.Ct. 686. Therefore, with this Court's approval, government-enforced segregation and its concomitant destruction of equal opportunity became the constitutional norm and infected every sector of our society, from bathrooms to military units and, crucially, schools.

2022-009,422,"In a powerful dissent, Justice Harlan explained in Plessy that the Louisiana law at issue, which authorized segregation in railway carriages, perpetuated a caste system. 163 U.S. at 559-560, 16 S.Ct. 1138. Although the State argued that the law prescribed a rule applicable alike to white and colored citizens, all knew that the law's purpose was not to exclude white persons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, but to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons. Id., at 557, 16 S.Ct. 1138. That is, the law proceeded on the ground that colored citizens are so inferior and degraded that they cannot be allowed to sit in public coaches occupied by white citizens. Id., at 560, 16 S.Ct. 1138. Although the white race deems itself to be the dominant race  in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth, and in power, Justice Harlan explained, there is no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens in the eyes of the law. Id., at 559, 16 S.Ct. 1138. In that context, Justice Harlan thus announced his view that our constitution is color-blind. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,423,"It was not until half a century later, in Brown, that the Court honored the guarantee of equality in the Equal Protection Clause and Justice Harlan's vision of a Constitution that neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. Ibid. Considering the effects of segregation and the role of education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation, Brown overruled Plessy. 347 U.S. at 492-495, 74 S.Ct. 686. The Brown Court held that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, and that such racial segregation deprives Black students of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id.,  at 494-495, 74 S.Ct. 686. The Court thus ordered segregated schools to transition to a racially integrated system of public education with all deliberate speed, ordering the immediate admission of Black children to schools previously attended only by white children. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,424,"Brown was a race-conscious decision that emphasized the importance of education in our society. Central to the Court's holding was the recognition that, as Justice Harlan emphasized in Plessy, segregation perpetuates a caste system wherein Black children receive inferior educational opportunities solely because of their race, denoting inferiority as to their status in the community. 347 U.S. at 494, and n. 10, 74 S.Ct. 686. Moreover, because education is the very foundation of good citizenship, segregation in public education harms our democratic society more broadly as well. Id., at 493, 74 S.Ct. 686. In light of the harmful effects of entrenched racial subordination on racial minorities and American democracy, Brown recognized the constitutional necessity of a racially integrated system of schools where education is available to all on equal terms. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,425,"The desegregation cases that followed Brown confirm that the ultimate goal of that seminal decision was to achieve a system of integrated schools that ensured racial equality of opportunity, not to impose a formalistic rule of race-blindness. In Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), for example, the Court held that the New Kent County School Board's freedom of choice plan, which allegedly allowed every student, regardless of race, `freely' to choose the school he would attend, was insufficient to effectuate the command of Brown. Id., at 437, 441-442, 88 S.Ct. 1689. That command, the Court explained, was that schools dismantle well-entrenched dual systems and transition to a unitary, nonracial system of public education. Id., at 435-436, 88 S.Ct. 1689. That the board opened the doors of the former `white' school to Black children and the `Black' school to white children on a race-blind basis was not enough. Id., at 437, 88 S.Ct. 1689. Passively eliminating race classifications did not suffice when de facto segregation persisted. Id., at 440-442, 88 S.Ct. 1689 (noting that 85% of Black children in the school system were still attending an all-Black school). Instead, the board was clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch. Id., at 437-438, 88 S.Ct. 1689. Affirmative steps, this Court held, are constitutionally necessary when mere formal neutrality cannot achieve Brown's promise of racial equality. See Green, 391 U.S. at 440-442, 88 S.Ct. 1689, see also North Carolina Bd. of Ed. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45-46, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971) (holding that North Carolina statute that forbade the use of race in school busing exploits an apparently neutral form to control school assignment plans by directing that they be `colorblind', that requirement, against the background of segregation, would render illusory the promise of Brown), Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 538, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979) (school board had to do more than abandon its prior discriminatory purpose, it had an affirmative responsibility to integrate), Keyes v.

2022-009,426,"In so holding, this Court's post-Brown decisions rejected arguments advanced by opponents of integration suggesting that restoring race as a criterion in the operation of the public schools was at odds with the Brown decisions. Brief for Respondents in Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., O. T. 1967, No. 695, p. 6 (Green Brief). Those opponents argued that Brown only required the admission of Black students to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. Id., at 11 (emphasis deleted). Relying on Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy, they argued that the use of race is improper because the `Constitution is colorblind.' Green Brief 6, n. 6 (quoting Plessy, 163 U.S. at 559, 16 S.Ct. 1138 (Harlan, J., dissenting)). They also incorrectly claimed that their views aligned with those of the Brown litigators, arguing that the Brown plaintiffs understood that Brown's mandate was colorblindness. Green Brief 17. This Court rejected that characterization of the thrust of Brown. Green, 391 U.S. at 437, 88 S.Ct. 1689. It made clear that indifference to race is not an end in itself under that watershed decision. Id., at 440, 88 S.Ct. 1689. The ultimate goal is racial equality of opportunity.",Sotomayor,0,

Brief for NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 9. Justice Marshall joined the Bakke plurality and applauded the judgment of the Court that a university may consider race in its admissions process. 438 U.S. at 400, 98 S.Ct. 2733. In fact, Justice Marshall's view was that Bakke's holding should have been even more protective of race-conscious college admissions programs in light of the remedial purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment and the legacy of racial inequality in our society. See id., at 396-402, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (arguing that a class-based remedy should be constitutionally permissible in light of the hundreds of years of class-based discrimination against Black Americans). The Court's recharacterization of Brown is nothing but revisionist history and an affront to the legendary life of Justice Marshall, a great jurist who was a champion of true equal opportunity, not rhetorical flourishes about colorblindness.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,430,"Two decades after Brown, in Bakke, a plurality of the Court held that the attainment of a diverse student body is a compelling and constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education. 438 U.S. at 311-315, 98 S.Ct. 2733. Race could be considered in the college admissions process in pursuit of this goal, the plurality explained, if it is one factor of many in an applicant's file, and each applicant receives individualized review as part of a holistic admissions process. Id., at 316-318, 98 S.Ct. 2733.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,431,"Since Bakke, the Court has reaffirmed numerous times the constitutionality of limited race-conscious college admissions. First, in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003), a majority of the Court endorsed the Bakke plurality's view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions, 539 U.S. at 325, 123 S.Ct. 2325, and held that race may be used in a narrowly tailored manner to achieve this interest, id., at 333-344, 123 S.Ct. 2325, see also Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 268, 123 S.Ct. 2411, 156 L.Ed.2d 257 (2003) (for the reasons set forth the same day in Grutter, rejecting petitioners' arguments that race can only be considered in college admissions to remedy identified discrimination and that diversity is `too open-ended, ill-defined, and indefinite to constitute a compelling interest').",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,432,"Later, in the Fisher litigation, the Court twice reaffirmed that a limited use of race in college admissions is constitutionally permissible if it satisfies strict scrutiny. In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 133 S.Ct. 2411, 186 L.Ed.2d 474 (2013) (Fisher I), seven Members of the Court concluded that the use of race in college admissions comports with the Fourteenth Amendment if it is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.

University of Texas at Austin, 579 U.S. 365, 376, 136 S.Ct. 2198, 195 L.Ed.2d 511 (2016) (Fisher II), the Court upheld the admissions program at the University of Texas under this framework.

2022-009,433,"Bakke, Grutter, and Fisher are an extension of Brown's legacy. Those decisions recognize that `experience lends support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial.' Grutter, 539 U.S. at 324, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313, 98 S.Ct. 2733). Racially integrated schools improve cross-racial understanding, break down racial stereotypes, and ensure that students obtain the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. 539 U.S. at 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325. More broadly, inclusive institutions that are visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity instill public confidence in the legitimacy and integrity of those institutions and the diverse set of graduates that they cultivate. Id., at 332, 123 S.Ct. 2325. That is particularly true in the context of higher education, where colleges and universities play a critical role in maintaining the fabric of society and serve as the training ground for a large number of our Nation's leaders. Id., at 331-332, 123 S.Ct. 2325. It is thus an objective of the highest order, a compelling interest indeed, that universities pursue the benefits of racial diversity and ensure that the diffusion of knowledge and opportunity is available to students of all races. Id., at 328-333, 123 S.Ct. 2325.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,434,"This compelling interest in student body diversity is grounded not only in the Court's equal protection jurisprudence but  also in principles of academic freedom, which `long have been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.' Id., at 324, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312, 98 S.Ct. 2733). In light of the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, this Court's precedents recognize the imperative nature of diverse student bodies on American college campuses. 539 U.S. at 329, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Consistent with the First Amendment, student body diversity allows universities to promote the robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues rather than through any kind of authoritative selection. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, as the Court recently reaffirmed in another school case, learning how to tolerate diverse expressive activities has always been `part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society' under our constitutional tradition.

2022-009,435,"In short, for more than four decades, it has been this Court's settled law that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes a limited use of race in college admissions in service of the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. From Brown to Fisher, this Court's cases have sought to equalize educational opportunity in a society structured by racial segregation and to advance the Fourteenth Amendment's vision of an America where racially integrated schools guarantee students of all races the equal protection of the laws.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,437,"Today, the Court concludes that indifference to race is the only constitutionally permissible means to achieve racial equality in college admissions. That interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is not only contrary to precedent and the entire teachings of our history, see supra, at 2225-2234, but is also grounded in the illusion that racial inequality was a problem of a different generation. Entrenched racial inequality remains a reality today. That is true for society writ large and, more specifically, for Harvard and the University of North Carolina (UNC), two institutions with a long history of racial exclusion. Ignoring race will not equalize a society that is racially unequal. What was true in the 1860s, and again in 1954, is true today: Equality requires acknowledgment of inequality.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,439,"After more than a century of government policies enforcing racial segregation by law, society remains highly segregated. About half of all Latino and Black students attend a racially homogeneous school with at least 75% minority student enrollment.4 The share of intensely segregated minority schools (i.e., schools that enroll 90% to 100% racial minorities) has sharply increased.5  To this day, the U. S. Department of Justice continues to enter into desegregation decrees with schools that have failed to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation.6",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,440,"Moreover, underrepresented minority students are more likely to live in poverty and attend schools with a high concentration of poverty.7 When combined with residential segregation and school funding systems that rely heavily on local property taxes, this leads to racial minority students attending schools with fewer resources. See San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 72-86, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting school funding disparities that result from local property taxation).8 In turn, underrepresented minorities are more likely to attend schools with less qualified teachers, less challenging curricula, lower standardized test scores, and fewer extracurricular activities and advanced placement courses.9 It is thus unsurprising that there are achievement gaps along racial lines, even after controlling for income differences.10",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,441,"Systemic inequities disadvantaging underrepresented racial minorities exist beyond school resources. Students of color, particularly Black students, are disproportionately disciplined or suspended, interrupting their academic progress and increasing their risk of involvement with the criminal justice system.11 Underrepresented minorities are less likely to have parents with a postsecondary education who may be familiar with the college application process.12 Further, low-income children of color are less likely to attend preschool and other early childhood education programs that increase educational attainment.13 All of these interlocked factors  place underrepresented minorities multiple steps behind the starting line in the race for college admissions.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,442,"In North Carolina, the home of UNC, racial inequality is deeply entrenched in K-12 education. State courts have consistently found that the State does not provide underrepresented racial minorities equal access to educational opportunities, and that racial disparities in public schooling have increased in recent years, in violation of the State Constitution.

Brief for 25 Harvard Student and Alumni Organizations as Amici Curiae 30-31, 2 App. 823, 961. For years, the university has reported that inequities on campus remain. See, e.g., 4 App. 1564-1601. For example, Harvard has reported that far too many black students at Harvard experience feelings of isolation and marginalization, 3 id., at 1308, and that student survey data showed that only half of Harvard undergraduates believe that the housing system fosters exchanges between students of different backgrounds, id., at 1309.* * *  These may be uncomfortable truths to some, but they are truths nonetheless. Institutions can and do change, however, as societal and legal changes force them to live up to their highest ideals. Harvard Report 56. It is against this historical backdrop that Harvard and UNC have reckoned with their past and its lingering effects. Acknowledging the reality that race has always mattered and continues to matter, these universities have established institutional goals of diversity and inclusion. Consistent with equal protection principles and this Court's settled law, their policies use race in a limited way with the goal of recruiting, admitting, and enrolling underrepresented racial minorities to pursue the well-documented benefits of racial integration in education.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,456,"The Court today stands in the way of respondents' commendable undertaking and entrenches racial inequality in higher education. The majority opinion does so by turning a blind eye to these truths and overruling decades of precedent, content for now to disguise its ruling as an application of established law and move on. Kennedy, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2450 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). As Justice THOMAS puts it, Grutter is, for all intents and purposes, overruled. Ante, at 2207.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,457,"It is a disturbing feature of today's decision that the Court does not even attempt to make the extraordinary showing required by stare decisis. The Court simply moves the goalposts, upsetting settled expectations and throwing admissions programs nationwide into turmoil. In the end, however, it is clear why the Court is forced to change the rules of the game to reach its desired outcome: Under a faithful application of the Court's settled legal framework, Harvard and UNC's admissions programs are constitutional and comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.21",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,459,"Answering the question whether Harvard's and UNC's policies survive strict scrutiny under settled law is straightforward, both because of the procedural posture  of these cases and because of the narrow scope of the issues presented by petitioner Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. (SFFA).22",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,460,"These cases arrived at this Court after two lengthy trials. Harvard and UNC introduced dozens of fact witnesses, expert testimony, and documentary evidence in support of their admissions programs. Brief for Petitioner 20, 40. SFFA, by contrast, did not introduce a single fact witness and relied on the testimony of two experts. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,461,"After making detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Courts entered judgment in favor of Harvard and UNC. See 397 F.Supp.3d 126, 133-206 (Mass. 2019) (Harvard I), 567 F.Supp.3d 580, 588-667 (MDNC 2021) (UNC). The First Circuit affirmed in the Harvard case, finding no error in the District Court's thorough opinion. 980 F.3d 157, 204 (2020) (Harvard II). SFFA then filed petitions for a writ of certiorari in both cases, which the Court granted. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 895, 211 L.Ed.2d 604 (2022).23",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,462,"The Court granted certiorari on three questions: (1) whether the Court should overrule Bakke, Grutter, and Fisher, or, alternatively, (2) whether UNC's admissions program is narrowly tailored, and (3) whether Harvard's admissions program is narrowly tailored. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 20-1199, p. i, Brief for Respondent in No. 20-1199, p. i, Brief for University Respondents in No. 21-707, p. i. Answering the last two questions, which call for application of settled law to the facts of these cases, is simple: Deferring to the lower courts' careful findings of fact and credibility determinations, Harvard's and UNC's policies are narrowly tailored.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,465,"As to narrow tailoring, the only issue SFFA raises in the UNC case is that the university cannot use race in its admissions process because race-neutral alternatives would promote UNC's diversity objectives. That issue is so easily resolved in favor of UNC that SFFA devoted only three pages to it at the end of its 87-page brief. Brief for Petitioner 83-86.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,466,"The use of race is narrowly tailored unless workable and available race-neutral approaches exist, meaning race-neutral alternatives promote the institution's diversity goals and do so at `tolerable administrative expense.' Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 312, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U.S. 267, 280, n. 6, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (plurality opinion)). Narrow tailoring does not mean perfect tailoring. The Court's precedents make clear that narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Nor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,467,"As the District Court found after considering extensive expert testimony, SFFA's  proposed race-neutral alternatives do not meet those criteria. UNC, 567 F.Supp.3d at 648. All of SFFA's proposals are methodologically flawed because they rest on `terribly unrealistic' assumptions about the applicant pools. Id., at 643-645, 647. For example, as to one set of proposals, SFFA's expert unrealistically assumed that all of the top students in the candidate pools he used would apply, be admitted, and enroll. Id., at 647. In addition, some of SFFA's proposals force UNC to abandon its holistic approach to college admissions, id., at 643-645, n. 43, a result in deep tension with the goal of educational diversity as this Court's cases have defined it, Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 386-387, 136 S.Ct. 2198. Others are largely impractical—not to mention unprecedented —in higher education. 567 F.Supp.3d at 647. SFFA's proposed top percentage plans,24 for example, are based on a made-up and complicated admissions index that requires UNC to access  real-time data for all high school students. Ibid. UNC is then supposed to use that index, which would change every time any student took a standardized test, to rank students based on grades and test scores. Ibid. One of SFFA's top percentage plans would even nearly erase the Native American incoming class at UNC. Id., at 646. The courts below correctly concluded that UNC is not required to adopt SFFA's unrealistic proposals to satisfy strict scrutiny.25",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,469,"Harvard's admissions program is also narrowly tailored under settled law. SFFA argues that Harvard's program is not narrowly tailored because the university has workable race-neutral alternatives, does not use race as a mere plus, and engages in racial balancing. Brief for Petitioner 75-83. As the First Circuit concluded, there was no error in the District Court's findings on any of these issues. Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 204.26  Like UNC, Harvard has already implemented many of SFFA's proposals, such as increasing recruitment efforts and financial aid for low-income students. Id., at 193. Also like UNC, Harvard carefully considered other race-neutral ways to achieve its diversity goals, but none of them are workable. Id., at 193-194. SFFA's argument before this Court is that Harvard should adopt a plan designed by SFFA's expert for purposes of trial, which increases preferences for low-income applicants and eliminates the use of race and legacy preferences. Id., at 193, Brief for Petitioner 81. Under SFFA's model, however, Black representation would plummet by about 32%, and the admitted share of applicants with high academic ratings would decrease, as would the share with high extracurricular and athletic ratings. 980 F.3d at 194. SFFA's proposal, echoed by Justice GORSUCH, ante, at 2214-2215, requires Harvard to make sacrifices on almost every dimension important to its admissions process, 980 F.3d at 194, and forces it to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence, Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 385, 136 S.Ct. 2198. Neither this Court's precedents nor common sense impose that type of burden on colleges and universities.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,470,"The courts below also properly rejected SFFA's argument that Harvard does not use race in the limited way this Court's precedents allow. The Court has explained that a university can consider a student's race in its admissions process so long as that use is contextual and does not operate as a mechanical plus factor. Id., at 375, 136 S.Ct. 2198. The Court has also repeatedly held that race, when considered as one factor of many in the context of holistic review, can make a difference to whether an application is accepted or rejected. Ibid. After all, race-conscious admissions seek to improve racial diversity. Race cannot, however, be `decisive' for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant. Gratz, 539 U.S. at 272, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317, 98 S.Ct. 2733).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,471,"That is precisely how Harvard's program operates. In recent years, Harvard has received about 35,000 applications for a class with about 1,600 seats. 980 F.3d at 165. The admissions process is exceedingly competitive, it involves six different application components. Those components include interviews with alumni and admissions officers, as well as consideration of a whole range of information, such as grades, test scores, recommendation letters, and personal essays, by several committees. Id., at 165-166. Consistent with that individualized, holistic review process, admissions officers may, but need not, consider a student's self-reported racial identity when assigning overall ratings. Id., at 166, 169, 180. Even after so many layers of competitive review, Harvard typically ends up with about 2,000 tentative admits, more students than the 1,600 or so that the university can admit. Id., at 170. To choose among those highly qualified candidates, Harvard considers plus factors, which can help tip an applicant into Harvard's admitted class. Id., at 170, 191. To diversify its class, Harvard awards tips for a variety of reasons, including geographic factors, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and race. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,472,"There is no evidence of any mechanical use of tips. Id., at 180. Consistent with the Court's precedents, Harvard properly considers race as part of a holistic review process, values all types of diversity, does not consider race exclusively, and does not award a fixed amount of points to applicants because of their race. Id., at  190.27 Indeed, Harvard's admissions process is so competitive and the use of race is so limited and flexible that, as SFFA's own expert's analysis showed, Harvard rejects more than two-thirds of Hispanic applicants and slightly less than half of all African-American applicants who are among the top 10% most academically promising applicants. Id., at 191.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,473,"The courts below correctly rejected SFFA's view that Harvard's use of race is unconstitutional because it impacts overall Hispanic and Black student representation by 45%. See Brief for Petitioner 79. That 45% figure shows that eliminating the use of race in admissions would reduce African American representation  from 14% to 6% and Hispanic representation from 14% to 9%. Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 180, 191. Such impact of Harvard's limited use of race on the makeup of the class is less than this Court has previously upheld as narrowly tailored. In Grutter, for example, eliminating the use of race would have reduced the underrepresented minority population by 72%, a much greater effect. 539 U.S. at 320, 123 S.Ct. 2325. And in Fisher II, the use of race helped increase Hispanic representation from 11% to 16.9% (a 54% increase) and African-American representation from 3.5% to 6.8% (a 94% increase). 579 U.S. at 384, 136 S.Ct. 2198.28",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,474,"Finally, the courts below correctly concluded that Harvard complies with this Court's repeated admonition that colleges  and universities cannot define their diversity interest as `some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.' Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 311, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733). Harvard does not specify its diversity objectives in terms of racial quotas, and SFFA did not offer expert testimony to support its racial balancing claim. Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 180, 186-187. Harvard's statistical evidence, by contrast, showed that the admitted classes across racial groups varied considerably year to year, a pattern inconsistent with the imposition of a racial quota or racial balancing. Harvard I, 397 F.Supp.3d at 176-177, see Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 180, 188-189.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,475,"Similarly, Harvard's use of one-pagers containing a snapshot of various demographic characteristics of Harvard's applicant pool during the admissions review process is perfectly consistent with this Court's precedents. Id., at 170-171, 189. Consultation of these reports, with no specific number firmly in mind, does not transform Harvard's program into a quota. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 335-336, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Rather, Harvard's ongoing review complies with the Court's command that universities periodically review the necessity of the use of race in their admissions programs. Id., at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325, Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 388, 136 S.Ct. 2198.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,476,"The Court ignores these careful findings and concludes that Harvard engages in racial balancing because its focus on numbers is obvious. Ante, at 2171. Because SFFA failed to offer an expert and to prove its claim below, the majority is forced to reconstruct the record and conduct its own factual analysis. It thus relies on a single chart from SFFA's brief that truncates relevant data in the record. Compare ibid. (citing Brief for Petitioner in No. 201199, p. 23) with 4 App. in No. 20-1199, p. 1770. That chart cannot displace the careful factfinding by the District Court, which the First Circuit upheld on appeal under clear error review. See Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 180-182, 188-189.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,477,"In any event, the chart is misleading and ignores the broader context of the underlying data that it purports to summarize. Id., at 188. As the First Circuit concluded, what the data actually show is that admissions have increased for all racial minorities, including Asian American students, whose admissions numbers have increased roughly five-fold since 1980 and roughly two-fold since 1990. Id., at 180, 188. The data also show that the racial shares of admitted applicants fluctuate more than the corresponding racial shares of total applicants, which is the opposite of what one would expect if Harvard imposed a quota. Id., at 188. Even looking at the Court's truncated period for the classes of 2009 to 2018, the same pattern holds. Ibid. The fact that Harvard's racial shares of admitted applicants varies relatively little in absolute terms for those classes is unsurprising and reflects the fact that the racial makeup of Harvard's applicant pool also varies very little over this period. Id., at 188-189. Thus, properly understood, the data show that Harvard does not utilize quotas and does not engage in racial balancing. Id., at 189.29  III",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,478,"The Court concludes that Harvard's and UNC's policies are unconstitutional because they serve objectives that are insufficiently measurable, employ racial categories that are imprecise and overbroad, rely on racial stereotypes and disadvantage nonminority groups, and do not have an end point. Ante, at 2165-2173, 2175-2176. In reaching this conclusion, the Court claims those supposed issues with respondents' programs render the programs insufficiently narrow under the strict scrutiny framework that the Court's precedents command.

2022-009,480,"Lost arguments are not grounds to overrule a case. When proponents of those arguments, greater now in number on the Court, return to fight old battles anew, it betrays an unrestrained disregard for precedent. It fosters the People's suspicions that bedrock principles are founded in the proclivities of individuals on this Court, not in the law, and it degrades the integrity of our constitutional system of government. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986). Nowhere is the damage greater than in cases like these that touch upon matters of representation and institutional legitimacy.",Sotomayor,0,

At bottom, the six unelected members of today's majority upend the status quo based on their policy preferences about what race in America should be like, but is not, and their preferences for a veneer of colorblindness in a society where race has always mattered and continues to matter in fact and in law.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,484,"A limited use of race in college admissions is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment and this Court's broader equal protection jurisprudence. The text and history of the Fourteenth Amendment make clear that the Equal Protection Clause permits race-conscious measures. See supra, at 2225-2230. Consistent with that view, the Court has explicitly held that race-based action is sometimes within constitutional constraints. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 237, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995). The Court has thus upheld the use of race in a variety of contexts. See, e.g., Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 737, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 168 L.Ed.2d 508 (2007) (The obligation to disestablish a school system segregated by law can include race-conscious remedies—whether or not a court had issued an order to that effect), Johnson v.

2022-009,485,"Tellingly, in sharp contrast with today's decision, the Court has allowed the use of race when that use burdens minority populations. In United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975), for example, the Court held that it is unconstitutional for border patrol agents to rely on a person's skin color as a single factor to justify a traffic stop based on reasonable suspicion, but it remarked that Mexican appearance could be a relevant factor out of many to justify such a stop at the border and its functional equivalents. Id., at 884-887, 95 S.Ct. 2574, see also id., at 882, 95 S.Ct. 2574 (recognizing that the border includes entire metropolitan areas such as San Diego, El Paso, and the South Texas Rio Grande Valley).31 The Court thus facilitated racial profiling of Latinos as a law enforcement tool and did not adopt a race-blind rule. The Court later extended this reasoning to border patrol agents selectively referring motorists for secondary  inspection at a checkpoint, concluding that even if it be assumed that such referrals are made largely on the basis of apparent Mexican ancestry, there is no constitutional violation. United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 562-563, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976) (footnote omitted).",Sotomayor,0,

2022-009,488,"The majority does not dispute that some uses of race are constitutionally permissible. See ante, at 2161-2162. Indeed, it agrees that a limited use of race is permissible in some college admissions programs. In a footnote, the Court exempts military academies from its ruling in light of the potentially distinct interests they may present. Ante, at 2166, n. 4. To the extent the Court suggests national security interests are distinct, those interests cannot explain the Court's narrow exemption, as national security interests are also implicated at civilian universities. See infra, at 2260-2261, 358 U.S. 54, 79 S.Ct. 99, 3 L.Ed.2d 46. The Court also attempts to justify its carveout based on the fact that no military academy is a party to these cases. Ante, at 2166, n. 4. Yet the same can be said of many other institutions that are not parties here, including the religious universities supporting respondents, which the Court does not similarly exempt from its sweeping opinion. See Brief for Georgetown University et al. as Amici Curiae 18-29 (Georgetown Brief) (Catholic colleges and universities noting that they rely on the use of race in their holistic admissions to further not just their academic goals, but also their religious missions), see also Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 187, n. 24 (Schools that consider race are diverse on numerous dimensions, including in terms of religious affiliation, location, size, and courses of study offered). The Court's carveout only highlights the arbitrariness of its decision and further proves that the Fourteenth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the use of race in college admissions.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,489,"The concurring opinions also agree that the Constitution tolerates some racial classifications. Justice GORSUCH agrees with the majority's conclusion that racial classifications are constitutionally permissible if they advance a compelling interest in a narrowly tailored way. Ante, at 2220. Justice KAVANAUGH, too, agrees that the Constitution permits the use of race if it survives strict scrutiny. Ante, at 2221-2222.32 Justice THOMAS offers an originalist defense of the colorblind Constitution, but his historical analysis leads to the inevitable conclusion that the Constitution is not, in fact, colorblind. Ante, at 2177. Like the majority opinion, Justice THOMAS agrees that race can be used to remedy past discrimination and to equalize treatment against a concrete baseline of government-imposed inequality. Ante,  at 2187. He also argues that race can be used if it satisfies strict scrutiny more broadly, and he considers compelling interests those that prevent anarchy, curb violence, and segregate prisoners. Ante, at 2189-2190. Thus, although Justice THOMAS at times suggests that the Constitution only permits directly remedial measures that benefit identified victims of discrimination, ante, at 2186, he agrees that the Constitution tolerates a much wider range of race-conscious measures.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,490,"In the end, when the Court speaks of a colorblind Constitution, it cannot really mean it, for it is faced with a body of law that recognizes that race-conscious measures are permissible under the Equal Protection Clause. Instead, what the Court actually lands on is an understanding of the Constitution that is colorblind sometimes, when the Court so chooses. Behind those choices lie the Court's own value judgments about what type of interests are sufficiently compelling to justify race-conscious measures.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,491,"Overruling decades of precedent, today's newly constituted Court singles out the limited use of race in holistic college admissions.

2022-009,492,"To avoid public accountability for its choice, the Court seeks cover behind a unique measurability requirement of its own creation. None of this Court's precedents, however, requires that a compelling interest meet some threshold level of precision to be deemed sufficiently compelling.

Thus, although the Members of this majority pay lip service to respondents' commendable  and worthy racial diversity goals, ante, at 2166-2167, they make a clear value judgment today: Racial integration in higher education is not sufficiently important to them. Today, the proclivities of individuals rule. Dobbs, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2443 (dissenting opinion).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,493,"The majority offers no response to any of this. Instead, it attacks a straw man, arguing that the Court's cases recognize that remedying the effects of societal discrimination does not constitute a compelling interest. Ante, at 2172-2174. Yet as the majority acknowledges, while Bakke rejected that interest as insufficiently compelling, it upheld a limited use of race in college admissions to promote the educational benefits that flow from diversity. 438 U.S. at 311-315, 98 S.Ct. 2733. It is that narrower interest, which the Court has reaffirmed numerous times since Bakke and as recently as 2016 in Fisher II, see supra, at 2232-2233, that the Court overrules today.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,495,"The Court's precedents authorizing a limited use of race in college admissions are not just workable—they have been working. Lower courts have consistently applied them without issue, as exemplified by the opinions below and SFFA's and the Court's inability to identify any split of authority. Today, the Court replaces this settled framework with a set of novel restraints that create troubling equal protection problems and share one common purpose: to make it impossible to use race in a holistic way in college admissions, where it is much needed.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,497,"The Court argues that Harvard's and UNC's programs must end because they unfairly disadvantage some racial groups. According to the Court, college admissions are a zero-sum game and respondents' use of race unfairly advantages underrepresented minority students at the expense of other students. Ante, at 2169.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,498,"That is not the role race plays in holistic admissions. Consistent with the Court's precedents, respondents' holistic review policies consider race in a very limited way. Race is only one factor out of many. That type of system allows Harvard and UNC to assemble a diverse class on a multitude of dimensions. Respondents' policies allow them to select students with various unique attributes, including talented athletes, artists, scientists, and musicians. They also allow respondents to assemble a class with diverse viewpoints, including students who have different political ideologies and academic interests, who have struggled with different types of disabilities, who are from various socioeconomic backgrounds, who understand different ways of life in various parts of the country, and—yes—students who self-identify with various racial backgrounds and who can offer different perspectives because of that identity.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,499,"That type of multidimensional system benefits all students. In fact, racial groups that are not underrepresented tend to benefit disproportionately from such a system. Harvard's holistic system, for example, provides points to applicants who qualify as ALDC, meaning athletes, legacy applicants, applicants on the Dean's Interest List primarily relatives of donors, and children of faculty or staff. Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 171 (noting also that SFFA does not challenge the admission of this large group). ALDC applicants are predominantly white: Around 67.8% are white, 11.4% are Asian American, 6% are Black, and 5.6% are Latino. Ibid. By contrast, only 40.3% of non-ALDC applicants are white, 28.3% are Asian American, 11% are  Black, and 12.6% are Latino. Ibid. Although ALDC applicants make up less than 5% of applicants to Harvard, they constitute around 30% of the applicants admitted each year. Ibid. Similarly, because of achievement gaps that result from entrenched racial inequality in K-12 education, see supra, at 2234-2237, a heavy emphasis on grades and standardized test scores disproportionately disadvantages underrepresented racial minorities. Stated simply, race is one small piece of a much larger admissions puzzle where most of the pieces disfavor underrepresented racial minorities. That is precisely why underrepresented racial minorities remain underrepresented. The Court's suggestion that an already advantaged racial group is disadvantaged because of a limited use of race is a myth.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,500,"The majority's true objection appears to be that a limited use of race in college admissions does, in fact, achieve what it is designed to achieve: It helps equalize opportunity and advances respondents' objectives by increasing the number of underrepresented racial minorities on college campuses, particularly Black and Latino students. This is unacceptable, the Court says, because racial groups that are not underrepresented would be admitted in greater numbers without these policies. Ante, at 2169. Reduced to its simplest terms, the Court's conclusion is that an increase in the representation of racial minorities at institutions of higher learning that were historically reserved for white Americans is an unfair and repugnant out-come that offends the Equal Protection Clause. It provides a license to discriminate against white Americans, the Court says, which requires the courts and state actors to pick the right races to benefit. Ante, at 2175.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,501,"Nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment or its history supports the Court's shocking proposition, which echoes arguments made by opponents of Reconstruction-era laws and this Court's decision in Brown. Supra, at 2225-2234. In a society where opportunity is dispensed along racial lines, racial equality cannot be achieved without making room for underrepresented groups that for far too long were denied admission through the force of law, including at Harvard and UNC. Quite the opposite: A racially integrated vision of society, in which institutions reflect all sectors of the American public and where the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners are able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood, is precisely what the Equal Protection Clause commands. Martin Luther King I Have a Dream Speech (Aug. 28, 1963). It is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 332, 123 S.Ct. 2325.34  By singling out race, the Court imposes a special burden on racial minorities for whom race is a crucial component of their identity. Holistic admissions require truly individualized consideration of the whole person. Id., at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Yet, by foreclosing racial considerations, colorblindness denies those who racially self-identify the full expression of their identity and treats racial identity as inferior among all other forms of social identity. E. Boddie, The Indignities of Colorblindness, 64 UCLA L. Rev. Discourse, 64, 67 (2016). The Court's approach thus turns the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee on its head and creates an equal protection problem of its own.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,502,"There is no question that minority students will bear the burden of today's decision. Students of color testified at trial that racial self-identification was an important component of their application because without it they would not be able to present a full version of themselves. For example, Rimel Mwamba, a Black UNC alumna, testified that it was really important that UNC see who she is holistically and how the color of her skin and the texture of her hair impacted her upbringing. 2 App. in No. 21-707, p. 1033. Itzel Vasquez-Rodriguez, who identifies as Mexican-American of Cora descent, testified that her ethnoracial identity is a core piece of who she is and has impacted every experience she has had, such that she could not explain her potential contributions to Harvard without any reference to it. 2 App. in No. 20-1199, at 906, 908. Sally Chen, a Harvard alumna who identifies as Chinese American, explained that being the child of Chinese immigrants was really fundamental to explaining who she is. Id., at 968-969. Thang Diep, a Harvard alumnus, testified that his Vietnamese identity was such a big part of himself that he needed to discuss it in his application. Id., at 949. And Sarah Cole, a Black Harvard alumna, emphasized that to try to not see her race is to try to not see her simply because there is no part of her experience, no part of her journey, no part of her life that has been untouched by her race. Id., at 932.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,503,"In a single paragraph at the end of its lengthy opinion, the Court suggests that nothing in today's opinion prohibits universities from considering a student's essay that explains how race affected that student's life. Ante, at 2176. This supposed recognition that universities can, in some situations, consider race in application essays is nothing but an attempt to put lipstick on a pig. The Court's opinion circumscribes universities' ability to consider race in any form by meticulously gutting respondents' asserted diversity interests. See supra, at 2247-2249. Yet, because the Court cannot escape the inevitable truth that race matters in students' lives, it announces a false promise to save face and appear attuned to reality. No one is fooled.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,504,"Further, the Court's demand that a student's discussion of racial self-identification be tied to individual qualities, such as courage, leadership, unique ability, and determination, only serves to perpetuate the false narrative that Harvard and UNC currently provide preferences on the basis of race alone. Ante, at 2170, 2175-2176, see also ante, at 2169, n. 6 (claiming without support that race alone explains the admissions decisions for hundreds if not thousands of applicants). The Court's precedents already require that universities take race into account holistically, in a limited way, and based on the type of individualized and flexible assessment that the Court purports to favor. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325, see Brief for Students and Alumni of Harvard College as Amici Curiae 15-17 (Harvard College Brief) (describing how  the dozens of application files in the record uniformly show that, in line with Harvard's `whole-person' admissions philosophy, Harvard's admissions officers engage in a highly nuanced assessment of each applicant's background and qualifications). After extensive discovery and two lengthy trials, neither SFFA nor the majority can point to a single example of an underrepresented racial minority who was admitted to Harvard or UNC on the basis of race alone.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,505,"In the end, the Court merely imposes its preferred college application format on the Nation, not acting as a court of law applying precedent but taking on the role of college administrators to decide what is better for society. The Court's course reflects its inability to recognize that racial identity informs some students' viewpoints and experiences in unique ways. The Court goes as far as to claim that Bakke's recognition that Black Americans can offer different perspectives than white people amounts to a stereotype. Ante, at 2169-2170.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,506,"It is not a stereotype to acknowledge the basic truth that young people's experiences are shaded by a societal structure where race matters. Acknowledging that there is something special about a student of color who graduates valedictorian from a predominantly white school is not a stereotype. Nor is it a stereotype to acknowledge that race imposes certain burdens on students of color that it does not impose on white students. For generations, black and brown parents have given their children `the talk'—instructing them never to run down the street, always keep your hands where they can be seen, do not even think of talking back to a stranger—all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react to them. Utah v. Strieff, 579 U.S. 232, 254, 136 S.Ct. 2056, 195 L.Ed.2d 400 (2016) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). Those conversations occur regardless of socioeconomic background or any other aspect of a student's self-identification. They occur because of race. As Andrew Brennen, a UNC alumnus, testified, running down the neighborhood  people don't see him as someone that is relatively affluent, they see him as a black man. 2 App. in No. 21-707, at 951-952.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,507,"The absence of racial diversity, by contrast, actually contributes to stereotyping. Diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of respondents' mission, and one that they cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325. When there is an increase in underrepresented minority students on campus, racial stereotypes lose their force because diversity allows students to learn there is no `minority viewpoint' but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students. Id., at 319-320, 123 S.Ct. 2325. By preventing respondents from achieving their diversity objectives, it is the Court's opinion that facilitates stereotyping on American college campuses.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,508,"To be clear, today's decision leaves intact holistic college admissions and recruitment efforts that seek to enroll diverse classes without using racial classifications. Universities should continue to use those tools as best they can to recruit and admit students from different backgrounds based on all the other factors the Court's opinion does not, and cannot, touch. Colleges and universities can continue to consider socioeconomic diversity and to recruit and enroll students who are first-generation college applicants or who speak multiple languages, for example. Those factors are not interchangeable with race. UNC, 567 F.Supp.3d at 643, see, e.g., 2 App. in No. 21-707, at 975-976 (Laura Ornelas, a UNC alumna, testifying that her Latina identity, socioeconomic status,  and first-generation college status are all important but different parts to getting a full picture of who she is and how she sees the world). At SFFA's own urging, those efforts remain constitutionally permissible. See Brief for Petitioner 81-86 (emphasizing race-neutral alternatives that Harvard and UNC should implement, such as those that focus on socioeconomic and geographic diversity, percentage plans, plans that increase community college transfers, and plans that develop partnerships with disadvantaged high schools), see also ante, at 2203-2204, 2204, 2205-2206 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (arguing universities can consider race-neutral policies similar to those adopted in States such as California and Michigan, and that universities can consider status as a first-generation college applicant, financial means, and generational inheritance or otherwise), ante, at 2225 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring) (citing SFFA's briefs and concluding that universities can use race-neutral means), ante, at 2215, n. 4 (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (recounting what SFFA has argued every step of the way as to race-neutral tools).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,509,"The Court today also does not adopt SFFA's suggestion that college admissions should be a function of academic metrics alone. Using class rank or standardized test scores as the only admissions criteria would severely undermine multidimensional diversity in higher education. Such a system would exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training. It would exclude a talented young biologist who struggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities classes. And it would exclude a student whose freshman-year grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three years of school, only to find herself just outside of the top decile of her class. Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 386, 136 S.Ct. 2198. A myopic focus on academic ratings does not lead to a diverse student body. Ibid.35",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,511,"As noted above, this Court suggests that the use of race in college admissions is unworkable because respondents' objectives are not sufficiently measurable, focused, concrete, and coherent. Ante, at 2166-2167, 2168, 2175-2176. How much more precision is required or how universities are supposed to meet the Court's measurability requirement, the Court's opinion does not say. That is exactly the point. The Court is not interested in crafting a workable framework that promotes racial diversity on college campuses. Instead, it announces a requirement designed to ensure all race-conscious plans fail. Any increased level of precision runs the risk of violating the Court's admonition that colleges and universities operate their race-conscious admissions policies with no `specified percentages' and no specific numbers firmly in mind. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 324, 335, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Thus, the majority's holding puts schools in an untenable position. It creates a legal framework where race-conscious plans must be measured with precision but also must not be measured with precision. That holding is not meant to infuse clarity into the strict scrutiny framework, it is designed to render  strict scrutiny `fatal in fact.' Id., at 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc., 515 U.S. at 237, 115 S.Ct. 2097). Indeed, the Court gives the game away when it holds that, to the extent respondents are actually measuring their diversity objectives with any level of specificity (for example, with a focus on numbers or specific numerical commitment), their plans are unconstitutional. Ante, at 2171, see also ante, at 2191 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (I highly doubt any university will be able to show a measurable state interest).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,513,"The Court also holds that Harvard's and UNC's race-conscious programs are unconstitutional because they rely on racial categories that are imprecise, opaque, and arbitrary. Ante, at 2167-2168. To start, the racial categories that the Court finds troubling resemble those used across the Federal Government for data collection, compliance reporting, and program administration purposes, including, for example, by the U. S. Census Bureau. See, e.g., 62 Fed. Reg. 58786-58790 (1997). Surely, not all `federal grant-in-aid benefits, drafting of legislation, urban and regional planning, business planning, and academic and social studies' that flow from census data collection, Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2551, 2561, 204 L.Ed.2d 978 (2019), are constitutionally suspect.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,514,"The majority presumes that it knows better and appoints itself as an expert on data collection methods, calling for a higher level of granularity to fix a supposed problem of overinclusiveness and underinclusiveness. Yet it does not identify a single instance where respondents' methodology has prevented any student from reporting their race with the level of detail they preferred. The record shows that it is up to students to choose whether to identify as one, multiple, or none of these categories. See Harvard I, 397 F.Supp.3d at 137, UNC, 567 F.Supp.3d at 596. To the extent students need to convey additional information, students can select subcategories or provide more detail in their personal statements or essays. See Harvard I, 397 F.Supp.3d at 137. Students often do so. See, e.g., 2 App. in No. 20-1199, at 906-907 (student respondent discussing her Latina identity on her application), id., at 949 (student respondent testifying he wrote about his Vietnamese identity on his application). Notwithstanding this Court's confusion about racial self-identification, neither students nor universities are confused. There is no evidence that the racial categories that respondents use are unworkable.36",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,516,"Cherry-picking language from Grutter, the Court also holds that Harvard's and UNC's race-conscious programs are unconstitutional because they do not have a specific expiration date. Ante, at 2170-2173. This new durational requirement is also not grounded in law, facts, or common  sense. Grutter simply announced a general expectation that the use of racial preferences would no longer be necessary in the future. 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325. As even SFFA acknowledges, those remarks were nothing but aspirational statements by the Grutter Court. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21707, p. 56.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,517,"Yet this Court suggests that everyone, including the Court itself, has been misreading Grutter for 20 years. Grutter, according to the majority, requires that universities identify a specific end point for the use of race. Ante, at 2172. Justice KAVANAUGH, for his part, suggests that Grutter itself automatically expires in 25 years, after either the college class of 2028 or the college class of 2032. Ante, at 2224, n. 1. A faithful reading of this Court's precedents reveals that Grutter held nothing of the sort.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,518,"True, Grutter referred to 25 years, but that arbitrary number simply reflected the time that had elapsed since the Court first approved the use of race in college admissions in Bakke. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325. It is also true that Grutter remarked that race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time, but it did not do so in a vaccum, as the Court suggests. Id., at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Rather than impose a fixed expiration date, the Court tasked universities with the responsibility of periodically assessing whether their race-conscious programs are still necessary. Ibid. Grutter offered as examples sunset provisions, periodic reviews, and experimenting with race-neutral alternatives as they develop. Ibid. That is precisely how this Court has previously interpreted Grutter's command. See Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 388, 136 S.Ct. 2198 (It is the University's ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,519,"Grutter's requirement that universities engage in periodic reviews so the use of race can end as soon as practicable is well grounded in the need to ensure that race is employed no more broadly than the interest demands. 539 U.S. at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325. That is, it is grounded in strict scrutiny. By contrast, the Court's holding is based on the fiction that racial inequality has a predictable cutoff date. Equality is an ongoing project in a society where racial inequality persists. See supra, at 2234-2239. A temporal requirement that rests on the fantasy that racial inequality will end at a predictable hour is illogical and unworkable. There is a sound reason why this Court's precedents have never imposed the majority's strict deadline: Institutions cannot predict the future. Speculating about a day when consideration of race will become unnecessary is arbitrary at best and frivolous at worst. There is no constitutional duty to engage in that type of shallow guesswork.37",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,520,"Harvard and UNC engage in the ongoing review that the Court's precedents demand. They use their data to scrutinize  the fairness of their admissions programs, to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a race-conscious policy, and to identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the affirmative-action measures they deem necessary. Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 388, 136 S.Ct. 2198. The Court holds, however, that respondents' attention to numbers amounts to unconstitutional racial balancing. Ante, at 2170-2172. But `some attention to numbers' is both necessary and permissible. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. 2733). Universities cannot blindly operate their limited race-conscious programs without regard for any quantitative information. Increasing minority enrollment is instrumental to the educational benefits that respondents seek to achieve, Fisher II, 579 U.S. at 381, 136 S.Ct. 2198, and statistics, data, and numbers have some value as a gauge of respondents' ability to enroll students who can offer underrepresented perspectives.

2022-009,523,"He first renews his argument that the use of race in holistic admissions leads to the inevitable underperformance by Black and Latino students at elite universities because they are less academically prepared than the white and Asian students with whom they must compete. Fisher I, 570 U.S. at 332, 133 S.Ct. 2411 (concurring opinion). Justice THOMAS speaks only for himself. The Court previously declined to adopt this so-called mismatch hypothesis for good reason: It was debunked long ago. The decades-old studies advanced by the handful of authors upon whom Justice THOMAS relies, ante, at 2197-2198, have major methodological flaws, are based on unreliable data, and do not meet the basic tenets of rigorous social science research. Brief for Empirical Scholars as Amici Curiae 3, 9-25. By contrast, many social scientists have studied the impact of elite educational institutions on student outcomes, and have found, among other things, that attending a more selective school is associated with higher graduation rates and higher earnings for underrepresented minority students —conclusions directly contrary to mismatch. Id., at 7-9 (collecting studies). This extensive body of research is supported by the most obvious data point available to this institution today: The three Justices of color on this Court graduated from elite universities and law schools with race-conscious admissions programs, and achieved successful legal careers, despite having different educational backgrounds than their peers. A discredited hypothesis that the Court previously rejected is no reason to overrule precedent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,524,"Justice THOMAS claims that the weight of this evidence is overcome by a single more recent article published in 2016. Ante, at 2198, n. 8. That article, however, explains that studies supporting the mismatch hypothesis yield misleading conclusions, overstate the amount of mismatch, preclude one from drawing any concrete conclusions, and rely on methodologically flawed assumptions that lead to an upwardly-biased estimate of mismatch. P. Arcidiacono & M. Lovenheim, Affirmative Action and the Quality-Fit Trade-off, 54 J. Econ. Lit. 3, 17, 20 (2016), see id., at 6 (economists should be very  skeptical of the mismatch hypothesis).

Studies disprove this sentiment, which echoes tropes of stigma that were employed to oppose Reconstruction policies. A. Onwuachi-Willig, E. Houh, & M. Campbell, Cracking the Egg: Which Came First—Stigma or Affirmative Action? 96 Cal. L. Rev. 1299, 1323 (2008), see, e.g., id., at 1343-1344 (study of seven law schools showing that stigma results from racial stereotypes that have attached historically to different groups, regardless of affirmative action's existence). Indeed, equating state-sponsored segregation with race-conscious admissions policies that promote racial integration trivializes the harms of segregation and offends Brown's transformative legacy. School segregation has a detrimental effect on Black students by denoting the inferiority of their status in the community and by `depriving them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system.' 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. 686. In sharp contrast, race-conscious college admissions ensure that higher education is visibly open to and inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 332, 123 S.Ct. 2325. These two uses of race are not created equal. They are not equally objectionable. Id., at 327, 123 S.Ct. 2325.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,526,"Relatedly, Justice THOMAS suggests that race-conscious college admissions policies harm racial minorities by increasing affinity-based activities on college campuses. Ante, at 2201. Not only is there no evidence of a causal connection between the use of race in college admissions and the supposed rise of those activities, but Justice THOMAS points to no evidence that affinity groups cause any harm. Affinity-based activities actually help racial minorities improve their visibility on college campuses and decrease racial stigma and vulnerability to stereotypes caused by conditions of racial isolation and tokenization. U. Jayakumar, Why Are All Black Students Still Sitting Together in the Proverbial College Cafeteria?, Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA (Oct. 2015), see also Brief for Respondent-Students in No. 21707, p. 42 (collecting student testimony demonstrating that affinity groups beget important academic and social benefits for racial minorities), 4 App. in No. 20-1199, at 1591 (Harvard Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion Report) (noting that concerns that culturally specific spaces or affinity-themed housing will isolate student minorities are misguided because those spaces allow students to come together  to deal with intellectual, emotional, and social challenges).",Sotomayor,0,

It is true that SFFA alleged that Harvard discriminates against Asian American students. Ante, at 2199. Specifically, SFFA argued that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants vis-à-vis white applicants through the use of the personal rating, an allegedly highly subjective component of the admissions process that is susceptible to stereotyping and bias. Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 196, see Brief for  Professors of Economics as Amici Curiae 24. It is also true, however, that there was a lengthy trial to test those allegations, which SFFA lost. Justice THOMAS points to no legal or factual error below, precisely because there is none.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,528,"To begin, this part of SFFA's discrimination claim does not even fall under the strict scrutiny framework in Grutter and its progeny, which concerns the use of racial classifications. The personal rating is a facially race-neutral component of Harvard's admissions policy.38 Therefore, even assuming for the sake of argument that Harvard engages in racial discrimination through the personal rating, there is no connection between that rating and the remedy that SFFA sought and that the majority grants today: ending the limited use of race in the entire admissions process. In any event, after assessing the credibility of fact witnesses and considering extensive documentary evidence and expert testimony, the courts below found no discrimination against Asian Americans. Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 195, n. 34, 202, see id., at 195-204.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-009,529,"There is no question that the Asian American community continues to struggle against potent and dehumanizing stereotypes in our society. It is precisely because racial discrimination persists in our society, however, that the use of race in college admissions to achieve racially diverse classes is critical to improving cross-racial understanding and breaking down racial stereotypes. See supra, at 2233-2234. Indeed, the record shows that some Asian American applicants are actually advantaged by Harvard's use of race, Harvard II, 980 F.3d at 191, and eliminating consideration of race would significantly disadvantage at least some Asian American applicants, Harvard I, 397 F.Supp.3d at 194. Race-conscious holistic admissions that contextualize the racial identity of each individual allow Asian American applicants who would be less likely to be admitted without a comprehensive understanding of their background to explain the value of their unique background, heritage, and perspective. Id., at 195. Because the Asian American community is not a monolith, race-conscious holistic admissions allow colleges and universities to consider the vast differences within that community.

2022-009,562,"Three hundred and fifty years ago, the Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into slavery. Uprooted from his homeland and thrust into bondage for forced labor, the slave was deprived of all legal rights. It was unlawful to teach him to read, he could be sold away from his family and friends at the whim of his master, and killing or maiming him was not a crime. The system of slavery brutalized and dehumanized both master and slave. Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 387-388, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978).",Jackson,0,
2022-009,563,"Slavery should have been (and was to many) self-evidently dissonant with our avowed founding principles. When the time came to resolve that dissonance, eleven States chose slavery. With the Union's survival at stake, Frederick Douglass noted, Black Americans in the South were almost the only reliable friends the nation had, and but for their help  the Rebels might have succeeded in breaking up the Union.2 After the war, Senator John Sherman defended the proposed Fourteenth  Amendment in a manner that encapsulated our Reconstruction Framers' highest sentiments: We are bound by every obligation, by Black Americans' service on the battlefield, by their heroes who are buried in our cause, by their patriotism in the hours that tried our country, we are bound to protect them and all their natural rights.3",Jackson,0,

So, when the Reconstruction Congress passed a bill to secure all citizens the same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens, 14 Stat. 27, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it because it discriminated in favor of the negro.5",Jackson,0,
2022-009,565,"That attitude, and the Nation's associated retreat from Reconstruction, made prophesy out of Congressman Thaddeus Stevens's fear that those States will all keep up this discrimination, and crush to death the hated freedmen.6 And this Court facilitated that retrenchment.7 Not just in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), but in almost every instance, the Court chose to restrict the scope of the second founding.8 Thus, thirteen years pre-Plessy, in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883), our predecessors on this Court invalidated Congress's attempt to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments via the Civil Rights Act of 1875, lecturing that there must be some stage when Black Americans take the rank of a mere citizen, and cease to be the special favorite of the laws. Id., at 25, 3 S.Ct.18. But Justice Harlan knew better. He responded: What the nation, through Congress, has sought to accomplish in reference to Black people is—what had already been done in every State of the Union for the white race—to secure and protect rights belonging to them as freemen and citizens, nothing more. Id., at 61, 3 S.Ct. 18 (dissenting opinion).",Jackson,0,
2022-009,566,"Justice Harlan dissented alone. And the betrayal that this Court enabled had concrete effects. Enslaved Black people had built great wealth, but only for enslavers.9 No surprise, then, that freedmen leapt at the chance to control their own labor and to build their own financial security.10 Still, White southerners often simply refused to sell land to blacks, even when not  selling was economically foolish.11 To bolster private exclusion, States sometimes passed laws forbidding such sales.12 The inability to build wealth through that most American of means forced Black people into sharecropping roles, where they somehow always tended to find themselves in debt to the landowner when the growing season closed, with no hope of recourse against the ever-present cooking of the books.13",Jackson,0,
2022-009,567,"Sharecropping is but one example of race-linked obstacles that the law (and private parties) laid down to hinder the progress and prosperity of Black people. Vagrancy laws criminalized free Black men who failed to work for White landlords.14 Many States barred freedmen from hunting or fishing to ensure that they could not live without entering de facto reenslavement as sharecroppers.15 A cornucopia of laws (e.g., banning hitchhiking, prohibiting encouraging a laborer to leave his employer, and penalizing those who prompted Black southerners to migrate northward) ensured that Black people could not freely seek better lives elsewhere.16 And when statutes did not ensure compliance, state-sanctioned (and private) violence did.17",Jackson,0,
2022-009,568,"Thus emerged Jim Crow—a system that was, as much as anything else, a comprehensive scheme of economic exploitation to replace the Black Codes, which themselves had replaced slavery's form of comprehensive economic exploitation.18 Meanwhile, as Jim Crow ossified, the Federal Government was giving away land on the western frontier, and with it the opportunity for upward mobility and a more secure future, over the 1862 Homestead Act's three-quarter-century tenure.19 Black people were exceedingly unlikely to be allowed to share in those benefits, which by one calculation may have advantaged approximately 46 million Americans living today.20",Jackson,0,
2022-009,569,"Despite these barriers, Black people persisted. Their so-called Great Migration northward accelerated during and after the First World War.21 Like clockwork, American cities responded with racially exclusionary zoning (and similar policies).22 As a result, Black migrants had to pay disproportionately high prices for disproportionately subpar housing.23 Nor did migration  make it more likely for Black people to access home ownership, as banks would not lend to Black people, and in the rare cases banks would fund home loans, exorbitant interest rates were charged.24 With Black people still locked out of the Homestead Act giveaway, it is no surprise that, when the Great Depression arrived, race-based wealth, health, and opportunity gaps were the norm.25",Jackson,0,
2022-009,570,"Federal and State Governments' selective intervention further exacerbated the disparities. Consider, for example, the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), created in 1933.26 HOLC purchased mortgages threatened with foreclosure and issued new, amortized mortgages in their place.27 Not only did this mean that recipients of these mortgages could gain equity while paying off the loan, successful full payment would make the recipient a homeowner.28 Ostensibly to identify (and avoid) the riskiest recipients, the HOLC created color-coded maps of every metropolitan area in the nation.29 Green meant safe, red meant risky. And, regardless of class, every neighborhood with Black people earned the red designation.30",Jackson,0,
2022-009,571,"Similarly, consider the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), created in 1934, which insured highly desirable bank mortgages. Eligibility for this insurance required an FHA appraisal of the property to ensure a low default risk.31 But, nationwide, it was FHA's established policy to provide no guarantees for mortgages to African Americans, or to whites who might lease to African Americans, irrespective of creditworthiness.32 No surprise, then, that between 1934 and 1968, 98 percent of FHA loans went to white Americans, with whole cities (ones that had a disproportionately large number of Black people due to housing segregation) sometimes being deemed ineligible for FHA intervention on racial grounds.33 The Veterans Administration operated similarly.34",Jackson,0,
2022-009,572,"One more example: the Federal Home Loan Bank Board chartered, insured, and regulated savings and loan associations from the early years of the New Deal.35 But it did not oppose the denial of mortgages to African Americans until 1961 (and even then opposed discrimination ineffectively).36",Jackson,0,
2022-009,573,"The upshot of all this is that, due to government policy choices, in the suburban-shaping years between 1930 and 1960, fewer than one percent of all mortgages in the nation were issued to African Americans.37 Thus, based on their race, Black people were locked out of the greatest  mass-based opportunity for wealth accumulation in American history.38",Jackson,0,
2022-009,574,"For present purposes, it is significant that, in so excluding Black people, government policies affirmatively operated—one could say, affirmatively acted—to dole out preferences to those who, if nothing else, were not Black. Those past preferences carried forward and are reinforced today by (among other things) the benefits that flow to homeowners and to the holders of other forms of capital that are hard to obtain unless one already has assets.39",Jackson,0,
2022-009,575,"This discussion of how the existing gaps were formed is merely illustrative, not exhaustive. I will pass over Congress's repeated crafting of family-, worker-, and retiree-protective legislation to channel benefits to White people, thereby excluding Black Americans from what was otherwise a revolution in the status of most working Americans.40 I will also skip how the G.

Bill's creation of  middle-class America (by giving $95 billion to veterans and their families between 1944 and 1971) was deliberately designed to accommodate Jim Crow.41 So, too, will I bypass how Black people were prevented from partaking in the consumer credit market—a market that helped White people who could access it build and protect wealth.42 Nor will time and space permit my elaborating how local officials' racial hostility meant that even those benefits that Black people could formally obtain were unequally distributed along racial lines.43 And I could not possibly discuss every way in which, in light of this history, facially race-blind policies still work race-based harms today (e.g., racially disparate tax-system treatment, the disproportionate location of toxic-waste facilities in Black communities, or the deliberate action of governments at all levels in designing interstate highways to bisect and segregate Black urban communities).44",Jackson,0,
2022-009,576,"The point is this: Given our history, the origin of persistent race-linked gaps should be no mystery. It has never been a deficiency of Black Americans' desire or ability to, in Frederick Douglass's words, stand on their own legs.45 Rather, it was always simply what Justice Harlan recognized 140 years ago—the persistent and pernicious denial of what had already been done in every State of the Union for the white race. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. at 61, 3 S.Ct. 18 (dissenting opinion).",Jackson,0,
2022-009,578,"History speaks. In some form, it can be heard forever. The race-based gaps that first developed centuries ago are echoes from the past that still exist today. By all accounts, they are still stark.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,579,"Start with wealth and income. Just four years ago, in 2019, Black families' median  wealth was approximately $24,000.46 For White families, that number was approximately eight times as much (about $188,000).47 These wealth disparities exist at every income and education level, so, on average, white families with college degrees have over $300,000 more wealth than black families with college degrees.48 This disparity has also accelerated over time—from a roughly $40,000 gap between White and Black household median net worth in 1993 to a roughly $135,000 gap in 2019.49 Median income numbers from 2019 tell the same story: $76,057 for White households, $98,174 for Asian households, $56,113 for Latino households, and $45,438 for Black households.50",Jackson,0,
2022-009,580,"These financial gaps are unsurprising in light of the link between home ownership and wealth. Today, as was true 50 years ago, Black home ownership trails White home ownership by approximately 25 percentage points.51 Moreover, Black Americans' homes (relative to White Americans') constitute a greater percentage of household wealth, yet tend to be worth less, are subject to higher effective property taxes, and generally lost more value in the Great Recession.52",Jackson,0,
2022-009,581,"From those markers of social and financial unwellness flow others. In most state flagship higher educational institutions, the percentage of Black undergraduates is lower than the percentage of Black high school graduates in that State.53 Black Americans in their late twenties are about half as likely as their White counterparts to have college degrees.54 And because lower family income and wealth force students to borrow more, those Black students who do graduate college find themselves four years out with about $50,000 in student debt—nearly twice as much as their White compatriots.55",Jackson,0,
2022-009,582,"As for postsecondary professional arenas, despite being about 13% of the population, Black people make up only about 5% of lawyers.56 Such disparity also appears in the business realm: Of the roughly 1,800 chief executive officers to have appeared on the well-known Fortune 500 list, fewer than 25 have been Black (as of  2022, only six are Black).57 Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged, Blackowned small businesses failed at dramatically higher rates than White-owned small businesses, partly due to the disproportionate denial of the forgivable loans needed to survive the economic downturn.58",Jackson,0,
2022-009,583,"Health gaps track financial ones. When tested, Black children have blood lead levels that are twice the rate of White children —irreversible contamination working irremediable harm on developing brains.59 Black (and Latino) children with heart conditions are more likely to die than their White counterparts.60 Race-linked mortality-rate disparity has also persisted, and is highest among infants.61",Jackson,0,
2022-009,584,"So, too, for adults: Black men are twice as likely to die from prostate cancer as White men and have lower 5-year cancer survival rates.62 Uterine cancer has spiked in recent years among all women—but has spiked highest for Black women, who die of uterine cancer at nearly twice the rate of any other racial or ethnic group.63 Black mothers are up to four times more likely than White mothers to die as a result of childbirth.64 And COVID killed Black Americans at higher rates than White Americans.65",Jackson,0,
2022-009,585,"Across the board, Black Americans experience the highest rates of obesity, hypertension, maternal mortality, infant mortality, stroke, and asthma.66 These and other disparities—the predictable result of opportunity disparities—lead to at least 50,000 excess deaths a year for Black Americans vis-à-vis White Americans.67 That is 80 million excess years of life lost from just 1999 through 2020.68",Jackson,0,
2022-009,586,"Amici tell us that race-linked health inequities pervade nearly every index of human health resulting in an overall reduced life expectancy for racial and ethnic minorities that cannot be explained by genetics.69 Meanwhile—tying health and wealth together—while she lays dying, the typical Black American pays more for medical care and incurs more medical debt.70",Jackson,0,
2022-009,588,"We return to John and James now, with history in hand. It is hardly John's fault that he is the seventh generation to graduate from UNC. UNC should permit him to honor that legacy. Neither, however, was it James's (or his family's) fault that he would be the first. And UNC ought to be able to consider why.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,589,"Most likely, seven generations ago, when John's family was building its knowledge base and wealth potential on the university's campus, James's family was enslaved and laboring in North Carolina's fields. Six generations ago, the North Carolina Redeemers aimed to nullify the results of the Civil War through terror and violence, marauding in hopes of excluding all who looked like James from equal citizenship.71 Five generations ago, the North Carolina Red Shirts finished the job.72 Four (and three) generations ago, Jim Crow was so entrenched in the State of North Carolina that UNC enforced its own Jim Crow regulations.73 Two generations ago, North Carolina's Governor still railed against `integration for integration's sake'—and UNC Black enrollment was minuscule.74 So, at bare minimum, one generation ago, James's family was six generations behind because of their race, making John's six generations ahead.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,590,These stories are not every student's story. But they are many students' stories. To demand that colleges ignore race in today's admissions practices—and thus disregard the fact that racial disparities may have mattered for where some applicants find themselves today—is not only an affront to the dignity of those students for whom race matters.75 It also condemns our society to never escape the past that explains how and why race matters to the very concept of who merits admission.,Jackson,0,
2022-009,591,"Permitting (not requiring) colleges like UNC to assess merit fully, without blinders on, plainly advances (not thwarts) the Fourteenth Amendment's core promise. UNC considers race as one of many factors in order to best assess the entire unique import of John's and James's individual lives and inheritances on an equal basis. Doing so involves acknowledging (not ignoring) the seven generations' worth of historical privileges and disadvantages that each of these applicants was born with when his own life's journey started a mere 18 years ago.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,593,"Recognizing all this, UNC has developed a holistic review process to evaluate applicants for admission. Students must submit standardized test scores and other conventional information.76 But applicants are not-required to submit demographic information like gender and race.77 UNC considers whatever information each applicant submits using a nonexhaustive list of 40 criteria grouped into eight categories: academic performance, academic program, standardized testing, extracurricular activity, special talent, essay criteria, background, and personal criteria.78",Jackson,0,
2022-009,594,"Drawing on those 40 criteria, a UNC staff member evaluating John and James would consider, with respect to each, his engagement outside the classroom, persistence of commitment, demonstrated capacity  for leadership, contributions to family, school, and community, work history, and his unique or unusual interests.79 Relevant, too, would be his relative advantage or disadvantage, as indicated by family income level, education history of family members, impact of parents/guardians in the home, or formal education environment, experience of growing up in rural or center-city locations, and his status as child or step-child of Carolina alumni.80 The list goes on. The process is holistic, through and through.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,595,"So where does race come in? According to UNC's admissions-policy document, reviewers may also consider the race or ethnicity of any student (if that information is provided) in light of UNC's interest in diversity.81 And, yes, the race or ethnicity of any student may—or may not— receive a `plus' in the evaluation process depending on the individual circumstances revealed in the student's application.82 Stephen Farmer, the head of UNC's Office of Undergraduate Admissions, confirmed at trial (under oath) that UNC's admissions process operates in this fashion.83",Jackson,0,
2022-009,596,"Thus, to be crystal clear: Every student who chooses to disclose his or her race is eligible for such a race-linked plus, just as any student who chooses to disclose his or her unusual interests can be credited for what those interests might add to UNC. The record supports no intimation to the contrary. Eligibility is just that, a plus is never automatically awarded, never considered in numerical terms, and never automatically results in an offer of admission.84 There are no race-based quotas in UNC's holistic review process.85 In fact, during the admissions cycle, the school prevents anyone who knows the overall racial makeup of the admitted-student pool from reading any applications.86",Jackson,0,
2022-009,597,"More than that, every applicant is also eligible for a diversity-linked plus (beyond race) more generally.87 And, notably, UNC understands diversity broadly, including socioeconomic status, first-generation college status  political beliefs, religious beliefs  diversity of thoughts, experiences, ideas, and talents.88",Jackson,0,
2022-009,598,"A plus, by its nature, can certainly matter to an admissions case. But make no mistake: When an applicant chooses to disclose his or her race, UNC treats that aspect of identity on par with other aspects of applicants' identity that affect who they are (just like, say, where one grew up, or medical challenges one has faced).89  And race is considered alongside any other factor that sheds light on what attributes applicants will bring to the campus and whether they are likely to excel once there.90 A reader of today's majority opinion could be forgiven for misunderstanding how UNC's program really works, or for missing that, under UNC's holistic review process, a White student could receive a diversity plus while a Black student might not.91",Jackson,0,
2022-009,599,"UNC does not do all this to provide handouts to either John or James. It does this to ascertain who among its tens of thousands of applicants has the capacity to take full advantage of the opportunity to attend, and contribute to, this prestigious institution, and thus merits admission.92 And UNC has concluded that ferreting this out requires understanding the full person, which means taking seriously not just SAT scores or whether the applicant plays the trumpet, but also any way in which the applicant's race-linked experience bears on his capacity and merit. In this way, UNC is able to value what it means for James, whose ancestors received no race-based advantages, to make himself competitive for admission to a flagship school nevertheless. Moreover, recognizing this aspect of James's story does not preclude UNC from valuing John's legacy or any obstacles that his story reflects.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,600,"So, to repeat: UNC's program permits, but does not require, admissions officers to value both John's and James's love for their State, their high schools' rigor, and whether either has overcome obstacles that are indicative of their persistence of commitment.93 It permits, but does not require, them to value John's identity as a child of UNC alumni (or, perhaps, if things had turned out differently, as a first-generation White student from Appalachia whose family struggled to make ends meet during the Great Recession). And it permits, but does not require, them to value James's race—not in the abstract, but as an element of who he is, no less than his love for his State, his high school courses, and the obstacles he has overcome.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,601,"Understood properly, then, what SFFA caricatures as an unfair race-based preference cashes out, in a holistic system, to a personalized assessment of the advantages and disadvantages that every applicant might have received by accident of birth  plus all that has happened to them since. It ensures a full accounting of everything that bears on the individual's resilience and likelihood of enhancing the UNC campus. It also forecasts his potential for entering the wider world upon graduation and making a meaningful contribution to the larger, collective, societal goal that the Equal Protection Clause embodies (its guarantee that the United States of America offers genuinely equal treatment to every person, regardless of race).",Jackson,0,
2022-009,602,"Furthermore, and importantly, the fact that UNC's holistic process ensures a full accounting makes it far from clear that any particular applicant of color will finish ahead of any particular nonminority applicant. For example, as the District Court found, a higher percentage of the most academically excellent in-state Black candidates (as SFFA's expert defined academic excellence) were denied admission than similarly qualified White and Asian American applicants.94 That, if nothing else, is indicative of a genuinely holistic process, it is evidence that, both in theory and in practice, UNC recognizes that race—like any other aspect of a person— may bear on where both John and James start the admissions relay, but will not fully determine whether either eventually crosses the finish line.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,605,"The majority seems to think that race blindness solves the problem of race-based disadvantage. But the irony is that requiring colleges to ignore the initial race-linked opportunity gap between applicants like John and James will inevitably widen that gap, not narrow it. It will delay the day that every American has an equal opportunity to thrive, regardless of race.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,606,"SFFA similarly asks us to consider how much longer UNC will be able to justify considering race in its admissions process. Whatever the answer to that question was yesterday, today's decision will undoubtedly extend the duration of our country's need for such race consciousness, because the justification for admissions programs that account for race is inseparable from the race-linked gaps in health, wealth, and well-being that still exist in our society (the closure of which today's decision will forestall).",Jackson,0,
2022-009,607,"To be sure, while the gaps are stubborn and pernicious, Black people, and other minorities, have generally been doing better.95  But those improvements have only been made possible because institutions like UNC have been willing to grapple forthrightly with the burdens of history. SFFA's complaint about the indefinite use of race-conscious admissions programs, then, is a non sequitur. These programs respond to deep-rooted, objectively measurable problems, their definite end will be when we succeed, together, in solving those problems.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,608,"Accordingly, while there are many perversities of today's judgment, the majority's failure to recognize that programs like UNC's carry with them the seeds of their own destruction is surely one of them. The ultimate goal of recognizing James's full story and (potentially) admitting him to UNC is to give him the necessary tools to contribute to closing the equity gaps discussed in Part I, supra, so that he, his progeny—and therefore all Americans— can compete without race mattering in the future. That intergenerational project is undeniably a worthy one.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,609,"In addition, and notably, that end is not fully achieved just because James is admitted. Schools properly care about preventing racial isolation on campus because research shows that it matters for students' ability to learn and succeed while in college if they live and work with at least some other people who look like them and are likely to have similar experiences related to that shared characteristic.96 Equally critical, UNC's program ensures that students who don't share the same stories (like John and James) will interact in classes and on campus, and will thereby come to understand each other's stories, which amici tell us improves cognitive abilities and critical-thinking skills, reduces prejudice, and better prepares students for postgraduate life.97",Jackson,0,
2022-009,610,"Beyond campus, the diversity that UNC pursues for the betterment of its students and society is not a trendy slogan. It saves lives. For marginalized communities in North Carolina, it is critically important that UNC and other area institutions produce highly educated professionals of color. Research shows that Black physicians are more likely to accurately assess Black patients' pain tolerance and treat them accordingly (including, for example, prescribing them appropriate amounts of pain medication).98 For high-risk Black newborns, having a Black physician more than doubles the likelihood that the baby will live, and not die.99 Studies also confirm what common sense counsels: Closing wealth disparities through programs like UNC's—which, beyond diversifying the medical profession, open doors to every sort of opportunity—helps address the aforementioned health disparities (in the long run) as well.100",Jackson,0,
2022-009,611,"Do not miss the point that ensuring a diverse student body in higher education helps everyone, not just those who, due to  their race, have directly inherited distinct disadvantages with respect to their health, wealth, and well-being. Amici explain that students of every race will come to have a greater appreciation and understanding of civic virtue, democratic values, and our country's commitment to equality.101 The larger economy benefits, too: When it comes down to the brass tacks of dollars and cents, ensuring diversity will, if permitted to work, help save hundreds of billions of dollars annually (by conservative estimates).102",Jackson,0,
2022-009,612,"Thus, we should be celebrating the fact that UNC, once a stronghold of Jim Crow, has now come to understand this. The flagship educational institution of a former Confederate State has embraced its constitutional obligation to afford genuine equal protection to applicants, and, by extension, to the broader polity that its students will serve after graduation. Surely that is progress for a university that once engaged in the kind of patently offensive race-dominated admissions process that the majority decries.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,613,"With its holistic review process, UNC now treats race as merely one aspect of an applicant's life, when race played a totalizing, all-encompassing, and singularly determinative role for applicants like James for most of this country's history: No matter what else was true about him, being Black meant he had no shot at getting in (the ultimate race-linked uneven playing field). Holistic programs like UNC's reflect the reality that Black students have only relatively recently been permitted to get into the admissions game at all. Such programs also reflect universities' clear-eyed optimism that, one day, race will no longer matter.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,614,"So much upside. Universal benefits ensue from holistic admissions programs that allow consideration of all factors material to merit (including race), and that thereby facilitate diverse student populations. Once trained, those UNC students who have thrived in the university's diverse learning environment are well equipped to make lasting contributions in a variety of realms and with a variety of colleagues, which, in turn, will steadily decrease the salience of race for future generations. Fortunately, UNC and other institutions of higher learning are already on this beneficial path. In fact, all that they have needed to continue moving this country forward (toward full achievement of our Nation's founding promises) is for this Court to get out of the way and let them do their jobs. To our great detriment, the majority cannot bring itself to do so.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,616,"The overarching reason the majority gives for becoming an impediment to racial progress—that its own conception of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause leaves it no other option—has a wholly self-referential, two-dimensional flatness. The majority and concurring opinions rehearse this Court's idealistic vision of racial equality, from Brown forward, with appropriate lament for past indiscretions. See, e.g., ante, at 2159-2160. But the race-linked gaps that the law (aided by this Court) previously founded and fostered—which indisputably define  our present reality—are strangely absent and do not seem to matter.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,617,"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces colorblindness for all by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life. And having so detached itself from this country's actual past and present experiences, the Court has now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are doing to solve America's real-world problems.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,618,"No one benefits from ignorance. Although formal race-linked legal barriers are gone, race still matters to the lived experiences of all Americans in innumerable ways, and today's ruling makes things worse, not better. The best that can be said of the majority's perspective is that it proceeds (ostrich-like) from the hope that preventing consideration of race will end racism. But if that is its motivation, the majority proceeds in vain. If the colleges of this country are required to ignore a thing that matters, it will not just go away. It will take longer for racism to leave us. And, ultimately, ignoring race just makes it matter more.103",Jackson,0,
2022-009,619,"The only way out of this morass—for all of us—is to stare at racial disparity unblinkingly, and then do what evidence and experts tell us is required to level the playing field and march forward together, collectively striving to achieve true equality for all Americans. It is no small irony that the judgment the majority hands down today will forestall the end of race-based disparities in this country, making the colorblind world the majority wistfully touts much more difficult to accomplish.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-009,620,"As the Civil War neared its conclusion, General William T. Sherman and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton convened a meeting of Black leaders in Savannah, Georgia. During the meeting, someone asked Garrison Frazier, the group's spokesperson, what freedom meant to him. He answered, `placing us where we could reap the fruit of our own labor, and take care of ourselves  to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor.'104",Jackson,0,
2022-009,621,"Today's gaps exist because that freedom was denied far longer than it was ever  afforded. Therefore, as Justice SOTOMAYOR correctly and amply explains, UNC's holistic review program pursues a righteous end—legitimate `because it is defined by the Constitution itself. The end is the maintenance of freedom.' Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 443-444, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968) (quoting Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1118 (1866) (Rep. Wilson)).",Jackson,0,
2022-009,622,"Viewed from this perspective, beleaguered admissions programs such as UNC's are not pursuing a patently unfair, ends-justified ideal of a multiracial democracy at all. Instead, they are engaged in an earnest effort to secure a more functional one. The admissions rubrics they have constructed now recognize that an individual's merit—his ability to succeed in an institute of higher learning and ultimately contribute something to our society—cannot be fully determined without understanding that individual in full. There are no special favorites here.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,623,"UNC has thus built a review process that more accurately assesses merit than most of the admissions programs that have existed since this country's founding. Moreover, in so doing, universities like UNC create pathways to upward mobility for long excluded and historically disempowered racial groups. Our Nation's history more than justifies this course of action. And our present reality indisputably establishes that such programs are still needed —for the general public good—because after centuries of state-sanctioned (and enacted) race discrimination, the aforementioned intergenerational race-based gaps in health, wealth, and well-being stubbornly persist.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,624,"Rather than leaving well enough alone, today, the majority is having none of it. Turning back the clock (to a time before the legal arguments and evidence establishing the soundness of UNC's holistic admissions approach existed), the Court indulges those who either do not know our Nation's history or long to repeat it. Simply put, the race-blind admissions stance the Court mandates from this day forward is unmoored from critical real-life circumstances. Thus, the Court's meddling not only arrests the noble generational project that America's universities are attempting, it also launches, in effect, a dismally misinformed sociological experiment.",Jackson,0,
2022-009,625,"Time will reveal the results. Yet the Court's own missteps are now both eternally memorialized and excruciatingly plain. For one thing—based, apparently, on nothing more than Justice Powell's initial say so—it drastically discounts the primary reason that the racial-diversity objectives it excoriates are needed, consigning race-related historical happenings to the Court's own analytical dustbin. Also, by latching onto arbitrary timelines and professing insecurity about missing metrics, the Court sidesteps unrefuted proof of the compelling benefits of holistic admissions programs that factor in race (hard to do, for there is plenty), simply proceeding as if no such evidence exists. Then, ultimately, the Court surges to vindicate equality, but Don Quixote style— pitifully perceiving itself as the sole vanguard of legal high ground when, in reality, its perspective is not constitutionally compelled and will hamper the best judgments of our world-class educational institutions about who they need to bring onto their campuses right now to benefit every American, no matter their race.105  The Court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore).106 It would be deeply unfortunate if the Equal Protection Clause actually demanded this perverse, ahistorical, and counterproductive outcome. To impose this result in that Clause's name when it requires no such thing, and to thereby obstruct our collective progress toward the full realization of the Clause's promise, is truly a tragedy for us all.",Jackson,0,

2022-011,35,"Despite the elimination of parole for capital defendants, the Arizona Supreme Court held, in a series of cases commencing with Cruz's direct appeal, that Simmons did not apply in Arizona because the State's sentencing scheme was sufficiently distinct from the one at issue in Simmons.1 That line of cases culminated in State v. Lynch, 238 Ariz. 84, 357 P.3d 119 (2015). There, the Arizona Supreme Court refused  to apply Simmons on the ground that Lynch could have received a life sentence under § 13-751(A) and thus been eligible for executive clemency after 25 years. 238 Ariz. at 103-104, 357 P.3d at 138-139.",Sotomayor,0,

The Court noted that Simmons expressly rejected the argument that the possibility of clemency diminishes a capital defendant's right to inform a jury of his parole ineligibility. 578 U.S. at 615, 136 S.Ct. 1818. The Court also observed that Simmons foreclosed the State's alternative argument that relied on the potential for future legislative reforms to Arizona's parole statute. 578 U.S. at 616, 136 S.Ct. 1818.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,38,"In 2005, Cruz was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a Tucson police officer. Cruz's conviction occurred over a decade after the decision in Simmons, but became final before the decision in Lynch.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,39,"At trial, Cruz repeatedly sought to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility. Citing Simmons, Cruz expressed concern that unless he had the opportunity to present the mitigating factor that he will not be released from prison, jurors would be left to speculate about Arizona's capital sentencing scheme and whether it allows for parole. App. 28-29. The trial court concluded that Simmons is distinguishable and did not act on Cruz's concern. Id., at 41.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,40,"Cruz also informed the trial court of his intent to call as a witness the chairman of the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency to testify that the board no longer had authority to parole any capital defendants. In response, the State sought to prevent Cruz from offering evidence as to the prospects of parole for an inmate sentenced to life imprisonment. Id., at 45. The trial court precluded the testimony.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,41,"During the aggravation/mitigation phase of an Arizona capital trial, the jury must first determine whether an aggravating circumstance exists. The jury here found a single aggravating factor that Cruz knowingly killed a police officer. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-703(F)(10) (2003) (renumbered as § 13-751(F)(8)). The jury then heard from 16 defense witnesses who testified to Cruz's good behavior in prison, his abuse and neglect as a child, his posttraumatic stress disorder, and his history of drug use, including around the time of the offense.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,42,"After counsel made closing arguments, the judge instructed the jury that Cruz was eligible for three penalties: (1) Death by lethal injection, (2) Life imprisonment with no possibility of parole or release from imprisonment on any basis, and (3) Life imprisonment with a possibility of parole or release from imprisonment after 25 years. App. 94. The reference to parole was plainly wrong. See Lynch, 578 U.S. at 615, 136 S.Ct. 1818 (the only release available under Arizona law is executive clemency, not parole). The judge further instructed the jury that its only choice was whether or not to sentence Cruz to death, if the jury did not vote for death, the judge would then choose between the two remaining possible sentences. The jury sentenced Cruz to death.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,43,"Three jurors, unprompted by Cruz, issued a press release the next day. The jurors explained that this had been a gut-wrenching decision and that there was not one per-son on the jury who did not cry. App. 144. They reported that they would rather have voted for life without the possibility of parole, but that they  were not given that option. A fourth juror later stated in a declaration: If I could have voted for a life sentence without parole, I would have voted for that option. Id., at 269.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,44,"Cruz thereafter moved for a new trial, arguing that the instructions did not give the jury an accurate and complete understanding of the consequences of a non-death verdict. Id., at 137. The trial judge denied the motion. He concluded, erroneously, that the jury had been correctly instructed on the law, and found it entirely speculative whether Cruz would be considered for parole after 25 years. Id., at 169-170.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,45,"On direct appeal, Cruz again pressed his Simmons claim. The Arizona Supreme Court rejected it. Repeating the same legal error made by the trial court, the court reasoned that Simmons was distinguishable because no state law would have prohibited Cruz's release on parole after serving twenty-five years.

2022-011,48,"After Cruz's conviction became final, this Court decided Lynch, thereby reaffirming that Simmons applies in Arizona. Cruz then filed a successive motion for state postconviction relief pursuant to Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(g). That Rule permits a successive petition for postconviction relief if there has been a significant change in the law that, if applicable to the defendant's case, would probably overturn the defendant's judgment or sentence. Cruz argued that Lynch was a significant change in the law because it had transformative effects on previously binding Arizona law. App. 387.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,49,"The Arizona Supreme Court denied relief after holding that Lynch was not a significant change in the law. 251 Ariz. at 207, 487 P.3d at 995.

Nevertheless, the Arizona Supreme Court held that Lynch was not a significant change in the law because the law relied upon by the Supreme Court in Lynch—Simmons—was clearly established at the time of Cruz's trial  despite the misapplication of that law by the Arizona courts. 251 Ariz. at 206, 487 P.3d, at 994.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,50,"In so holding, the Arizona Supreme Court rejected Cruz's argument that Lynch should qualify as a significant change in the law under Rule 32.1(g) because it significantly changed how Arizona applied federal law. 251 Ariz. at 207, 487 P.3d at 995. The Arizona Supreme Court responded, without citation to any of its prior cases, that Rule 32.1(g) requires a significant change in the law, whether state or federal—not a significant change in the application of the law. Ibid. (emphasis in original).",Sotomayor,0,

2022-011,53,"This Court will not take up a question of federal law in a case `if the decision of the state court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.'

Here the Court focuses on the second of these requirements: adequacy.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,54,"The question whether a state procedural ruling is adequate is itself a question of federal law. Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 60, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 L.Ed.2d 417 (2009). Ordinarily, a violation of a state procedural rule that is `firmly established and regularly followed'  will be adequate to foreclose review of a federal claim. Lee, 534 U.S. at 376, 122 S.Ct. 877. Nevertheless, in exceptional cases, a generally sound rule may be applied in a way that renders the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question. Ibid. This is one of those exceptional cases.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,55,"In particular, this case implicates this Court's rule, reserved for the rarest of situations, that an unforeseeable and unsupported state-court decision on a question of state procedure does not constitute an adequate ground to preclude this Court's review of a federal question. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). Novelty in procedural requirements cannot be permitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those who, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts of their federal constitutional rights. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 457, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). This Court has applied this principle for over a century. See, e.g., Enterprise Irrigation Dist. v. Farmers Mut. Canal Co., 243 U.S. 157, 165, 37 S.Ct. 318, 61 L.Ed. 644 (1917) (holding that a state ground was adequate where it was not without fair support, or so unfounded as to be essentially arbitrary, or merely a device to prevent a review of the other federal ground of the judgment). And this Court has continued to reaffirm this important rule. See Walker v. Martin, 562 U.S. 307, 320, 131 S.Ct. 1120, 179 L.Ed.2d 62 (2011) (A state ground, no doubt, may be found inadequate when `discretion has been exercised to impose novel and unforeseeable requirements without fair or substantial support in prior state law' (quoting 16B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4026, p. 386 (2d ed. 1996) (Wright & Miller))).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,56,"At issue here is the Arizona Supreme Court's decision that Cruz's motion for postconviction relief failed to satisfy Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(g). Rule 32.1(g) allows defendants to file a successive or untimely postconviction petition if there has been a significant change in the law. Arizona courts have interpreted that phrase to require a transformative event, a `clear break from the past.' Shrum, 220 Ariz. at 118, 203 P.3d at 1178 (quoting State v. Slemmer, 170 Ariz. 174, 182, 823 P.2d 41, 49 (1991) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). The archetype of such a change occurs when an appellate court overrules previously binding case law. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,57,"Straightforward application of these principles should have led to the conclusion that Lynch was a significant change in the law under Rule 32.1(g). Lynch overruled binding Arizona precedent. Before Lynch, Arizona courts held that capital defendants were not entitled to inform the jury of their parole ineligibility. After Lynch, Arizona courts recognize that capital  defendants have a due process right to provide the jury with that information when future dangerousness is at issue. It is hard to imagine a clearer break from the past.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,58,"Instead of reaching that conclusion, however, the Arizona Supreme Court held that Lynch was not a significant change in the law. 251 Ariz. at 207, 487 P.3d at 995. It reasoned that Lynch could not be a significant change because Lynch relied on Simmons, and Simmons was clearly established at the time of Cruz's trial  despite the misapplication of that law by the Arizona courts. 251 Ariz. at 206, 487 P.3d at 994. The court added that it was not enough that Lynch changed how Arizona courts applied federal law because Rule 32.1(g) requires a significant change in the law  not a significant change in the application of the law. 251 Ariz. at 207, 487 P.3d at 995 (emphasis in original).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,59,This interpretation of Rule 32.1(g) is entirely new and in conflict with prior Arizona case law. The State points to no other instance in which the overturning of binding Arizona precedent failed to satisfy Rule 32.1(g)'s significant change in the law requirement. Nor has the State identified any other Rule 32.1(g) decision distinguishing between a change in the law and a change in the application of the law. Ibid. (emphasis in original). The application of Rule 32.1(g) below is thus the opposite of firmly established and regularly followed.,Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,60,"What makes the interpretation so novel is the way in which it disregards the effect of Lynch on the law in Arizona. Ordinarily, Arizona courts applying Rule 32.1(g) focus on how a decision changes the law that is operative in Arizona, regardless of whether the intervening decision is a state or federal one. See, e.g., Shrum, 220 Ariz. at 119, 203 P.3d at 1179 (holding that a state decision did not satisfy Rule 32.1(g) because it did not overrule any prior opinion), State v. Valencia, 241 Ariz. 206, 208-209, 386 P.3d 392, 394-395 (2016) (finding a significant change in the law where a precedent of this Court changed the law applied in Arizona), State v. Poblete, 227 Ariz. 537, 540, 260 P.3d 1102, 1105 (App. 2011) (same), see also State v. Bigger, 251 Ariz. 402, 412, 492 P.3d 1020, 1030 (2021) (determining that a decision of this Court was not a significant change in the law in part because it did not effect a change in Arizona law). Here, however, the Arizona Supreme Court considered only whether there had been a significant change in federal law, disregarding the fact that Lynch overruled binding Arizona Supreme Court precedents, to dramatic effect for capital defendants in Arizona.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,61,"The consequences of the interpretation below compound its novelty. Arizona requires a petitioner seeking Rule 32.1(g) relief to establish not just a significant change in the law, but also that the law in question applies retroactively under this Court's analysis in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). See, e.g., State v. Towery, 204 Ariz. 386, 389, 64 P.3d 828, 831 (2003) (applying Teague). Under Arizona's longstanding Rule 32.1(g) precedents, it is possible to satisfy both criteria. See, e.g., State v. Rose, Order in No. CR2007-149013-002 (Super. Ct. Maricopa Cty., Ariz., Aug. 14, 2020) (determining in another case, prior to the decision below, that Lynch was both a significant change in the law and satisfied retroactivity because it merely applied the rule of Simmons). On the interpretation adopted below, however, it is impossible for Cruz, and similarly situated capital defendants, to obtain relief. To show retroactivity, Cruz argued before the Arizona Supreme Court that Lynch applied settled federal law. Under the decision below, however,  that same argument implies that Lynch was not a significant change in the law. The fact that the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in this case generates this catch-22, whereas earlier Rule 32.1(g) decisions did not, further underscores the novelty of the decision and its departure from pre-existing Arizona Supreme Court law.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,62,"Under these unusual circumstances, the Arizona Supreme Court's application of Rule 32.1(g) to Lynch was so novel and unfounded that it does not constitute an adequate state procedural ground. It is therefore not necessary to reach the further issue whether the decision below is independent of federal law.2",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,64,"The State and the dissent offer various reformulations of the argument that Lynch was not a significant change in the law for Rule 32.1(g) purposes, but each fails to grapple with the basic point that Lynch reversed previously binding Arizona Supreme Court precedent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,65,"Both the State and the dissent argue that the Arizona Supreme Court was justified in treating Lynch differently than other transformative decisions of this Court, such as Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), and Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), because Lynch was a summary reversal and so did not impose a new or changed interpretation of state or federal law. Brief for Respondent 12. As the dissent puts the argument: Lynch did not change the law in Arizona. Post, at 664 (opinion of BARRETT, J.).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,66,"These arguments miss the point. While Lynch did not change this Court's interpretation of Simmons, it did change the operative (and mistaken) interpretation of Simmons by Arizona courts. Lynch thus changed the law in Arizona in the way that matters for purposes of Rule 32.1(g): It overruled previously binding Arizona Supreme Court precedent preventing capital defendants from informing the jury of their parole ineligibility.3",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,67,"Contrary to the dissent, post, at 663, it makes no difference that Lynch did not alter federal law. While Arizona Supreme Court decisions applying Rule 32.1(g) to federal decisions such as Ring and Padilla have understandably noted the effect those decisions had on both federal and state law, the analytic focus of Arizona courts has always been on the impact to Arizona law. See supra, at 659-660, see also Towery, 204 Ariz. at 390, 64 P.3d at 832 (Ring imposes a new burden on the state. Thus we conclude that Ring satisfies Rule 32.1(g)). That focus is unsurprising given that Rule 32.1(g) is a state procedural rule governing the availability of state postconviction relief in state court.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,68,"The State next objects that a decision against it would forestall Arizona's ability to flesh out its Rule 32.1(g) jurisprudence  in new contexts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. That is incorrect. The Arizona Supreme Court is free to extend its prior Rule 32.1(g) jurisprudence, including by applying the Rule to new situations as they arise. What the Arizona Supreme Court cannot do is foreclose federal review by adopting a `novel and unforeseeable' approach to Rule 32.1(g) that lacks `fair or substantial support in prior state law.' Walker, 562 U.S. at 320, 131 S.Ct. 1120 (quoting 16B Wright & Miller § 4026, at 386).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,69,"The dissent argues that this case did present a new context because the Arizona Supreme Court had never before applied Rule 32.1(g) to a summary reversal. There was no reason, however, to treat this case any differently than past cases. Whereas the Arizona Supreme Court had previously looked to the effect of an intervening federal or state decision on Arizona law, supra, at 659-660, here it focused exclusively on whether there had been a change in federal law. The court thus disregarded that Lynch overruled previously binding case law in Arizona, the archetype of a significant change in the law. Shrum, 220 Ariz. at 118, 203 P.3d at 1178).4",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,70,"Finally, the dissent attempts to draw a parallel between Rule 32.1(g) and certain procedural rules governing federal prisoners seeking to file delayed or successive § 2255 motions. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2255(f), (h). The parallel breaks down, however, because the rules are different. Unlike § 2255(h)(2), which requires a new rule of federal constitutional law, and § 2255(f)(3), which requires a right newly recognized by the U. S. Supreme Court, the relevant portion of Arizona's Rule 32.1(g) simply requires a significant change in the law. As the Arizona Supreme Court has repeatedly interpreted that Rule, Lynch should qualify because it overruled binding Arizona precedent, creating a clear break from the past in Arizona courts. The Arizona Supreme Court's contrary decision was unprecedented and unforeseeable. Only violations of state rules that are `firmly established and regularly followed'  will be adequate to foreclose review of a federal claim. Lee, 534 U.S. at 376, 122 S.Ct. 877. That standard is not met here.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,71,"In exceptional cases where a state-court judgment rests on a novel and unforeseeable state-court procedural decision lacking fair or substantial support in prior state law, that decision is not adequate to preclude review of a federal question. The Arizona Supreme Court applied Rule 32.1(g) in a manner that abruptly departed from and directly conflicted with its prior  interpretations of that Rule. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",Sotomayor,0,

2022-011,74,"The adequate and independent state grounds doctrine is the product of two fundamental features of our jurisdiction. First, this Court is powerless to revise a state court's interpretation of its own law. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 636, 87 U.S. 590, 22 L.Ed. 429 (1875). We thus cannot disturb state-court rulings on state-law questions that are independent of federal law. Second, Article III empowers federal courts to render judgments, not advisory opinions. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, 2 U.S. 408, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1792). So if an independent state ground of decision is adequate to sustain the judgment, we lack jurisdiction over the entire dispute. Anything we said about alternative federal grounds would not affect the ultimate resolution of the case and would therefore be advisory. Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 126, 65 S.Ct. 459, 89 L.Ed. 789 (1945).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,75,"The Court holds that the Arizona Supreme Court's application of Rule 32.1(g) is inadequate to support the judgment below. That assertion is jarring, because the bar for finding inadequacy is extraordinarily high. When, as here, the argument is based on the state court's inconsistent or novel application of its law, the bar is met only by a decision so blatantly disingenuous that it reveals hostility to federal rights or those asserting them. See Walker v. Martin, 562 U.S. 307, 321, 131 S.Ct. 1120, 179 L.Ed.2d 62 (2011). Given the respect we owe state courts, that is not a conclusion we should be quick to draw— and ordinarily, we are not quick to draw it.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,76,"NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson illustrates how unprincipled a state-court decision must be before we treat it as inadequate. 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). There, the NAACP asked the Alabama Supreme Court to vacate a civil contempt order as unconstitutional. That court denied review on the ground that the NAACP had improperly pursued a writ of certiorari, when it should have sought a writ of mandamus. Id., at 454-455, 78 S.Ct. 1163. We held this procedural ruling inadequate because it was irreconcilable with the Alabama Supreme Court's past unambiguous holdings. Id., at 456, 78 S.Ct. 1163. Though a multitude of that court's own precedents contradicted its ruling, one in particular stood out: The court had evaluated similar constitutional claims brought by a petitioner in cahoots with the Ku Klux Klan, even though he had also pursued a writ of certiorari. Id., at 456-457, 78 S.Ct. 1163. The subtext of the Alabama Supreme Court's decision unmistakably revealed its hostility toward the NAACP's federal rights. See also Ford v. Georgia, 498 U.S. 411, 425, 111 S.Ct. 850, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991) (Georgia Supreme Court decision was inadequate because it applied precedent that was inapplicable by its own terms), Barr v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146, 149-150, 84 S.Ct. 1734, 12 L.Ed.2d 766 (1964) (South Carolina Supreme Court ruling was inadequate because that court had proceeded differently in an identical case a few weeks later).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,77,"Today's Court, while admitting that the novelty prong of inadequacy is reserved for the rarest of situations, ante, at 658, concludes that the Arizona Supreme Court's application of Rule 32.1(g) falls in the same category as Patterson. I respectfully disagree. Unlike the state courts in  cases like Patterson, the Arizona Supreme Court did not contradict its own settled law. Instead, it confronted a new question and gave an answer reasonably consistent with its precedent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,78,"The ordinary rule in Arizona is that criminal defendants must present any constitutional challenges on direct review or in a timely postconviction-review petition. Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a), 32.4(b)(3)(A) (2020). Rule 32.1(g) allows a second or delayed bite at the postconviction-relief apple when there has been a significant change in the law that, if applicable to the defendant's case, would probably overturn the defendant's judgment or sentence.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,79,"On several occasions, the Arizona Supreme Court has addressed whether an intervening judicial decision constitutes a significant change in the law for purposes of Rule 32.1(g). For instance, it has considered whether this Court's decisions significantly changed the content of federal law. E.g., State v. Bigger, 251 Ariz. 402, 412, 492 P.3d 1020, 1030 (2021) (a decision that affirmed the Supreme Court's jurisprudence was not a significant change), State v. Valencia, 241 Ariz. 206, 209, 386 P.3d 392, 395 (2016), see also State v. Poblete, 227 Ariz. 537, 540, 260 P.3d 1102, 1105 (App. 2011). It has also analyzed whether intervening state-court decisions significantly changed Arizona law. E.g., State v. Shrum, 220 Ariz. 115, 119-120, 203 P.3d 1175, 1179-1180 (2009), State v. Slemmer, 170 Ariz. 174, 179, 182, 823 P.2d 41, 46, 49 (1991), State v. Rendon, 161 Ariz. 102, 104, 776 P.2d 353, 355 (1989).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,80,"Cruz's case, however, raised a question of first impression: whether a significant change occurs when an intervening decision reaffirms existing law, but rectifies an erroneous application of that law. That was the effect of Lynch v. Arizona, 578 U.S. 613, 136 S.Ct. 1818, 195 L.Ed.2d 99 (2016) (per curiam), which corrected the Arizona Supreme Court's application of Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994) (plurality opinion), and its progeny. An intervening decision like Lynch, which undisputedly did not change any legal doctrine, has no analog in Arizona's Rule 32.1(g) jurisprudence. See ante, at 657 (Lynch reaffirmed that Simmons applies in Arizona (emphasis added)). So the Arizona Supreme Court devised a rule: Rule 32.1(g) requires a significant change in the law, whether state or federal—not a significant change in the application of the law. 251 Ariz. 203, 207, 487 P.3d 991, 995 (2021). By that standard, Lynch did not satisfy Rule 32.1(g). 251 Ariz. at 207, 487 P.3d at 995.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,81,"The Court criticizes the novelty of the Arizona Supreme Court's law versus application-of-law distinction, as it does not appear in any other Arizona precedent. Ante, at 659. A point that deserves emphasis at the outset: Novelty does not mean that a rule is inadequate merely because a state court announced it for the first time in the decision under review, and I do not understand the Court to suggest otherwise. Legal systems based on precedent depend on cases to present novel fact patterns, which enable courts to articulate new principles of law or to clarify old ones with greater precision. Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 65, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 L.Ed.2d 417 (2009) (Kennedy, J., concurring). We do a disservice to that mode of legal development when we disregard a state procedural ground that was not in all respects explicit before the case when it was first announced —unless, of course, the decision demonstrates a purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees. Ibid. That is why we have been careful to explain that, in the inadequacy context, a decision is `novel' only when it was wholly `unforeseeable' and lacked any  `fair or substantial support in prior state law.' Walker, 562 U.S. at 320, 131 S.Ct. 1120 (quoting 16B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4026, p. 386 (2d ed. 1996)).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,82,"The Court's real objection is that it thinks the Arizona Supreme Court violated its own Rule 32.1(g) precedent by holding that Lynch is not a significant change in law. For one, the Court says, the Arizona Supreme Court has previously explained that `the archetype' of a significant change occurs `when an appellate court overrules previously binding case law,' and Lynch overruled binding Arizona case law. Ante, at 658 (quoting Shrum, 220 Ariz. at 118, 203 P.3d at 1178). In isolation, that language does suggest that Lynch is a significant change for purposes of Rule 32.1(g). Context, however, shows there is more to the story: Shrum illustrated its point with the example of Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), which was a significant change because it overruled our contrary decision in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990). 220 Ariz. at 118-119, 203 P.3d at 1178-1179 (citing State v. Towery, 204 Ariz. 386, 390, 64 P.3d 828, 832 (2003)). Unlike Lynch, Ring changed the governing legal doctrine, not a mistaken application of that doctrine. So Shrum's reasoning is not inconsistent with the result below.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,83,"The Court also asserts that Arizona courts typically analyze how an intervening decision affects the law in Arizona, so by that logic, decisions like Lynch that change the law's on-the-ground application in Arizona constitute grounds for relief under Rule 32.1(g). Ante, at 659-660. I do not read the Arizona Supreme Court's past unambiguous holdings to say as much. Patterson, 357 U.S. at 456, 78 S.Ct. 1163. The closest example the Court offers is State v. Valencia, 241 Ariz. 206, 386 P.3d 392 (2016), in which the Arizona Supreme Court considered whether Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012), constituted a significant change in law. 241 Ariz. at 208, 386 P.3d at 394. The court observed that pre-Miller, Arizona law allowed trial courts to impose life sentences on juveniles without distinguishing crimes that reflected `irreparable corruption' rather than the `transient immaturity of youth.' Valencia, 241 Ariz. at 209, 386 P.3d at 395. Miller, in holding that trial courts must weigh such considerations before imposing a life sentence on juveniles, changed Eighth Amendment doctrine and therefore changed the law in Arizona. 241 Ariz. at 209, 386 P.3d at 395, see also Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U.S. 190, 208, 212, 136 S.Ct. 718, 193 L.Ed.2d 599 (2016). Lynch, by contrast, did not change the content of federal law and therefore did not change the law in Arizona.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,84,"If the Arizona Supreme Court's distinction between a change in law and a change in the application of law seems familiar, it should—federal habeas law draws the same line. Take everything about this case and transplant it to federal court: A federal defendant is wrongfully denied a Simmons instruction, the Court of Appeals's understanding of Simmons is later summarily reversed in Lynch, and the defendant (now a prisoner) then tries to obtain the benefit of Lynch through a successive or delayed motion for postconviction relief.* In this scenario, the federal prisoner faces the same dilemma that Cruz faces in Arizona. Pre-Lynch, the Court of Appeals was unreceptive to the Simmons claim.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,85,"Post-Lynch, the prisoner's claim is procedurally barred: Lynch is not a new rule of constitutional law or a newly recognized right because it merely applies an old rule, Simmons. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2255(f)(3), (h)(2). If federal law limits a prisoner's Simmons claim to an initial, timely motion, we should not be surprised that Arizona has made a similar choice. And we have cautioned before that federal habeas courts must not lightly `disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.' Johnson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 609, 136 S.Ct. 1802, 195 L.Ed.2d 92 (2016) (per curiam) (quoting Kindler, 558 U.S., at 62, 130 S.Ct., 612).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-011,86,"The Court makes a case for why the Arizona Supreme Court's interpretation of its own precedent is wrong. If I were on the Arizona Supreme Court, I might agree. But that call is not within our bailiwick. Our job is to determine whether the Arizona Supreme Court's decision is defensible, and we owe the utmost deference to the state court in making that judgment. Cases of inadequacy are extremely rare, and this is not one. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-012,34,"This case concerns the interplay between two statutes: 28 U.S.C. § 2241, the general habeas corpus statute, and § 2255, which provides an alternative postconviction remedy for federal prisoners. Since 1948, Congress has provided that a federal prisoner who collaterally attacks his sentence ordinarily must proceed by a motion in the sentencing court under § 2255, rather than by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under § 2241. To that end, § 2255(e) bars a federal prisoner from proceeding under § 2241 unless  the § 2255 remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,35,"Separately, since the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), second or successive § 2255 motions are barred unless they rely on either newly discovered evidence, § 2255(h)(1), or a new rule of constitutional law, § 2255(h)(2). A federal prisoner may not, therefore, file a second or successive § 2255 motion based solely on a more favorable interpretation of statutory law adopted after his conviction became final and his initial § 2255 motion was resolved.",Thomas,0,

2022-012,38,"In 2000, the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri convicted petitioner Marcus DeAngelo Jones of two  counts of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and one count of making false statements to acquire a firearm, in violation of § 922(a)(6). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his convictions and sentence of 327 months' imprisonment. See United States v. Jones, 266 F.3d 804 (2001). After losing his appeal, Jones filed a timely § 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, which resulted in the vacatur of one of his concurrent § 922(g) sentences but no other relief. See United States v. Jones, 403 F.3d 604 (CA8 2005), United States v. Jones, 185 Fed.Appx. 541 (CA8 2006) (per curiam).",Thomas,0,

S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 2191, 204 L.Ed.2d 594 (2019), this Court held that a defendant's knowledge of the status that disqualifies him from owning a firearm is an element of a § 922(g) conviction. In doing so, it abrogated the Eighth Circuit's contrary precedent, which the Western District of Missouri and the Eighth Circuit had applied in Jones' trial and direct appeal. See Jones, 266 F.3d at 810, n. 5.",Thomas,0,

But Rehaif's statutory holding satisfied neither of § 2255(h)'s gateway conditions for a second or successive § 2255 motion: It was neither newly discovered evidence, § 2255(h)(1), nor a new rule of constitutional law, § 2255(h)(2) (emphasis added). Unable to file a new § 2255 motion in his sentencing court, Jones instead looked to § 2255(e)'s saving clause, which provides that a federal prisoner may file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under § 2241 if—and only if—§ 2255's remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Invoking this clause, Jones petitioned the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the district where he was imprisoned, for a writ of habeas corpus under § 2241.",Thomas,0,

S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 2.

We begin by considering the role of the saving clause in § 2255 prior to AEDPA's enactment. We then consider the impact of AEDPA on the statutory scheme.",Thomas,0,

2022-012,49,"In understanding this statutory text, a page of history is worth a volume of logic. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349, 41 S.Ct. 506, 65 L.Ed. 963 (1921). Section 2255 is an outgrowth of the historic habeas corpus powers of the federal courts as applied to the special case of federal prisoners. The First Judiciary Act authorized the federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment, with a proviso that such writs could extend to prisoners in gaol only where they were in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or were committed for trial before some court of the same, or were necessary to be brought into court to testify. Act of Sept. 24, 1789, § 14, 1 Stat. 82. In 1867, Congress expanded the federal courts' habeas powers to cover all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States. Ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385. For most of our Nation's history, a federal prisoner claiming the right to be released, § 2255(a), in a collateral attack on his sentence would have relied on these Acts and their successors.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,50,"That changed with the 1948 recodification and reorganization of the Judiciary Code. See generally 62 Stat. 869. In enacting the present Title 28 of the United States Code, Congress largely recodified the federal courts' pre-existing habeas authority in §§ 2241 and 2243, which, respectively, confer the power to grant the writ and direct the issuing court to dispose of the matter as law and justice require. Id., at 964-965. At the same time, however, Congress created § 2255 as a separate remedial vehicle specifically designed for federal prisoners' collateral attacks on their sentences.1 Id., at 967-968.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,51,"The sole purpose of this innovation, as this Court acknowledged a few years later, was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another  and more convenient forum. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 219, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952), see also Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) (Section 2255 was intended to afford federal prisoners a remedy identical in scope to federal habeas corpus), accord, United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979), Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 427, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962). Experience had shown that processing federal prisoners' collateral attacks on their sentences through habeas proceedings—and, therefore, through the judicial districts in which they were confined—resulted in serious administrative problems. Hayman, 342 U.S. at 212, 72 S.Ct. 263. Most significantly, a federal prisoner's district of confinement was often far removed from the records of the sentencing court and other sources of needed evidence. Id., at 212-213, 72 S.Ct. 263. These difficulties were greatly aggravated by the concentration of federal prisoners in a handful of judicial districts, which forced those District Courts to process an inordinate number of habeas corpus actions. Id., at 213-214, 72 S.Ct. 263.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,52,"Section 2255 solved these problems by rerouting federal prisoners' collateral attacks on their sentences to the courts that had sentenced them. To make this change of venue effective, Congress generally barred federal prisoners authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to § 2255 from applying for a writ of habeas corpus under § 2241. § 2255(e). But, in a provision that has come to be known as the saving clause, Congress preserved the habeas remedy in cases where the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner's detention. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,53,"Traditionally, courts have treated the saving clause as covering unusual circumstances in which it is impossible or impracticable for a prisoner to seek relief from the sentencing court. The clearest such circumstance is the sentencing court's dissolution, a motion in a court that no longer exists is obviously inadequate or ineffective for any purpose. See, e.g., Witham v. United States, 355 F.3d 501, 504-505 (CA6 2004) (finding § 2255 inadequate or ineffective after court-martial was dissolved), Edwards v. United States, 1987 WL 7562, *1 (EDNY, Feb. 9, 1987) (finding § 2255 inadequate or ineffective after District Court of the Canal Zone was dissolved), cf. Spaulding v. Taylor, 336 F.2d 192, 193 (CA10 1964) (finding § 2255 inadequate or ineffective after Alaska territorial court was dissolved and federal and state successor courts declined § 2255 and state-habeas jurisdiction, respectively). The saving clause might also apply when it is not practicable for the prisoner to have his motion determined in the trial court because of his inability to be present at the hearing, or for other reasons.2  Hayman, 342 U.S. at 215, n. 23, 72 S.Ct. 263 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,54,"In addition, the saving clause ensures that § 2255(e) does not displace § 2241 when a prisoner challenges the legality of his detention without attacking the validity of his sentence. To give a few examples, a prisoner might wish to argue that he is being detained in a place or manner not authorized by the sentence, that he has unlawfully been denied parole or good-time credits, or that an administrative sanction affecting the conditions of his detention is illegal. See generally Samak v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, 766 F.3d 1271, 1280 (CA11 2014) (PRYOR, J., concurring) (explaining that the `detention' of a prisoner encompasses much more than a criminal `sentence'). The briefs before us debate whether these types of challenges depend on the saving clause or proceed under § 2241 directly. Compare Brief for Petitioner 31 and Brief for Respondent 37-38 with Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 17-18. It is difficult to imagine a case in which this logical distinction would make any practical difference. That said, were it not for the saving clause, a literal reading of § 2255(e) might be thought to bar any application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a federal prisoner, § 2255(e), whether or not it challenged the sentence imposed, § 2255(a). If nothing else, then, the saving clause guards against the danger that § 2255(e) might be construed to bar manner-of-detention challenges even though they are not within § 2255's substantive scope.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,56,"In 1996, Congress enacted AEDPA, which made significant reforms to the process of federal-court postconviction review for both state and federal prisoners. Most relevant here, AEDPA strictly limited second or successive § 2255 motions to those that contain—",Thomas,0,
2022-012,57,"(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense, or",Thomas,0,

2022-012,59,"Importantly, AEDPA left the text of § 2255(e) unchanged. But AEDPA's new second-or-successive restrictions indirectly gave rise to a novel application of the saving clause.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,60,"Mere months before AEDPA's enactment, this Court decided Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). That case interpreted the offense of using a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, in violation of then-existing 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), more narrowly than many Circuits' previous case law. See 516 U.S. at 142, 116 S.Ct. 501 (describing the Circuits' approaches). Under this Court's § 2255 precedent, Bailey's narrowing interpretation was grounds for a collateral attack by federal prisoners who had been convicted under the Courts of Appeals' broader interpretations. See Davis, 417 U.S. at 342-347, 94 S.Ct. 2298 (holding a claim of legal error based on an intervening change in statutory interpretation cognizable under § 2255). Many prisoners with Bailey claims, however, had already exhausted their first § 2255 motion, and Bailey's statutory holding plainly did not satisfy either of § 2255(h)'s conditions for a second or successive motion.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,61,"Several Courts of Appeals found a workaround for those prisoners in the saving  clause. With minor differences in reasoning and wording, they held that § 2255 was inadequate and ineffective under the saving clause—and that § 2241 was therefore available—when AEDPA's second-or-successive restrictions barred a prisoner from seeking relief based on a newly adopted narrowing interpretation of a criminal statute that circuit precedent had foreclosed at the time of the prisoner's trial, appeal, and first § 2255 motion. This application of the saving clause took shape in In re Dorsainvil, 119 F.3d 245, 251 (CA3 1997), Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 378-380 (CA2 1997), and In re Davenport, 147 F.3d 605, 609-611 (CA7 1998), and it was later adopted by most of the other Circuits. See Ivry v. Pontesso, 328 F.3d 1057, 1059-1060 (CA9 2003), Martin v. Perez, 319 F.3d 799, 804-805 (CA6 2003), Reyes-Requena v. United States, 243 F.3d 893, 904 (CA5 2001), In re Jones, 226 F.3d 328, 333-334 (CA4 2000), Wofford v. Scott, 177 F.3d 1236, 1242-1245 (CA11 1999), overruled by McCarthan v. Director of Goodwill Industries-Suncoast, Inc., 851 F.3d 1076 (CA11 2017) (en banc), but see Prost v. Anderson, 636 F.3d 578, 584-595 (CA10 2011) (GORSUCH, J.) (holding that § 2255(e) does not permit recourse to § 2241 in these circumstances).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,62,"We now hold that the saving clause does not authorize such an end-run around AEDPA. In § 2255(h), Congress enumerated two—and only two—conditions in which a second or successive § 2255 motion may proceed. Because § 2255 is the ordinary vehicle for a collateral attack on a federal sentence, the straightforward negative inference from § 2255(h) is that a second or successive collateral attack on a federal sentence is not authorized unless one of those two conditions is satisfied. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018), 138 S.Ct. 830, 844, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (`The expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others' (quoting A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 107 (2012))). Even more directly, § 2255(h)(2)'s authorization of a successive collateral attack based on new rules of constitutional law implies that Congress did not authorize successive collateral attacks based on new rules of nonconstitutional law. Had Congress wished to omit the word constitutional, it easily could have done so.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,63,"The saving clause does not undermine this strong negative inference. Basic principles of statutory interpretation require that we construe the saving clause and § 2255(h) in harmony, not set them at cross-purposes. See, e.g., United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988), Bend v. Hoyt, 13 Pet. 263, 272, 38 U.S. 263, 10 L.Ed. 154 (1839) (STORY, J.). That task is not difficult given the distinct concerns of the two provisions. Subsection (h) presumes—as part of its background—that federal prisoners' collateral attacks on their sentences are governed by § 2255, and it proceeds to specify when a second or successive collateral attack is permitted. The saving clause has nothing to say about that question. Rather, like subsection (e) generally, it addresses the antecedent question of the relationship between §§ 2241 and 2255.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,64,"After AEDPA, as before it, the saving clause preserves recourse to § 2241 in cases where unusual circumstances make it impossible or impracticable to seek relief in the sentencing court, as well as for challenges to detention other than collateral attacks on a sentence. Because AEDPA did not alter the text of § 2255(e), there is little reason to think that it altered the pre-existing division of labor between §§ 2241 and 2255. AEDPA's new restrictions on § 2255, therefore, are best understood as just that—restrictions on  § 2255—not as expansions of § 2241's applicability.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,65,"Any other reading would make AEDPA curiously self-defeating. It would mean that, by expressly excluding second or successive § 2255 motions based on nonconstitutional legal developments, Congress accomplished nothing in terms of actually limiting such claims. Instead, it would have merely rerouted them from one remedial vehicle and venue to another. Stranger still, Congress would have provided a superior remedy for the very nonconstitutional claims it chose not to include in § 2255(h). McCarthan, 851 F.3d at 1091. After escaping § 2255 through the saving clause, nonconstitutional claims would no longer be subject to AEDPA's other express procedural restrictions: the 1-year limitations period, see § 2255(f), and the requirement that a prisoner obtain a certificate of appealability before appealing an adverse decision in the District Court, see § 2253(c)(1).3 We generally resist attributing to Congress an intention to render a statute so internally inconsistent. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 251, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,66,"That resistance is particularly acute here, where allowing nonconstitutional claims to proceed under § 2241 would mean resurrecting the very problems § 2255 was supposed to put to rest. Wright v. Spaulding, 939 F.3d 695, 707 (CA6 2019) (THAPAR, J., concurring). Section 2255 owes its existence to Congress' pragmatic judgment that the sentencing court, not the District Court for the district of confinement, is the best venue for a federal prisoner's collateral attack on his sentence. Channeling a particular class of second or successive attacks back into § 2241 would mean once again concentrating `an inordinate number of habeas corpus actions' in districts with large prison populations and requiring District Courts to review each other's proceedings—often without access to the witnesses, the sources of evidence, or other local information that may be critical. Id., at 707-708 (quoting Hayman, 342 U.S. at 214, 72 S.Ct. 263). The illogical results of applying such an interpretation argue strongly against the conclusion that Congress intended these results. Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of Equalization of S. D., 480 U.S. 123, 133, 107 S.Ct. 1038, 94 L.Ed.2d 112 (1987).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,67,"Here, as often is the case, the best interpretation is the straightforward one. Section 2255(h) specifies the two limited conditions in which Congress has permitted federal prisoners to bring second or successive collateral attacks on their sentences. The inability of a prisoner with a statutory claim to satisfy those conditions does not mean that he can bring his claim in a habeas petition under the saving clause. It means that he cannot bring it at all. Congress has chosen finality over error correction in his case.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,69,"Resisting this reading, Jones and the United States both argue that § 2255(h)'s exclusion of statutory claims sometimes renders § 2255 inadequate or ineffective, though they advance different theories of when and why it does so. Their arguments are unpersuasive.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,71,"Jones begins with a textual interpretation of the saving clause that, if accepted, would convert § 2255(e) into a license for unbounded error correction. He argues that § 2255 is necessarily inadequate or ineffective to test a prisoner's claim if the § 2255 court fails to apply the correct substantive law. This argument ignores that the saving clause is concerned with the adequacy or effectiveness of the remedial vehicle (the remedy by motion), not any court's asserted errors of law. Cf. Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 383, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977) (holding a District of Columbia-court remedy modeled on § 2255 not to be `inadequate or ineffective' because the D. C. courts were competent to decide all issues). Even when circuit law is inadequate or deficient because a Court of Appeals' precedents have resolved a legal issue incorrectly, that is not a fault in the § 2255 remedial vehicle itself.4 Prost, 636 F.3d at 590.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,72,"Next, Jones offers a wide-ranging discussion of the concept of inadequacy as a term of art in traditional equity jurisprudence. While Jones demonstrates that courts of equity would afford relief from inadequate legal remedies in a broad range of circumstances, we find this excursus irrelevant to the question presented here. To the extent that Congress' use of inadequate in the saving clause harkens back to equity's historic use of that term (an issue we need not address), the most Jones' evidence proves is that a variety of circumstances might make it impracticable for a prisoner to seek relief from the sentencing court. Cf. Hayman, 342 U.S. at 215, n. 23, 72 S.Ct. 263. Nothing in Jones' survey of equity jurisprudence, however, even begins to suggest that the saving clause offers an exemption from AEDPA's clear limits on second or successive collateral attacks.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,73,"Trying a different tack, Jones suggests that the saving clause's use of the present tense (is inadequate or ineffective) means that § 2241 is available whenever a prisoner is presently unable to file a § 2255 motion. Even the Circuits with an expansive view of the saving clause have uniformly rejected this argument, and for good reason. See, e.g., In re Jones, 226 F.3d at 333, Dorsainvil, 119 F.3d at 251. Were this argument accepted, AEDPA's changes to § 2255 would be entirely futile, as § 2241 would be available any time the second-or-successive restrictions precluded relief. We decline to infer that Congress intended AEDPA's carefully crafted limits on collateral relief under § 2255 to be mere nullities.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,74,"As a backstop to his scattershot textual arguments, Jones invokes the constitutional-doubt canon, arguing that denying him the chance to raise his Rehaif claim in a § 2241 petition raises serious constitutional questions. It does not.5",Thomas,0,
2022-012,75,"Jones' primary constitutional argument is that denying him any opportunity to seek postconviction relief based on Rehaif would violate the Suspension Clause, which provides that the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it. U. S. Const., Art. I, § 9, cl. 2. This Suspension Clause argument fails because it would extend the writ of habeas corpus far beyond its scope `when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.' Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1959, 1963, 207 L.Ed.2d 427 (2020) (quoting Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 746, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008)). When the Suspension Clause was adopted, and for a long time afterward, Jones' Rehaif claim would not have been cognizable in habeas at all.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,76,"At the founding, a sentence after conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction was `in itself sufficient cause' for a prisoner's continued detention. Brown v. Davenport, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1510, 1520, 212 L.Ed.2d 463 (2022) (quoting Ex parte Watkins, 28 U.S. 193, 3 Pet. 193, 202, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830)). As Chief Justice Marshall explained in the seminal case of Ex parte Watkins, the criminal judgment, in its nature, concluded the subject on which it was rendered, pronounced the law of the case, and put an end to the inquiry concerning fact. Id., at 202-203. Of particular relevance here, a habeas court had no power to look beyond the judgment to re-examine the charges on which it was rendered for substantive errors of law—even if  the sentencing court had misconstrued the law, and had pronounced an offence to be punishable criminally, which was not so. Id., at 202, 209.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,77,"In rebuttal, Jones argues that pre-founding practice didallow habeas courts to look beyond the judgment to ensure that the convicting court had proved every element of the crime for which a prisoner was committed. But Jones fails to identify a single clear case of habeas being used to relitigate a conviction after trial by a court of general criminal jurisdiction. Rather, the cases he cites mostly involve commitments by justices of the peace,6 a distinction reflected in Watkins itself. See id., at 208 (discussing Ex parte Burford, 7 U.S. 448, 3 Cranch 448, 453, 2 L.Ed. 495 (1806), where the Court examined on habeas the sufficiency of a warrant of commitment by justices of the peace while noting that no judgment of a federal court was in question). At common law, justices of the peace were not courts of record and did not possess general criminal jurisdiction. Capital  Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 16-17, 19 S.Ct. 580, 43 L.Ed. 873 (1899), see also United States v. Mills, 11 App.D.C. 500, 507 (1897). As such, their commitments were not placed on the same high ground with the judgments of a court of record, and the fact that superior courts sometimes used habeas to examine commitments by such inferior magistrates furnishes no authority for inquiring into the judgments of a court of general criminal jurisdiction. Watkins, 3 Pet. at 209.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,78,"Jones also appeals to Bushell's Case, Vaugh. 135, 124 Eng. Rep. 1006 (C. P. 1670), which has long been understood as a case about the independence of criminal juries in determining questions of fact. Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 16-17, 53 S.Ct. 465, 77 L.Ed. 993 (1933), see also Sparf v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 90-93, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895), 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 375 (1883) (Stephen). There, a judge fined and imprisoned the members of a jury for acquitting William Penn and William Mead on indictments for assembling unlawfully and tumultuously, a verdict ostensibly against the manifest evidence. Vaugh., at 137, 124 Eng. Rep., at 1007. A juror refused to pay the fine, applied to the Court of Common Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus, and obtained discharge in an opinion by Chief Justice Vaughn. Jones points to one part of Vaughn's opinion, which criticized the return of the writ for not specifying that the jurors knew and believed the evidence to be full and manifest against the indicted persons, without which the jurors' verdict was no cause of fine or imprisonment. Id., at 142, 124 Eng. Rep., at 1009. Jones asks us to read this passage as reflecting a supposed common-law rule that habeas relief was available whenever a convicting court had not found the necessary mens rea of a crime. That reading, however, entirely misses the actual basis of Vaughn's opinion, which was the judge's absolute want of power to question the jury's determination of the facts. See id., at 149, 124 Eng. Rep., at 1013 (It is absurd a jury should be fined by the Judge for going against their evidence, when he who fineth knows not what it is . If it be demanded, what is the fact? the Judge cannot answer it), see also Stephen 375 (The judges who heard the argument decided that the discretion of the jury to believe the evidence or not could not be questioned). Thus, Bushell's Case no more undermines Watkins than do the justice-of-the-peace cases.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,79,"The principles of Watkins guided this Court's understanding of the habeas writ throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th. See Brown, 596 U. S., at ___, n. 1, 142 S.Ct. at 1521 n. 1 (collecting cases), see also Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 465-466, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Even in Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880), which held that the constitutionality of a prisoner's statute of conviction could be reviewed on habeas (as going to jurisdiction),7 the Court acknowledged Watkins and took pains to reconcile its holding with the traditional rule. See 100 U.S. at 375-377. And, when asked to review convicting courts' substantive errors of statutorylaw in habeas corpus proceedings, this Court consistently  held that it could not do so.8 It was not until 1974, in Davis, that the Court broke with that tradition, holding for the first time that a substantive error of statutory law could be a cognizable ground for a collateral attack on a federal court's criminal judgment. See 417 U.S. at 342-347, 94 S.Ct. 2298.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,80,"The Suspension Clause does not constitutionalize that innovation of nearly two centuries later. Nor, a fortiori, does it require the extension of that innovation to a second or successive collateral attack.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,81,"Jones' remaining constitutional arguments are no more persuasive. He argues that denying him a new opportunity for collateral review of his Rehaif claim threatens separation-of-powers principles —specifically, Congress' exclusive power to define crimes Cf. United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34, 11 U.S. 32, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812). But the authority to determine the facts and the law in an  individual case, and to render a final, binding judgment based on those determinations, stands at the core of the judicial power. See Plant v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218-219, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995), Watkins, 3 Pet. at 202-203. A court does not usurp legislative power simply by misinterpreting the law in a given case. See id., at 206 (If its judgment was erroneous, a point which this court does not determine, still it is a judgment).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,82,"Next, Jones points to Fiore v. White, 531 U.S. 225, 121 S.Ct. 712, 148 L.Ed.2d 629 (2001) (per curiam), which applied the rule that due process requires that the prosecution prove every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See id., at 228-229, 121 S.Ct. 712. Whether a due process error has occurred at trial, however, is an entirely different issue from Congress' power to restrict collateral review. Due process does not guarantee a direct appeal, McKane v. Durston, 153 U.S. 684, 687, 14 S.Ct. 913, 38 L.Ed. 867 (1894), let alone the opportunity to have legal issues redetermined in successive collateral attacks on a final sentence.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,83,"Jones' last constitutional contention —that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments may entitle him to another round of collateral review—fails for a similar reason. By its terms, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause expresses a substantive constraint on the kinds of punishments governments may inflict. It creates no freestanding entitlement to a second or successive round of postconviction review, and thus it adds nothing to Jones' unavailing Suspension Clause argument.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,85,"The Government agrees with the Eighth Circuit that Jones is not entitled to relief, but, somewhat surprisingly, it asks us to adopt a novel, alternative interpretation of the saving clause, which it constructs via a roundabout argument. It begins with the premise that the words inadequate or ineffective imply reference to a benchmark of adequacy and effectiveness. It proceeds to identify that benchmark as the ability to test the types of claims cognizable under the general habeas statutes— specifically, those governing federal habeas petitions by state prisoners. The Government then reasons that § 2255(h)'s limitations on second or successive motions asserting newly discovered evidence or new rules of constitutional law do not trigger the saving clause because Congress has imposed analogous limitations on analogous claims by state prisoners and—by doing so—has redefined § 2255(e)'s implicit habeas benchmark with respect to such factual and constitutional claims. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(b)(2)(A)-(B). Since, the Government asserts, Congress has imposed no analogous limitation on statutory claims by state prisoners, it has not redefined the implicit habeas benchmark with respect to statutory claims like Jones'. And, we should be unwilling to infer that AEDPA limited such claims without a clearer textual indication. The Government concludes that § 2255(h) renders § 2255 inadequate or ineffective to test a federal prisoner's statutory claim in cases where the prisoner has already filed one § 2255 motion and the claim otherwise satisfies pre-AEDPA habeas principles, which generally will require a `colorable showing of factual innocence.' McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 495, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991) (quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 454, 106 S.Ct. 2616, 91 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986) (plurality opinion)).9  This elaborate theory is no more convincing than Jones' arguments. Its most striking flaw is the seemingly arbitrary linkage it posits between the saving clause and state prisoners' statutory postconviction remedies. While it is true that § 2255, as enacted, afforded the same rights federal prisoners previously enjoyed under the general habeas statutes, see Hayman, 342 U.S. at 219, 72 S.Ct. 263, nothing in § 2255's text, structure, or history suggests that Congress intended any part of it to implicitly cross-reference whatever modifications to state prisoners' postconviction remedies might be made in the future. Understanding the saving clause to do so would have highly counterintuitive implications: On the Government's view, §§ 2255(h)(1) and (h)(2) do not create an adequacy or effectiveness problem only because of the parallel state-prisoner provisions in § 2244(b). It seems to follow that if Congress relaxed § 2244(b)'s second-or-successive restrictions for state prisoners tomorrow, and did nothing else, § 2255 would suddenly become inadequate or ineffective to test at least some second or successive fact-based claims that did not satisfy § 2255(h)(1) or constitutional claims that did not satisfy § 2255(h)(2), and that those claims would then be allowed to proceed under § 2241. We see no indication that the spare language of the saving clause creates such a Rube Goldberg contrivance, whereby changes to other statutory provisions (which do not apply to federal prisoners at all) could flow back into § 2255 and undermine § 2255(h).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,86,"In any event, as the Government acknowledges, a state prisoner could never bring a pure statutory-error claim in federal habeas, because `federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.' Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780, 110 S.Ct. 3092, 111 L.Ed.2d 606 (1990)). As a result, it is unclear what work the Government's state-prisoner-habeas benchmark is even doing in its answer to the question presented here.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,87,"Rather, the narrow base on which the Government's top-heavy theory ultimately turns out to rest is its assertion that § 2255(h) is simply not clear enough to  support the inference that Congress entirely closed the door on pure statutory claims not brought in a federal prisoner's initial § 2255 motion. See Brief for Respondent 28-29, 39. That assertion is unpersuasive for the reasons we have already explained: § 2255(h) specifies the two circumstances in which a second or successive collateral attack on a federal sentence is available, and those circumstances do not include an intervening change in statutory interpretation.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,88,"The Government asserts that we require the clearest command before construing AEDPA to close the courthouse doors on a strong equitable claim for relief. Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 646, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The only two cases the Government relies on for its clear-statement rule do not sweep as broadly as it suggests. In Holland, we applied the general presumption of equitable tolling to AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations for state prisoners' habeas claims. Id., at 645-649, 130 S.Ct. 2549. Afterward, in McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013), we held that a convincing showing of actual innocence could enable a prisoner to evade AEDPA's statute of limitations entirely. Id., at 386, 133 S.Ct. 1924.",Thomas,0,
2022-012,89,"Undoubtedly, McQuiggin's assertion of equitable authority to override clear statutory text was a bold one. But even taking Holland and McQuiggin for all they are worth, there is a significant difference between reading equitable exceptions into a statute of limitations, on the one hand, and demanding a clear statement before foreclosing workarounds to AEDPA's second-or-successive restrictions, on the other. Statutes of limitations merely govern the timeframe for bringing a claim. AEDPA's second-or-successive restrictions, by contrast, constitute a modified res judicata rule, Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996), and thus embody Congress' judgment regarding the central policy question of postconviction remedies— the appropriate balance between finality and error correction. Insisting on a heightened standard of clarity in this context would effectively mean adopting a presumption against finality as a substantive value. We decline to do so. The United States has an interest in the finality of sentences imposed by its own courts, Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S. 295, 309, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005), and how to balance that interest against error correction is a judgment about the proper scope of the writ that is `normally for Congress to make.' Felker, 518 U.S. at 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333 (quoting Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 323, 116 S.Ct. 1293, 134 L.Ed.2d 440 (1996)).",Thomas,0,
2022-012,90,"Accepting the Government's proposal to apply a clear-statement rule would be particularly anomalous in light of the precise question this case presents. Typically, we find clear-statement rules appropriate when a statute implicates historically or constitutionally grounded norms that we would not expect Congress to unsettle lightly. See, e.g., Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2485, 2489, 210 L.Ed.2d 856 (2021) (per curiam) (presumption that Congress does not casually assign executive agencies powers of vast economic and political significance or significantly alter the balance between federal and state power (internal quotation marks omitted)), Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265-266, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994) (presumption against statutory retroactivity), Atascadero State Hospital v.

But, as shown above in discussing Jones' Suspension Clause argument, there is no historical or constitutional norm of permitting one convicted of a crime by a court of competent jurisdiction to collaterally attack his sentence based on an alleged error of substantive statutory law. As far as history and the Constitution are concerned, there is nothing incongruous about a system in which this kind of error —the application of a since-rejected statutory interpretation—cannot be remedied after final judgment. George v. McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1953, 1962, 213 L.Ed.2d 265 (2022).

A prisoner who is actually innocent, imprisoned for conduct that Congress did not criminalize, is forever barred by 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h) from raising that claim, merely because he previously sought postconviction relief. It does not matter that an intervening decision of this Court confirms his innocence. By challenging his conviction once before, he forfeited his freedom.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-012,96,"Though we agree with Justice JACKSON that this is not the scheme Congress designed, we see the matter as the Solicitor General does. As all agree, Congress enacted § 2255 to afford federal prisoners a remedy identical in scope to federal habeas corpus. Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). To ensure that equivalence, Congress built in a saving clause, allowing recourse to habeas when the remedy by motion under § 2255 is inadequate or ineffective compared to the remedy it replaced: an application for a writ of habeas corpus. § 2255(e). So, as this Court has explained, if § 2255 bars a claim cognizable at habeas, such that the remedies are not commensurate, the saving clause kicks in, and the prisoner may proceed in federal habeas corpus. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 14-15, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), see United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 223, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952).",Sotomayor,0,

But that claim is cognizable at habeas, where we have long held that federal prisoners can collaterally attack their convictions in successive petitions if they can make a colorable showing that they are innocent under an intervening decision of statutory construction. See Davis, 417 U.S. at 344-347, 94 S.Ct. 2298, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 493-495, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). Congress did not abrogate that principle in § 2255(h).

See Part I, infra. This stingy characterization does not reflect a primary aim of § 2255(e), which was to save any claim that was available prior to § 2255(h)'s enactment where Congress has not expressed a clear intent to foreclose it.

2022-012,102,"I am also deeply troubled by the constitutional implications of the nothing-to-see-here approach that the majority takes with respect to the incarceration of potential legal innocents. See Part III, infra. Apparently, legally innocent or not, Jones must just carry on in prison regardless, since (as the majority reads § 2255) no path exists for him to ask a federal judge to consider his innocence assertion. But forever slamming the courtroom doors to a possibly innocent person who has never had a meaningful opportunity to get a new and retroactively applicable claim for release reviewed on the merits raises serious constitutional concerns.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,103,"Thus, in my view, all roads lead to an interpretation of § 2255 that is diametrically opposed to the one that the majority announces. Whether one gets there by virtue of a proper reading of § 2255(e) or an informed understanding of § 2255(h), or by affording due respect to the core constitutional interests at stake, Jones's successive petition alleging legal innocence should have been considered on the merits.2 Therefore, I respectfully dissent.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,105,"Section 2255(e) saves postconviction claims by authorizing the filing of a habeas petition under § 2241 if the procedures § 2255 affords are inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner's detention. § 2255(e). I see no reason why the only circumstance in which § 2255's procedures qualify as inadequate or ineffective for saving clause purposes is when  it is impossible or impractical for a prisoner to file a § 2255 motion. Contra, ante, at 1866-1867. Quite to the contrary, the enactment history of § 2255 plainly establishes that Congress wanted to ensure that a prisoner's claim was saved in at least one additional set of circumstances: Where the prisoner would have been able to bring such a claim prior to the enactment of § 2255 (or any subsequent changes, like those made by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)), but somehow cannot bring that claim after a change to the statutory framework (unless Congress has clearly expressed its intent to restrict the scope of relief in that regard). As the majority has interpreted § 2255(h), that is precisely the situation here.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,107,"To understand why Congress meant for Jones to be able to invoke the saving clause and bring his statutory innocence claim in a habeas petition filed under § 2241, a firm grasp of the text, history, and intended operation of § 2255(e) is required.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,109,"The saving clause is the latter part of § 2255(e), which states in full:",Jackson,0,
2022-012,110,"An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. § 2255(e) (emphasis added), see also § 2255 (1946 ed., Supp. II) (§ 2255 (1948)).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,111,"Before § 2255 was enacted in 1948, federal prisoners collaterally attacked their convictions by filing a habeas petition. See United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 210-213, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952). Such petitions sought judicial review of the legality of the individual's detention, and were filed in the district where the person was incarcerated. Ibid. This led to some problems: Districts that housed large federal prisons were disproportionately burdened with habeas petitions. Id., at 213-214, 72 S.Ct. 263. Also, in many cases, the court deciding the petition was both unfamiliar with the underlying facts and far away from the relevant record, evidence, and witnesses. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,112,"Congress created § 2255—an entirely new process for federal prisoners to use when seeking postconviction judicial review —to solve these practical problems. Ante, at 1865-1866. Under the procedures laid out in § 2255, in lieu of filing a traditional habeas petition, federal prisoners must file a § 2255 motion. And any such motion is to be filed in the sentencing court, not in the district of confinement. § 2255(a) (2018 ed.), see Hayman, 342 U.S. at 219, 72 S.Ct. 263.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,113,"Congress crafted (what is now) § 2255(e) to ensure that the new § 2255 procedure successfully ousted the outdated habeas regime it replaced. Per the first part of that provision, as a general matter, § 2255 becomes the exclusive procedure by which federal prisoners can collaterally attack their convictions. See § 2255(e) (providing that an application for a writ of habeas corpus  shall not be entertained where, in essence, the prisoner fails to bring an authorized § 2255 motion, or does so and is denied relief). Yet Congress also specified that, in a circumstance in which § 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,  an individual could still file a habeas petition. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,114,"There are multiple ways in which § 2255 might be insufficient or not capable of performing the required work of postconviction review of federal convictions. Webster's New International Dictionary 1254, 1271 (2d ed. 1934) (defining inadequate and ineffective in this manner), see also Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 1239, 1255 (1942) (similar). For example, § 2255 would not be up to the task if it would be impossible or impracticable for a federal prisoner to file a § 2255 petition. Ante, at 1866, 1868-1869.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,115,"The case before us involves another way that § 2255 can be inadequate or ineffective —where the newly created § 2255 procedure, perhaps inadvertently, blocks a prisoner from bringing a claim that was previously cognizable in habeas. This is an inadequacy concerning the operation of § 2255 from Congress's perspective, because the sole purpose of § 2255 was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings while still affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum. Hayman, 342 U.S. at 219, 72 S.Ct. 263 (emphasis added), see also Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) (The history makes clear that § 2255 was intended to afford federal prisoners a remedy identical in scope to federal habeas corpus (emphasis added)), Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 14, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963) (It conclusively appears from the historic context in which § 2255 was enacted that the legislation was intended simply to provide in the sentencing court a remedy exactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted)).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,116,"That much is not in dispute—the majority acknowledges that Congress intended to maintain equivalence with the claims available in habeas when it enacted § 2255. See ante, 1865-1866. Consequently, in any circumstance in which the new § 2255 procedure actually operates to foreclose a postconviction claim that a prisoner could have brought previously in a habeas petition, the § 2255 process is patently inadequate to accomplish Congress's aim of allowing prisoners to test the legality of their detention under § 2255 to the same extent as they could have in the habeas regime that § 2255 replaced.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,117,"Thus, the saving clause can be properly interpreted as effectuating Congress's intent in this regard. As the Government persuasively argues, by inserting a provision that allows prisoners to still file habeas petitions, Congress ensured that Section 2255 does not disadvantage federal prisoners as compared to habeas. Brief for Respondent 17, see also Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 776, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008) (noting that the purpose of § 2255 was to strengthen, rather than dilute, the writ's protections and further recognizing that the saving clause served that purpose). That is, where a federal prisoner could have brought a particular habeas claim prior to 1948, but could not bring such a claim in a § 2255 petition after that date, the saving clause kicks in to permit that individual to resort to habeas to raise that claim.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,118,"This reading of § 2255(e) means that the saving clause operates (at the very least, and as it was enacted in 1948) to preserve from inadvertent extinguishment postconviction claims that would have been previously cognizable for federal prisoners but cannot be brought by operation of § 2255. And the flip side of that interpretation— that § 2255 is inadequate or ineffective if it sub silentio extinguishes previously available  habeas claims, triggering the saving clause—inexorably follows. This interpretation tracks Congress's clear claim-preservation goal. And, as an added bonus, it also has the benefit of being in accordance with how saving clauses usually work. See 2 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction § 4830, pp. 376-377 (3d ed. 1943) (defining saving clause as a provision said to preserve from destruction certain rights, remedies or privileges which would otherwise be destroyed by the general enactment), see, e.g., Andrus v. Shell Oil Co., 446 U.S. 657, 666, 100 S.Ct. 1932, 64 L.Ed.2d 593 (1980) (noting that Congress included a savings clause in the statute at issue to preserve pre-existing claims), United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 535, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955) (noting that the purpose of a saving clause in the immigration context was to manifest a well-established congressional policy not to strip noncitizens of advantages gained under prior laws).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,120,"Fast forward to 1996: Congress reenacted the saving clause—using identical language—when it passed AEDPA. § 2255(e), § 2255 (1948). Thus, because the saving clause operated in 1948 to save from inadvertent extinguishment habeas claims that were available before the enactment of § 2255, the same was true when Congress revised those procedures in the mid-1990s, while keeping the saving clause intact. In other words, both in 1948 and to this day, the saving clause operates to (among other things) ensure that § 2255—or the AEDPA amendments —did not, through inapt language, substantively alter the scope of available postconviction relief for federal prisoners.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,121,"This is not to say that Congress necessarily carried forward all of its previous policy determinations with respect to the availability of postconviction claims, or that it did not change its mind at all about the appropriate dimensions of postconviction relief. Indeed, habeas is a dynamic remedy, and congressional enactments contribute to its evolution. See Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996), see also 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 28.4a, p. 1738 (7th ed. 2020) (Hertz & Liebman) (Anglo-American law  has imposed an evolving set of restrictions on second and subsequent petitions). But, again, the saving clause—which served an important equalizing function—remained intact when Congress reenacted § 2255 in 1996. Thus, while Congress can certainly act to change the scope of habeas or its statutory equivalent if it wants to do so, in order to overcome the operation of the saving clause (which, again, was inserted to maintain equivalence in the absence of intent to make a change), Congress has to make said change to the availability of postconviction relief deliberately and clearly, thereby unequivocally expressing its intent to do so. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 646, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), infra, at 1891-1893.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,122,"All this means that today (as in 1948) the saving clause is best interpreted as allowing for the filing of a habeas petition under § 2241 where a claim that was cognizable prior to AEDPA cannot be brought under § 2255, unless Congress has clearly expressed its intent to foreclose that particular claim.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,124,"That brings us to the situation at issue here. When Congress amended § 2255 by enacting AEDPA, it legislated against a legal background in which a federal prisoner could bring a statutory innocence claim in a § 2255 petition. The majority does not  dispute this. See ante, at 1872-1874. Nor could it, because this Court made crystal clear in 1974 in Davis that statutory innocence claims are legally cognizable in a § 2255 motion. 417 U.S. at 343-347, 94 S.Ct. 2298.3",Jackson,0,
2022-012,125,"Moreover, prior to AEDPA's enactment, a federal prisoner could bring such a postconviction claim of statutory innocence in a successive petition. This Court had generally restricted successive postconviction filings by the 1990s, but a prisoner who had previously filed at least one petition could still file another one in order to assert innocence. That was because any bar to the filing of a successive petition was typically lifted if enforcing that bar would result in a miscarriage of justice. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 494-495, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), Hertz & Liebman § 28.4g, at 1757, see Brief for Respondent 22-24. And under our settled precedent, legal innocence claims fit that category. See Davis, 417 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (There can be no room for doubt that conviction and punishment  for an act that the law does not make criminal `inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice'), see also Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623-624, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,126,"These background principles relate to the successive petition that Jones seeks to bring here as follows. If the majority is right that (by virtue of § 2255(h)) prisoners like Jones are now unable to bring a successive § 2255 petition to make the same kind of legal innocence claim that they could have brought prior to AEDPA, then Congress's enactment of § 2255(h) has dramatically altered the legal landscape in a manner that seems, at best, inconsistent with its original intent. To repeat: The saving clause expresses a congressional intent to maintain equivalence between what a prisoner could claim before and after § 2255(h), yet under the majority's reading, § 2255(h)'s second or successive bar would effectively operate to preclude successive legal innocence claims—shrinking the universe of previously available claims—the opposite of what Congress set out to do when it set up § 2255.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,127,"In my view, that is where the saving clause comes in. Reading the saving clause to perform its normal, intended function of saving previously available claims solves this problem, because it allows prisoners who could have brought a claim prior to the enactment of AEDPA (like Jones) to file a habeas petition to the extent that § 2255 now precludes such a filing under that particular statutory mechanism. Thus, interpreting § 2255(e)'s inadequate and ineffective language to permit the filing of a habeas petition that raises a legal innocence claim in these circumstances seems perfectly consistent with Congress's intent.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,128,"This understanding of the saving clause also explains the clause's application—or, more precisely, its inapplicability—to the types of claims specifically mentioned in §§ 2255(h)(1) and (2). Congress has expressly overridden operation of the saving clause with respect to those two provisions, because it has clearly expressed its intent to narrow the scope of postconviction relief where a federal prisoner brings a successive petition raising a claim of new evidence  or new constitutional law.4 A legislature may adopt a policy different from that embodied in the general saving statute. M. Ruud, The Savings Clause—Some Problems in Construction and Drafting, 33 Texas L. Rev. 285, 299 (1955). And here, no one questions that, with §§ 2255(h)(1) and (2), Congress clearly did so. Brief for Respondent 26-28. But the majority now reasons that, merely by omitting statutory innocence claims from that authorized-filings list, Congress should be deemed to have exhibited a narrowing intent with respect to those claims as well. See ante, at 1863-1864, 1869-1870.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,129,"I disagree. Indeed, in my view, it is precisely because the text of §§ 2255(h)(1) and (2) speaks unequivocally to the narrowing Congress wished to effect with respect to new-evidence and new-constitutional claims that we should not ascertain that Congress meant for the second or successive bar to have the same effect with respect to legal innocence claims—which, importantly, the statute does not mention. To put it bluntly: Congress knows how to speak clearly when it wants to disrupt the continuity of claims that are available to prisoners before and after it enacts legislation that addresses postconviction review procedures. And rather than providing any such clear statement as to how an intervening claim of statutory innocence should be treated vis-à-vis § 2255(h)'s second or successive bar, Congress was conspicuously silent.5",Jackson,0,
2022-012,131,"The majority advances an entirely different theory of the work that § 2255(e) does with respect to the postconviction review scheme—a theory that I do not find even remotely persuasive. Opting for the narrowest possible view of Congress's intent regarding the saving clause, the majority generally claims that the saving clause only authorizes the filing of a habeas  petition if filing a § 2255 motion would be impossible or impracticable. Ante, at 1866, 1868. And in the majority's telling, that circumstance only occurs, say, if the courthouse where a § 2255 motion would have otherwise been filed has burned to the ground or been carried away by a mudslide. The majority's parsimonious perspective on the meaning of inadequate or ineffective is flawed in many respects.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,132,"First and foremost, it is entirely atextual. The majority cites exactly zero dictionary definitions of the terms inadequate or ineffective. And while it does reference an earlier draft of the legislation that became § 2255, ante, at 1866-1867 (quoting Hayman, 342 U.S. at 215, n. 23, 72 S.Ct. 263), it fails to mention that Congress specifically rejected language that embraced the majority's impracticable only proposition. See Hayman, 342 U.S. at 215, n. 23, 72 S.Ct. 263, In re Dorsainvil, 119 F.3d 245, 250 (CA3 1997).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,133,"Furthermore, while the majority opinion accurately recites the history and purpose of § 2255, see ante, at 1865-1866, it ignores the import of that history. As explained above, when Congress enacted § 2255 in 1948, it intended to ensure equivalence between traditional habeas and the new § 2255 mechanism for postconviction review. Supra, at 1880. Accordingly, Congress inserted the saving clause to ensure that certain pre-existing postconviction claims (say, a claim of statutory innocence) could still be heard even if the statutory language Congress was adopting inadvertently barred them. Supra, at 1879-1881. And Congress preserved the language of § 2255(e)—the language that performs the equalizing function—in 1996, even as it made other significant changes to § 2255. Supra, at 1881-1882.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,134,"Ignoring all this, the majority grounds its analysis of § 2255(e) in a scattershot of lower court cases that the majority claims traditionally viewed the saving clause as solving only for practical filing problems. Ante, at 1866-1867. To be sure, a handful of lower courts applied the saving clause where the sentencing court was dissolved. Ibid. But lower courts have also traditionally, ante, at 1866, treated the saving clause as permitting individuals with previously unavailable statutory innocence claims to file habeas petitions in light of § 2255(h)'s successive-petition bar. Prost v. Anderson, 636 F.3d 578, 605 (CA10 2011) (SEYMOUR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).6 The majority also fails to grapple with this Court's own opinions that suggest a broader interpretation of the saving clause is proper. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 381-382, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977), Sanders, 373 U.S. at 14-15, 83 S.Ct. 1068, Hayman, 342 U.S. at 223, 72 S.Ct. 263, Brief for Respondent 17-18.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,135,"It appears the majority's interpretation of § 2255(e) is primarily attributable to its concern that interpreting the saving clause to permit Jones to file a habeas petition might authorize an end-run around § 2255's procedures. Ante, at 1868-1869, 1870-1871. I think those fears are vastly overblown.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,136,"Properly interpreted, a § 2255 motion is only inadequate or ineffective when the potential procedural bar does not provide a  prisoner with any meaningful opportunity to present a claim. And that circumstance does not exist any time a procedural limitation in § 2255 screens out a claim. For example, if an individual does not raise his legal innocence claim in a § 2255 motion in a timely fashion, see § 2255(f), he cannot resort to the saving clause to file a habeas petition, that individual did have a meaningful opportunity to raise his claim pursuant to the § 2255 process, but missed the window of opportunity. Similarly, where Congress has clearly narrowed the scope of postconviction relief—as it has done for claims of new evidence and new constitutional rules—it has overridden the equivalence aim that would otherwise render § 2255 inadequate or ineffective, such that the saving clause does not apply. On top of this, given the congruence purpose underlying § 2255(e), an individual can resort to habeas via § 2255(e) only where the particular claim he seeks to bring would have been cognizable under pre-AEDPA principles.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,137,"Thus, the majority has no good answer to interpreting the saving clause as doing what Congress crafted it to do—among other things, ensuring equivalence between § 2255 and the prior postconviction remedy being replaced or modified, unless Congress clearly establishes otherwise. A successive statutory innocence claim could have been brought prior to the 1996 addition of § 2255(h), and Congress has not clearly foreclosed such claims in the text of § 2255. Therefore, the saving clause applies, and Jones should have been permitted to raise his legal innocence claim by filing a habeas petition under § 2241.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,139,"The foregoing analysis assumes, as the majority does, that the only hope of a prisoner in Jones's position is to assert his statutory innocence claim via a habeas petition filed under § 2241 per the saving clause, because § 2255(h) prevents the filing of such a successive § 2255 motion. But I would not be so quick to assume that a successive § 2255 motion asserting statutory innocence is impermissible due to § 2255(h). Here is why.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,140,"Nothing in the whole of § 2255 suggests that Congress ever considered the scenario presented in this case—one in which a prisoner who has already filed a postconviction motion suddenly gets a new claim of legal innocence (after his first petition was filed) based on a development in Supreme Court case law. Therefore, it is not at all clear that Congress determined that such an individual is simply out of luck. Far from making the decision that a prisoner in this circumstance should not be permitted to raise that newly available claim by filing another § 2255 motion—as the majority maintains—Congress has simply never spoken to what is supposed to happen with newly available claims of legal innocence.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,141,"To reach today's conclusion, then, the majority draws a negative inference that Congress intended for § 2255's second or successive bar to preclude successive filings that contain legal innocence claims. Ante, at 1868. But the majority's inferential reasoning is highly problematic in at least two respects.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,142,"First, negative inferences drawn without proper context can be notoriously unreliable. And, as detailed below, there are myriad reasons for skepticism here. Section 2255(h)'s anti-claim-splitting purpose is one. Another is the likely reason that legal innocence claims do not appear in the text of the statute (spoiler alert: they were inadvertently omitted). Background equitable principles and the practical consequences of preventing the filing of successive petitions in this circumstance are  additional key contextual clues that the majority seems to have missed.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,143,"Second, I am suspicious of the majority's choice to resort to inferential reasoning at all, given that this Court has long held that we will not read a statute to displace access to the great writ unless Congress has been clear about its intention to accomplish this result. Ex parte Yerger, 75 U.S. 85, 8 Wall. 85, 95, 102, 19 L.Ed. 332 (1869). The clear-statement rule is plainly applicable here, and the majority offers the flimsiest of explanations for its decision to deviate from its application at the threshold of today's interpretation.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,144,"In short, as shown below, the initial assumption that Congress necessarily meant for § 2255(h) to bar Jones's successive petition asserting statutory innocence is shaky, at best. I would have held that Jones's petition can proceed, even without reliance on the saving clause, because § 2255(h) does not bar it.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,146,"The majority says that since AEDPA, second or successive § 2255 motions are barred unless they rely on one of two (and only two) circumstances: `newly discovered evidence,' § 2255(h)(1), or `a new rule of constitutional law,' § 2255(h)(2). Ante, at 1863. Legal innocence claims are barred, the majority holds, pursuant to this straightforward negative inference. Ante, at 1868. But there is a good reason that the negative-inference canon must be applied with great caution. A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 107 (2012). And the reason is that its application depends so much on context. Ibid. In this case, for instance, there are several strong contextual clues that substantially undercut the majority's purportedly straightforward inferential reasoning.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,148,"First of all, while the majority interprets § 2255(h) as if Congress designed that provision to impose finality without regard to the claims at issue (other than the two listed situations), see ante, at 1869-1870, as it turns out, that is not the primary purpose of § 2255(h). Instead, § 2255(h)'s second or successive petition bar was inserted into AEDPA to ensure that all available claims a prisoner has are brought in a single postconviction petition. In circumstances where the prisoner seeks to assert a claim that was previously unavailable (i.e., a claim that could not have been raised before), Congress permitted successive petitions.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,149,"Explaining this fully requires me to make a preliminary big-picture point. Section 2255 (originally and as amended by AEDPA) is not a gauntlet of arbitrary hurdles that Congress has erected to stymie prisoners who seek to obtain judicial review of their detention. Indeed, as explained, when Congress first enacted § 2255, it had no intention of shrinking the catalog of available postconviction claims. Ante, at 1865-1866, see also Part I, supra. To be sure, Congress has undertaken to restrict the writ's availability somewhat since § 2255 was first enacted, but it has nevertheless continued to appreciate the significance of access to postconviction review of the legality of a prisoner's detention. Hence, even after AEDPA, Congress permits all incarcerated individuals—including those who have been convicted of serious crimes and who are serving sentences that have been imposed by courts of competent jurisdiction—to seek collateral relief. See §§ 2254(a), 2255(a).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,150,"Still, when it enacted AEDPA in 1996, Congress was aware of how § 2255's postconviction processes had been operating on the ground since § 2255's enactment. Thus, Congress quite rationally sought to  `balance' the `individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case' with `the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources.' McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 393, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013) (quoting Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995)).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,151,"Section 2255(h) reflects this balancing. What emerges from a review of the debates over the successive petition restrictions is a clear sense that Congress wanted to prevent manipulation of the system through relitigation of previously presented claims or strategic withholding of claims for later presentation, while still creating a mechanism that would allow prisoners to have one full, fair chance to present their meritorious  claims to the federal courts. B. Stevenson, The Politics of Fear and Death: Successive Problems in Capital Federal Habeas Corpus Cases, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 699, 772 (2002). As Senator Hatch said at the time: We have provided for protection of Federal habeas corpus, but we do it one time and that is it—unless, of course, they can truly come up with evidence of innocence that could not have been presented at trial. There we allow successive petitions. 141 Cong. Rec. 15042 (1995). Then-Senator Biden similarly explained that the goal of AEDPA was essentially giving one bite out of the apple to drastically reduce the ability to have successive petitions unless there is some egregious action that is learned about after the petition is filed, the first petition. Id., at 15027.7",Jackson,0,
2022-012,152,"Thus, Congress enacted § 2255(h) to prevent prisoners from engaging in manipulative filing practices—such as claim splitting, i.e., the inefficient business of prisoners with time on their hands doling out their existing postconviction claims in a series of successive motions filed in court seriatim. See Sanders, 373 U.S. at 18, 83 S.Ct. 1068 (noting that a prisoner may deliberately withhold or deliberately abandon claims in a first postconviction petition in the hope of being granted two hearings rather than one).8 And, tellingly, because Congress was focused on that problem—not attempting to impose finality writ large—it did not bar all successive petitions, to the contrary, it proceeded to identify particular circumstances in which another collateral challenge would be authorized. §§ 2255(h)(1)-(2).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,153,"Additional doubts about the majority's negative inference surface when one recognizes that the two circumstances Congress carved out of the successive-petition bar share an important common thread: Both situations relate to the newness of the claim that the prisoner seeks to assert in a successive petition. That is, both prongs of § 2255(h) that authorize a successive petition do so where a petitioner brings a claim that arose after the time in which the prisoner would or could have filed his first petition. Ibid. (authorizing successive petitions raising newly discovered evidence  or a new rule of constitutional law (emphasis added)).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,154,"In light of this key observation, the majority's assumption that § 2255(h) bars Jones's claim is significantly hobbled. Jones's statutory innocence claim is also new—in the sense that it was not available to him when his first § 2255 petition was filed.9 And Jones's claim shares other features of the circumstances that Congress exempted from the second or successive general prohibition as well—including that it implicates innocence, see § 2255(h)(1), and stems from a retroactively applicable Supreme Court opinion, see § 2255(h)(2). Nor does the filing of Jones's successive petition implicate any anti-claim-splitting rationale, as Jones did not manipulatively withhold his legal innocence claim during his initial § 2255 proceedings. Indeed, he could not possibly have done so, since this Court did not decide Rehaif v. United States, 588 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 2191, 204 L.Ed.2d 594 (2019), which provided the basis for his claim, until nearly two decades after Jones filed his first petition.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,155,"In short, it is hard to believe that a Congress that expressly authorized new claims involving innocence or those that arise from developments in Supreme Court case law despite § 2255(h)'s successive-petition bar also meant for § 2255(h) to preclude Jones from bringing the claim that he seeks to file here.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,157,"The majority's negative inference also rests on the bald assumption that Congress intentionally left statutory innocence out of its list of carveouts, because it wanted those claims to be barred if brought in a successive petition. Ante, at 1869-1870 (asserting that Congress has chosen finality over error correction with respect to statutory innocence claims brought in successive petitions (emphasis added)). But there is a perfectly logical alternative explanation for why statutory innocence claims do not appear as express exclusions in the text of § 2255(h), an explanation that is based on another important contextual reference point: the enactment history of the statute.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,158,"Section 2255(h) was enacted in the same Public Law as § 2244(b), a provision that contains analogous second-or-successive petition limitations for state prisoners. Indeed, Congress appears to have modeled § 2255(h)(2) on those state-prisoner provisions. Chazen v. Marske, 938 F.3d 851, 863 (CA7 2019) (BARRETT, J., concurring) (citing R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1362 (7th ed. 2015) (Hart & Wechsler)). Like § 2255(h), § 2244(b)—the model provision—does not address statutory innocence claims in any fashion. But that is simply because there is no such thing as a statutory innocence claim in the realm of federal collateral relief for state prisoners. See Hart & Wechsler 1362, see also Estelle  v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (Federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,159,"Thus, as others have observed, when Congress crafted § 2255(h) based on the state-prisoner model in § 2244(b), it seems to have `lost sight of the fact that' federally incarcerated individuals `can raise federal statutory claims in their collateral attacks.' Chazen, 938 F.3d at 863 (quoting Hart & Wechsler 1362, emphasis added), Chazen, 938 F.3d at 863 (suggesting that the omission of legal innocence claims from § 2255(h) was due to congressional oversight), Reply Brief for Respondent 15.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,160,"To me, this contextual revelation rocks the foundation of the majority's negative inference. That is, it is plausible (and perhaps even likely) that Congress did not appreciate fully that the modeled-after language establishing a successive-petition bar did not capture the full scope of available claims for federal prisoners.10 And, of course, if Congress simply overlooked statutory innocence claims when it crafted § 2255(h), then the omitted language that the majority puts so much stock in is not actually indicative of Congress having chosen finality with respect to statutory innocence claims. Ante, at 1869-1870. Instead, the absence of any textual reference to statutory innocence would be wholly unremarkable.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,162,"Given the purpose and history of § 2255(h) as I have just described them, I find quite compelling the Government's observation that nothing in AEDPA actually justifies an inference that Congress silently repealed the traditional postconviction remedy for federal prisoners who have been imprisoned for conduct that Congress did not criminalize. Brief for Respondent 28. I proceed here to add that nothing outside of AEDPA—not the background legal principles that existed at the time Congress enacted the statute, nor the practical consequences of reading § 2255(h) in this manner—supports that inference either.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,163,"Take equity, for instance. When Congress crafted § 2255(h), it legislated against an important background equitable principle pertaining to postconviction relief: Courts should not interpret statutory provisions governing habeas review to even `run the risk' of causing prisoners to `forever lose their opportunity for any federal review of their  claims.' Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 945-946, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007) (quoting Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 275, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005)), see also Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637, 645, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998). This means that Congress was well aware that courts consistently rely on equitable doctrines to carve out  ways petitioners can bypass otherwise applicable procedural obstacles  when a prisoner has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their federal claims. E. Primus, Equitable Gateways: Toward Expanded Federal Habeas Corpus Review of State-Court Criminal Convictions, 61 Ariz. L. Rev. 291, 305 (2019).11 Knowing that courts are equitable tribunals that tend to operate in this fashion should have prompted Congress to express its intention to override that value (assuming that it actually intended to completely foreclose new legal innocence claims). Congress did not do so, yet the majority reads its silence to accomplish that same extraordinarily inequitable result.12",Jackson,0,
2022-012,164,"The practical consequences that inure from the majority's reading also undercut substantially the negative inference upon which the majority relies. We have consistently warned that courts should resist an interpretation of AEDPA that would `produce troublesome results' and `create procedural anomalies.' Panetti, 551 U.S. at 946, 127 S.Ct. 2842 (quoting Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 380, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003)). The majority does not speak to this at all, but its interpretation of § 2255 produces bizarre outcomes.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,165,"First, there is the quirky procedural anomaly that arises due to the fact that statutory innocence claims are fully authorized in the postconviction review context. This Court's recognition that a statute covers a narrower scope of criminal conduct than was previously acknowledged falls within the narrow subset of criminal law decisions that are fully retroactive, meaning that a federal prisoner can rely upon that new determination whether his case is still on direct review or not. Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 351-352, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004), Bousley, 523 U.S. at 620-621, 118 S.Ct. 1604. But reading § 2255(h) to bar a successive petition raising legal innocence would mean that most prisoners who would (remarkably) be eligible for such retroactive relief would turn out to have no mechanism for actually requesting it. A strange practical conundrum, to say the least.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,166,"Inferring that § 2255(h) bars legal innocence claims when brought in a successive petition also produces stunningly disparate results that bear no relationship to Congress's purported finality goals. Consider two individuals who have been convicted of the same federal crime—perhaps two codefendants who were tried and sentenced together. Both complete their direct appeals, but only one files a § 2255 motion within AEDPA's statute of limitations, while the other one decides not to or misses the deadline. If § 2255(h) bars a successive petition raising a legal innocence claim, then when Rehaif is handed down— altering the elements of the crime of conviction such that both prisoners have a colorable claim of legal innocence—only the one who did not previously file a § 2255 petition can raise this retroactive statutory innocence claim.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,167,"Reference to Congress's interest in finality cannot explain this odd unequal treatment. Under the Court's interpretation, a prisoner whose conviction became final 30 years ago can assert a Rehaif claim if he never previously filed a § 2255 motion, whereas someone whose conviction became final 2 years ago cannot if he has already had a § 2255 petition adjudicated.13",Jackson,0,
2022-012,168,"Interpreting § 2255(h) as completely foreclosing successive petitions bringing statutory innocence claims also places prisoners in an untenable catch-22 that cannot be what any rational Congress actually intended. Consider what has happened in this very case. Per AEDPA's statute of limitations, Jones had to file his first § 2255 petition within one year of his conviction becoming final. § 2255(f). He did so, and that petition was successful, the Eighth Circuit found that Jones had received ineffective assistance of counsel. United States v. Jones, 403 F.3d 604, 605 (2005). In the majority's view, by seeking to vindicate his Sixth Amendment rights in this way, Jones has forfeited, forever and for all time, his right to rely on any new retroactive Supreme Court opinion that suggests he is incarcerated for noncriminal behavior. There is no indication that Congress meant for Jones and other prisoners in his position to have to choose between pursing an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel. claim and a claim of legal innocence.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-012,169,"Despite all this, the majority clings to its straightforward negative inference and interprets § 2255(h) as a bar to a court's consideration of Jones's legal innocence claim. My point is that, with so many contextual indicators that Congress did not really mean for § 2255(h) to be read to preclude new claims of statutory innocence, the Court should have simply determined that Jones's petition, which asserts such a claim, was not plainly barred by § 2255(h), and could thus proceed in a successive § 2255 petition.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,171,"Instead of drawing an inference about the operation of § 2255(h), the most straightforward way of determining whether Jones's legal innocence claim is precluded by statute, ante, at 1869-1870, would have been to apply our clear-statement rule to today's interpretation.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,173,"A longstanding rule of this Court, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the clear-statement rule directs that, before interpreting a congressional enactment as `closing the Court's doors to a class of habeas petitioners,' the Court must search for a `clear indication that such was Congress' intent,' Panetti, 551 U.S. at 946, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (quoting Castro, 540 U.S. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778). This principle recognizes that Congress must speak unambiguously when it seeks to effect a result that, although constitutional, would undermine a constitutionally derived value. J. Manning, Textualism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 121-122 (2001) (Manning). And, before today, this Court has repeatedly recognized the importance of the clear-statement rule with respect to any analysis of an Act of Congress that potentially restricts access to the writ of habeas corpus or its statutory  equivalent.14 In fact, where a provision precluding review is claimed to bar habeas review, we have required a particularly clear statement. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 517, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003) (emphasis added).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,174,"The clear-statement rule is plainly implicated here. Under the state of the law at the time AEDPA was enacted, prisoners were entitled to bring a petition to assert a new claim of legal innocence, even a second or successive petition. Supra, at 1881-1882. Congress could change that state of affairs, but, under the clear-statement rule, if it intended to do so, it needed to speak clearly to effectuate that result.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,175,"At a more general level of analysis, the clear-statement rule also applies to these circumstances because the interpretive question in this case touches upon the venerated writ of habeas corpus—the only writ that is expressly mentioned in the Constitution. Art. I, § 9, cl. 2, Holland, 560 U.S. at 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549. We have long recognized that the clear-statement rule serves the core liberty interests protected by the writ of habeas corpus. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. at 103 (holding, more than 150 years ago, that the Court had jurisdiction over a particular habeas petition and relying on the clear-statement rule to reach that conclusion, explaining that, to conclude otherwise, would greatly weaken the efficacy of the writ and deprive the citizen in many cases of its benefits). Likewise, in modern times, we have been especially careful to reference clear-statement principles, and thereby eschew statutory interpretations that would (perhaps unintentionally) foreclose judicial review of postconviction claims, even where the text of the statute might (sometimes even strongly) suggest otherwise.15",Jackson,0,
2022-012,176,"Furthermore, and significantly for present purposes, we have already determined that the necessary clear statement here—i.e., the signal from Congress that justifies reading a statute as foreclosing  access to venerated postconviction review processes—cannot be derived from negative inferences drawn from statutory text. In Ex parte Yerger, for instance, we declared that interpreting a statute to repeal by implication habeas jurisdiction is not favored. 8 Wall. at 105. More recently, we warned (again) that implications from statutory text or legislative history are not sufficient to repeal habeas jurisdiction, instead, Congress must articulate specific and unambiguous statutory directives to effect a repeal. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 299, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (citing Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. at 105). And, again, in Holland, this Court explained that the clear-statement rule generally prohibits a court from inferring that the inclusion of one item  is to exclude other similar items in order to read a statute as forbidding review of a postconviction claim. 560 U.S. at 648, 130 S.Ct. 2549, see also id., at 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549 (counseling hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA's statutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to close courthouse doors). Yet, here, as the majority appears to admit, the only way to read § 2255(h) as barring Jones's statutory innocence claim is to infer that such preclusion is what Congress intended. Ante, at 1868, 1875-1876.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,177,"This case would have been easily resolved if we had applied the clear-statement rule at the outset, as we have always done in cases of this nature. Doing so would have appropriately eliminated a reading of § 2255(h) that forecloses access to habeas relief by negative implication. Use of the rule would have thus protected core constitutional norms by ensuring Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation. Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119, 139, 125 S.Ct. 2169, 162 L.Ed.2d 97 (2005) (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), see also Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,179,"In the last few pages of its opinion, the Court makes the unceremonious (but still startling) announcement that the clear-statement rule is inapplicable to today's analysis of § 2255(h). Ante, at 1875-1877.16 Try as it might, in my view, the majority has failed to provide a single persuasive reason for this dramatic break.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,180,"First, the majority suggests that the clear-statement rule is not appropriate when interpreting provisions related to finality —and seems to draw a line between AEDPA's statute of limitations, which does get clear-statement treatment, and its provisions governing successive petitions. Ante, at 1875-1877. This is nonsense. Both AEDPA provisions use similar language. § 2255(f) (A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section), § 2255(h) (A second or successive motion must  contain ). And both procedural limitations relate to Congress's interest in finality. Ante, at 1876-1877, Wood v. Milyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472, 132 S.Ct. 1826, 182 L.Ed.2d 733 (2012) (noting that AEDPA's statute of limitations lends finality to  court judgments within a reasonable time (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted)).17  Next, the majority conspicuously downplays the stakes in this case. Not once does its opinion make direct mention of the fact that the claim the majority says § 2255(h) silently precludes is one that implicates core values because it involves legal innocence. Instead, the majority repeatedly describes Jones's bid for access to the postconviction review process as bringing a mere statutory claim. Ante, at 1863-1864, 1869-1870, 1874, 1875-1876.18 But statutory claims that suggest a person's innocence are different in kind from more run-of-the-mill statutory claims, such as a technical, nonprejudicial violation of a criminal procedure rule. See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 186-187, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979), Davis, 417 U.S. at 346-347, 94 S.Ct. 2298 (citing Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428-429, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962)). In any event, the majority does not cite a single case that suggests that an Act of Congress that threatens to cut off access to habeas (or its statutory equivalent) should be treated any differently for purposes of application of the clear-statement rule if a petitioner's claim has a statutory basis.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,181,"The majority's most full-throated defense of its jettisoning of clear-statement principles lies in its attempt to cast statutory innocence claims as not historically or constitutionally grounded. Ante, at 1876. The first and most obvious problem with this effort is that the historical pedigree of a claim is irrelevant for clear-statement purposes. The clear-statement rule is applicable here because the statute being interpreted involves access to the writ of habeas corpus—a significant constitutional value that we would not assume Congress would discard without careful consideration. See Manning 121-122, see also Holland, 560 U.S. at 646-649, 130 S.Ct. 2549. And, so triggered, our clear-statement canon of construction is not rendered inapplicable just because the particular type of claim that a prisoner seeks to advance in the context of a habeas or postconviction proceeding (if he is afforded one) might not date back to the founding era. This must be why the majority cites no precedent that splices the clear-statement rule in this fashion.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,182,"Looking back to the time of the founding to determine whether the clear-statement rule applies to our interpretation of a statute passed in 1996 also makes no sense. The clear-statement question relates to what Congress intended with respect to the meaning of the statute at the time it was enacted. When Congress introduced § 2255(h), it codified or changed the law that existed at that time (i.e., in 1996). See, e.g., Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (noting that AEDPA's certificate-of-appealability provisions codified the prevailing judicial standard). Thus, when this Court has previously applied the clear-statement rule and analyzed the meaning of particular AEDPA provisions, the feelings of the Framers were of no moment.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,183,"Instead, we properly examined the law leading up to AEDPA's enactment, not founding-era sources. See, e.g., Panetti, 551 U.S. at 944, 127 S.Ct. 2842, Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 337, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010) (plurality opinion).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,184,"Even if the majority was right with respect to its assumption that founding-era practices bear on whether the clear-statement rule applies here, historical practice plainly undermines its assertion that legal innocence claims are of recent vintage. Supreme Court Justices riding circuit in the early 19th century repeatedly considered the merits of habeas petitions filed by individuals who argued they were being wrongfully incarcerated because the laws that had been invoked to justify their confinement, properly construed, did not reach their conduct.19 Moreover, and importantly, since the mid-19th century, the statutory scheme for postconviction review has permitted petitions based not only on a violation of the constitution but also on a violation of the  law of the United States. Judiciary Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, § 1, 14 Stat. 385, see also § 2255, W. Church, Writ of Habeas Corpus § 169, p. 249 (2d ed. 1893) (The issue raised on the hearing of a habeas corpus may be one of law simply).20",Jackson,0,
2022-012,185,"To the extent the majority's assessment of the purportedly nascent nature of statutory  innocence claims rests on its view that, at the time of the founding, habeas relief was rarely available when a petition was brought by a convicted individual (as opposed to a pretrial detainee), ante, at 1871-1874, there are two additional problems. For one thing, even assuming that a detainee-versus-convict scope-of-habeas distinction existed at the dawn of our Nation, Congress has now squarely rejected it.21 However grounded in history and tradition the Court's own view of the scope of habeas might be, it is obviously not shared by the Legislature that enacted the statute we are now interpreting.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,186,"Second, here again, the majority evaluates the historical pedigree of legal innocence claims based on faulty history. It maintains that, historically, a court could review a habeas petition filed by a convicted individual only for jurisdictional errors (which the majority defines narrowly). Ante, at 1871-1873, 1876-1877, cf. Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct. 1547, 1552-56 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., concurring). But those who have researched this contention have called it narrative and myth but not history. L. Kovarsky, Habeas Myths, Past and Present, 101 Texas L. Rev. Online 57, 79 (2022) (Kovarsky), see also J. Siegel, Habeas, History, and Hermeneutics, 64 Ariz. L. Rev. 505, 524-532 (2022) (Siegel), Brown v.

2022-012,187,"At the very least, this take on early habeas practice appears contradicted by United States v. Bainbridge, 24 F.Cas. 946 (No. 14,497) (CC Mass. 1816) (STORY, J.). There, Justice Story considered a statutory innocence claim on the merits even though the individual had already pleaded guilty. Id., at 949, 951-952. And the postconviction/preconviction distinction also runs headlong into other precedents that have looked back on history and do not subscribe to such a narrow view. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 302, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (The issuance of the writ was not limited to challenges to the jurisdiction of the custodian), Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 404, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963) (Nor is it true that at common law habeas corpus was available only to inquire into the jurisdiction, in a narrow sense, of the committing court (citing Bushell's Case, Vaughn. 135, 124 Eng. Rep. 1006 (C. P. 1670))).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,188,"Thus, assuming, arguendo, that the historical grounding of the particular type of claim Jones sought to bring even matters, the majority is mistaken when it contends that a statutory innocence claim (including one brought in a successive petition) is not  sufficiently historical to warrant application of our clear-statement rule.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-012,189,"If the majority had applied the clear-statement rule, as it should have, to determine whether § 2255(h) precludes successive postconviction petitions that assert statutory innocence claims, today's interpretive task would have merely involved answering one simple question: Is there an unambiguous sign in the text of § 2255 that Congress meant for § 2255(h) to strip an incarcerated individual of any opportunity to raise a new claim of legal innocence in a motion brought in federal court? No such sign exists.23 Therefore, we could have (and should have) easily concluded that there is no statutory impediment to Jones's § 2255 motion being entertained by a court.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,191,"Finally, I believe that the canon of constitutional avoidance also does important work to guide—and constrain—the Court's interpretation of § 2255 in this case. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), cf. Pressley, 430 U.S. at 381-382, 97 S.Ct. 1224 (relying on the saving clause to conclude that the District of Columbia's postconviction statute, which mirrored § 2255, was constitutional). The majority's bottom line, reading the interplay between § 2255(h) and § 2255(e), ante, at 1863, is that a person in prison for noncriminal conduct cannot ask a federal court to review the legality of his detention if he has previously filed a § 2255 petition. This position is stunning in a country where liberty is a constitutional guarantee and the courts are supposed to be dispensing justice. It also raises hackles under at least two provisions of our founding charter.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,192,"First, the Eighth Amendment. There is a nonfrivolous argument that the Constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the incarceration of innocent individuals. See In re Davis, 557 U.S. 952, 953, 130 S.Ct. 1, 174 L.Ed.2d 614 (2009) (STEVENS, J., concurring) (citing Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 377-380 (CA2 1997)), see also Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 432, n. 2, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting) (It  may violate the Eighth Amendment to imprison someone who is actually innocent), Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 667, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). This is not to say that the Eighth Amendment creates a freestanding entitlement to a second or successive round of postconviction review. Ante, at 1874. But here Jones seeks a single meaningful opportunity to have a federal court consider his claim of legal innocence.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,193,"The majority's interpretation also implicates the Suspension Clause. Art. I, § 9, cl. 2. The majority admits that, at a minimum, the Suspension Clause protects the right of habeas corpus as it existed at the time of the founding.24 See ante, at 1871. The  majority also seems to acknowledge that, in the late 18th century, an individual— even one who had been convicted of a crime—could invoke habeas to raise a jurisdictional error. Ante, at 1871, 1876-1877. Historically, the term `jurisdictional' when used by habeas courts meant something much broader then than it means now. Kovarsky 75, see also Siegel 524. And, importantly, a court lacked jurisdiction —and thus the writ could issue —when a person was incarcerated for noncriminal behavior.25",Jackson,0,
2022-012,194,"Thus, it appears that, by its own lights, the majority today renders an interpretation of § 2255 that has potentially significant constitutional implications.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,196,"I conclude with an observation. Today's ruling follows a recent series of troubling AEDPA interpretations.26 All of these opinions have now collectively managed to transform a statute that Congress designed to provide for a rational and orderly process of federal postconviction judicial review into an aimless and chaotic exercise in futility. The route to obtaining collateral relief is presently replete with imagined artificial barriers, arbitrary dead ends, and traps for the unwary. And today's turn makes the journey palpably absurd: It begins with the Supreme Court's (rare) announcement that a certain claim for release  exists and is retroactively available to incarcerated individuals on collateral review, and ends with the realization that only an arbitrarily determined sliver of eligible prisoners (those who have not had the temerity to file a prior motion) are actually in a position to even ask a court to consider whether any such relief might be provided.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,197,"It is quite clear that the Court's rulings in this area of the law reflect a general ethos that convicted prisoners should not be permitted to file § 2255 motions or obtain postconviction relief at all. But what matters is what Congress wants with respect to the operation of the statutory provisions it enacts. And, as I have shown, Congress's aim in crafting § 2255 was to permit convicted prisoners to file postconviction motions asserting claims for collateral relief in a manner that also curbs abusive filings. Congress did not speak— one way or the other—as to what should happen if a prisoner who has previously filed a § 2255 motion gets a new claim of legal innocence due to an intervening change in the law.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,198,"Given Congress's silence on this matter, in my view, there is simply no justification for drawing a negative inference that Congress meant for § 2255 to operate in a manner that is patently inconsistent with the reasons it passed that statute, or the background principles that animated the law more broadly at the time of the statute's enactment, or even (possibly) core constitutional principles. Instead, § 2255(e) should be read—consistent with Congress's general intent to ensure equivalence between the claims available in habeas and those that its new postconviction mechanism allowed—to permit prisoners who have a new and retroactive statutory innocence claim to file a habeas petition in lieu of a § 2255 motion. Alternatively, we should honor Congress's clear interest in preserving a prisoner's ability to have one meaningful opportunity to have all of his claims presented to a court, by allowing Jones to file a petition asserting his new and retroactive claim of statutory innocence, notwithstanding what might otherwise be perceived as an ironclad bar in § 2255(h).",Jackson,0,
2022-012,199,"In other words, as I see it, the negative inference that the majority draws today rests on nothing—and certainly nothing that actually derives from Congress's intent. Nothing in the text of § 2255, background principles concerning habeas relief, or AEDPA's enactment history compels (or even supports) the conclusion that Congress intended to completely foreclose claims like Jones's. And it is especially perverse to read the statute to lead to that result when doing so gives rise to legally dissonant, arbitrary, and untenable outcomes. So, the majority's straightforward determination that this statute does preclude a prisoner in Jones's position from filing a successive petition to assert a legal innocence claim (which it reaches by refusing to follow the procedural norm that would have correctly framed the issue as a matter of congressional intent relative to clear-statement principles) appears to stem from the Court's own views concerning finality, not the will of Congress.",Jackson,0,
2022-012,200,"Ultimately, of course, this all begs the question of how (and whether) Congress will respond to the Court's systematic neutering of the balanced postconviction processes that the Legislature has established. It seems to me that today's opinion —which unjustifiably closes off all avenues for certain defendants to secure meaningful consideration of their innocence claims—creates an opening for Congress to step in and fix this problem.",Jackson,0,
2022-013,30,"The Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations require certain individuals to file annual reports with the federal government about their foreign bank accounts. The statute imposes a maximum $10,000 penalty for nonwillful violations of the law. But recently a question has arisen. Does someone who fails to file a timely or accurate annual report commit a single violation subject to a single $10,000 penalty? Or does that person commit separate violations and incur separate $10,000 penalties for each account not properly recorded within a single report?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,31,"The answer makes a difference, especially for immigrants who hold accounts abroad and Americans who make their lives outside the country. On one view, penalties accrue on a per-report basis. So, for example, a single late-filed report disclosing the existence of 10 accounts may yield a maximum fine of $10,000. On another view, penalties multiply on a per-account basis, so the same report can invite a fine of $100,000 even if the individual's foreign holdings or total net worth do not approach that amount. Because the Ninth Circuit read the law one way and the Fifth Circuit the other, we agreed to take this case.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,33,"The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) does not make it illegal to hold foreign accounts. Nor does the BSA tax those accounts. To the contrary, the federal government has acknowledged that U. S. persons maintain overseas financial accounts for a variety of legitimate reasons including convenience and access. IRS Pub. 5569, Report of Foreign Bank & Financial Accounts (FBAR) Reference Guide, p. 1 (Rev. 3-2022). As relevant here, the BSA simply requires those who possess foreign accounts with an aggregate balance of more than $10,000 to file an annual report on a  form known as an FBAR—the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. 31 U.S.C. § 5314, 31 C.F.R. § 1010.306 (2021).

FBAR Reference Guide, at 1.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,34,"The facts of the Ninth and Fifth Circuit cases help illuminate the particular question about the BSA now before us. The first dispute involved Jane Boyd, an American citizen who held 13 relevant accounts in the United Kingdom. The amounts in those accounts increased significantly after her father died in 2009 and she deposited her inheritance. United States v. Boyd, 991 F.3d 1077, 1079 (C.A.9 2021). Because the aggregate amount in Ms. Boyd's accounts exceeded $10,000 in 2009, she should have filed an FBAR in 2010. Neglecting to do so, she corrected the error in 2012, submitting a complete and accurate report at that time. Ibid. The government acknowledged that Ms. Boyd's violation of the law was non-willful. Still, the government said, it had the right to impose a $130,000 penalty —$10,000 for each of her 13 late-reported accounts. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,35,"Ms. Boyd challenged the penalty in court where she argued that her failure to file a single timely FBAR subjected her to a single maximum penalty of $10,000. The district court rejected that argument and sided with the government. United States v. Boyd, 123 A.F.T.R.2d XXXX-XXXX (C.D. Cal. 2019). But in time the Ninth Circuit vindicated Ms. Boyd's view, holding that the BSA authorizes only one non-willful penalty when an untimely, but accurate, FBAR is filed, no matter the number of accounts. 991 F.3d at 1078.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,36,"More recently, the same question arose in the Fifth Circuit in a case involving Alexandru Bittner. Born and raised in Romania, Mr. Bittner immigrated to the United States at a young age in 1982. He worked first as a dishwasher and later as a plumber and along the way became a naturalized citizen. After the fall of communism, Mr. Bittner returned to Romania in 1990 where he launched a successful business career. Like many dual citizens, he did not appreciate that U. S. law required him to keep the government apprised of his overseas financial accounts even while he lived abroad. 19 F.4th 734, 739-740 (C.A.5 2021). Shortly after returning to the United States in 2011, Mr. Bittner learned of his reporting obligations and engaged an accountant to help him prepare the required reports—covering five years, from 2007 through 2011. Id., at 739.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,37,"But the story did not end there. The government identified a problem in the late-filed reports. While those reports provided details about Mr. Bittner's largest account, they neglected to address 25 or more other accounts over which he had signatory authority or in which he had a qualifying interest. Ibid. After the government informed him of this deficiency, Mr. Bittner hired a new accountant who helped him file corrected FBARs for each year in question. Ibid. Under governing regulations, filers with signatory authority over or a qualifying interest in fewer than 25 accounts must provide details about each account, but individuals with 25 or more accounts need only check a box and disclose the total number of accounts. 31 C.F.R. § 1010.350(g). Instead of employing that expediency, however, Mr. Bittner and his new accountant volunteered details for each and every one of his accounts—61 accounts in 2007, 51 in 2008, 53 in 2009 and 2010, and 54 in 2011. 19 F.4th at 738.",Gorsuch,0,

2022-013,39,"Bittner's new filings. Nor did the government suggest that his previous errors were willful. But because the government took the view that nonwillful penalties apply to each account not accurately or timely reported, and because Mr. Bittner's late-filed reports for 2007-2011 collectively involved 272 accounts, the government thought a fine of $2.72 million was in order. Id., at 739-740.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,40,"Like Ms. Boyd before him, Mr. Bittner challenged his penalty in court, arguing that the BSA authorizes a maximum penalty for nonwillful violations of $10,000 per report, not $10,000 per account. As he put it, an individual's failure to file five reports in a timely manner might invite a penalty of $50,000, but it cannot support a penalty running into the millions. The district court agreed with Mr. Bittner's reading of the law, United States v. Bittner, 469 F.Supp.3d 709, 724-726 (E.D. Tex. 2020), but the Fifth Circuit upheld the government's assessment, 19 F.4th at 749.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,42,"With those facts in mind, the question before us boils down to this: Does the BSA's $10,000 penalty for nonwillful violations accrue on a per-report or a per-account basis? Mr. Bittner urges us to agree with the Ninth Circuit and hold that the law authorizes a single $10,000 fine for each untimely or inaccurate report. The government defends the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and asks us to hold that a new $10,000 penalty attaches to each account not timely or accurately disclosed within a report.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,44,"To resolve who has the better reading of the law, we begin with the terms of the most immediately relevant statutory provisions, 31 U.S.C. § 5314 and § 5321. The first delineates an individual's legal duties under the BSA, the second outlines the penalties that follow for failing to discharge those duties.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,45,"Section 5314 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall require certain persons to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file reports when they make a transaction or maintain a relation with a foreign financial agency. § 5314(a). When it comes to the duty to file reports, the relevant duty in our case, the statute says that reports shall contain information about the identity and address of participants in a transaction or relationship, the legal capacity in which a participant is acting, and the identity of real parties in interest, along with a description of the transaction. §§ 5314(a)(1)-(4). The law also directs the Secretary to prescribe the way and  the extent to which reports must be filed. § 5314(a).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,46,"Immediately, one thing becomes clear. Section 5314 does not speak of accounts or their number. The word account does not even appear. Instead, the relevant legal duty is the duty to file reports. Of course, those reports must include various kinds of information about an individual's foreign transactions or relationships. But whether a report is filed late, whether a timely report contains one mistake about the address of the participants in a transaction, or whether a report includes multiple willful errors in its description of transactions, the duty to supply a compliant report is violated. Put another way, the statutory obligation is binary. Either one files a report in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes, or one does not. Multiple willful errors about specific accounts in a single report may confirm a violation of § 5314, but even a single nonwillful mistake is enough to pose a problem. One way or another, § 5314 is violated. The only distinction the law  draws between these cases concerns the appropriate penalty.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,47,"That's where § 5321 comes in. As a baseline, § 5321(a)(5) authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for any violation of § 5314. 31 U.S.C. §§ 5321(a)(5)(A) and (B)(i). Some call this the nonwillful penalty provision. And here again, one thing is immediately apparent: The law still does not speak of accounts or their number. Instead, the statute pegs the quantity of nonwillful penalties to the quantity of violations. And as we have seen, § 5314 provides that a violation occurs when an individual fails to file a report consistent with the statute's commands. So multiple deficient reports may yield multiple $10,000 penalties, and even a seemingly simple deficiency in a single report may expose an individual to a $10,000 penalty. But in all cases, penalties for nonwillful violations accrue on a per-report, not a per-account, basis.1",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,48,"To be sure, the statute's penalty provisions do not stop there. Section 5321 goes on to say that if an individual willfully violates § 5314, he may face a maximum penalty of $100,000. § 5321(a)(5)(C)(i)(I). The statute then adds an even more specific rule for a subclass of willful violations— those that involve a failure to report the existence of an account or any identifying information required to be provided with respect to an account. § 5321(a)(5)(D)(ii). In cases like that, the law authorizes the Secretary to impose a maximum penalty of either $100,000 or 50% of the balance in the account at the time of the violation— whichever is greater. §§ 5321(a)(5)(C) and (D)(ii). So here, at last, the law does tailor penalties to accounts. But the statute does so only for a certain category of cases that involve willful violations, not for cases like ours that involve only nonwillful violations.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,49,"No surprise, the government seeks to turn this feature of the law to its advantage. Because Congress explicitly authorized per-account penalties for some willful violations, the government asks us to infer that Congress meant to do so for analogous nonwillful violations as well. Brief for United States 20-23. But, in truth, this line of reasoning cuts against the government. When Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it from a neighbor, we normally understand that difference in language to convey a difference in meaning (expressio unius est exclusio alterius). The government's interpretation defies this traditional rule of statutory construction. See, e.g., Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 391, 135 S.Ct. 913, 190 L.Ed.2d 771 (2015), Gallardo v. Marstiller, 596 U. S. ___, ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1751, 1758-1759, 1759-1760, 213 L.Ed.2d 1 (2022).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,50,"The government's problem repeats itself too. Section 5321(a)(5)(B)(ii) contains a reasonable cause exception. That exception allows an individual to escape a penalty (say for filing late) only if his violation was nonwillful, due to reasonable cause, and the report he eventually files accurately reflects each and every account.2 All of which supplies further evidence that, when Congress wished to tie sanctions to account-level information, it knew exactly how to do so. Congress said that penalties for certain willful violations may be measured on a per-account basis.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,51,"Congress said that a person may invoke the reasonable cause exception only on a showing of per-account accuracy. But the one thing Congress did not say is that the government may impose nonwillful penalties on a per-account basis. Conspicuously, the one place in the statute where the government needs per-account language to appear is the one place it does not. In the end, the government's per-account theory faces not just a single expressio unius challenge but two.3",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,52,"The dissent founders on the same shoals. It suggests that the pattern of account-specific language in the willful penalty provision and the reasonable cause exception connotes that the nonwillful penalty provision must operate on a per-account basis. Post, at 727, 729 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). But (again), just because two provisions in the law are similar does not mean we may ignore differences found in a third. Seeking a way around the problem, the dissent points to the fact that even a single qualifying foreign bank account triggers the duty to file a report, and the fact that a compliant report must contain a list of information about bank addresses and the like. Post, at 726-727. These features of the law, the dissent says, underscore that nonwillful violations accrue per account. Post, at 726. But that simply does not follow. The fact that a person has a duty to file a report, or provide certain information in a report, does not tell us whether penalties for non-willful violations accrue per report or multiply per account without regard to an individual's net worth or foreign holdings.4",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,54,"Widening our view beyond § 5314 and § 5321, we find other contextual clues pressing against the government's theory. Consider what the government itself has told the public about the BSA. In 2010, the Department of the Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking warning that, under its proposed rules, a person who is required to file an FBAR and fails to properly file may be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000. 75 Fed. Reg. 8854 (2010). Elsewhere, the government has told suspected FBAR violators that for the failure to file  the penalty cannot exceed $10,000. IRS, Letter 3709, p. 1 (Mar. 2011). Instructions included with the FBAR form have cautioned that a person who is required to file an FBAR and fails to properly file may be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000. IRS, Form TD F 90-22.1, p. 8 (Mar. 2011). An IRS Fact Sheet has advised that, for the FBAR, the penalty may be up to $10,000, if the failure to file is non-willful. IRS, Offshore Income and Filing Information for Taxpayers with Offshore Accounts, FS-2014-7 (June 2014). Ms. Boyd herself received a similarly  worded letter alerting her that `for the failure to file the FBAR  the penalty cannot exceed $10,000.' Boyd, 991 F.3d at 1085, n. 11 (alterations in original and emphasis deleted).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,55,"None of these representations about the law's operation fits easily with the government's current theory. In all of these warnings, fact sheets, and instructions, the government seemed to tell the public that the failure to file a report represents a single violation exposing a nonwillful violator to one $10,000 penalty. Nowhere in these materials did the government announce its current theory that a single deficient or untimely report can give rise to multiple violations, that the number of nonwillful penalties may turn on the number of accounts, or that the $10,000 maximum penalty may be multiplied 272 times or more without respect to an individual's foreign holdings or net worth.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,56,"Doubtless, the government's guidance documents do not control our analysis and cannot displace our independent obligation to interpret the law. But this Court has long said that courts may consider the consistency of an agency's views when we weigh the persuasiveness of any interpretation it proffers in court. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). Here, the government has repeatedly issued guidance to the public at odds with the interpretation it now asks us to adopt. And surely that counts as one more reason yet to question whether its current position represents the best view of the law.5",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,57,"The drafting history of the nonwillful penalty provision undermines the government's theory too. When Congress adopted the BSA in 1970, the law included penalties only for willful violations and capped them at $1,000. Pub. L. 91-508, § 125(a), 84 Stat. 1117. It took many years before Congress in 1986 authorized the government to impose penalties on a per-account basis for certain willful violations. Pub. L. 99-570, § 1357(c), 100 Stat. 3207-25. And it took many years more before Congress in 2004 amended the law again to authorize penalties for nonwillful violations. Pub. L. 108-357, § 821(a), 118 Stat. 1586. When crafting this latest provision, it would have been the simplest thing for Congress to model its work on its 1986 amendment and authorize per-account penalties for non-willful violations just as it had for certain willful ones. But Congress didn't do anything like that. The language it adopted for nonwillful penalties in 2004 bears scant resemblance to the language it used when authorizing per-account penalties for certain willful violations in 1986.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,58,"Consider as well Congress's statement of purpose. Congress has declared that the BSA's purpose is to require certain reports or records that may assist the government in everything from criminal and tax to intelligence and counterintelligence investigations. 31 U.S.C. § 5311.6 Here we see further evidence  that the relevant legal duty the BSA establishes is the duty to file certain reports. We see evidence, too, that the point of these reports is to supply the government with information potentially relevant to various kinds of investigations, criminal and civil alike. But what we do not see is any indication that Congress sought to maximize penalties for every nonwillful mistake (whether a late filing, a transposed account number, or an out-of-date bank address). See Brief for American College of Trust and Estate Counsel as Amicus Curiae 5-7.7",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,59,"The Secretary's regulations implementing the BSA convey the same message. Under those regulations, individuals with fewer than 25 accounts must provide details about each account while those (like Mr. Bittner) with 25 or more accounts do not need to list each one or provide account-specific details about any of them. 31 C.F.R. § 1010.350(g)(1). Instead, filers with 25 or more accounts need only provide the number of financial accounts and certain other basic information. Ibid. Naturally, an individual must supply more detailed information if the Secretary or his delegate later chooses to follow up and request it. Ibid. But no detailed account-level information is required in the filer's initial report. It's yet another feature of the BSA and its regulatory scheme that suggests the law aims to provide the government with a report sufficient to tip it to the need for further investigation, not to ensure the presentation of every detail or maximize revenue for each mistake.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,60,"The Secretary's regulation also points to some of the anomalies that accompany the government's per-account theory. On the government's telling, an individual with, say, three accounts who makes nonwillful errors when providing details about these accounts faces a potential penalty of $30,000. He faces that penalty no matter how slight his errors, and regardless whether his foreign holdings (or even net worth) approach the same amount. Meanwhile, a person with 300 bank accounts runs far less risk of incurring any penalty. He doesn't have to provide any detail about his accounts, just correctly disclose how many he holds. See also Brief for American College of Tax Counsel as Amicus Curiae 15-16 (Brief for Tax Counsel).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,61,"Nor is this the only incongruity the government's theory invites. Consider someone who has a $10 million balance in a single account who nonwillfully fails to report that account. Everyone agrees he is subject to a single penalty of $10,000. Yet under the government's theory, another person engaging in the same nonwillful conduct with respect to a dozen foreign accounts with an aggregate balance of $10,001 would be subject to a penalty of $120,000. Id., at 14-15.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,62,"On the government's view, too, those who willfully violate the law may face lower penalties than those who violate the law nonwillfully. For example, an individual who holds $1 million in a foreign account during the course of a year but  withdraws it before the filing deadline and then willfully fails to file an FBAR faces a maximum penalty of $100,000. But a person who errs nonwillfully in listing 20 accounts with an aggregate balance of $50,000 can face a penalty of up to $200,000. Id., at 14. Reading the law to apply nonwillful penalties per report invites none of these curiosities, the government's per-account theory invites them all.8",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,63,"The government does not dispute any of this but replies that the per-report interpretation risks an anomaly of its own. After all, the government observes, the BSA affords the Secretary considerable discretion in formulating reporting requirements. So much so, the government contends, that the Secretary could require a separate report for each account and in that way effectively achieve a per-account penalty for nonwillful violations. Brief for United States 32. But what does this prove? Assuming the Secretary could require more frequent reports (a question not before us), that would mean the Secretary could also require less frequent reports (for example, every other year). Likewise, the Secretary could reduce the amount of information required in those reports (say, expanding the tick-box option to all filers, not just those with 25 or more accounts). Perhaps more fundamentally, whether the Secretary may lawfully ordain more or fewer reports does nothing to answer the question whether the Secretary may impose nonwillful penalties on a per-report or per-account basis. That question would still remain. Reply Brief 7-8.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,65,"To the extent doubt persists at this point about the best reading of the BSA, a venerable principle supplies a way to resolve it. Under the rule of lenity, this Court has long held, statutes imposing penalties are to be construed strictly against the government and in favor of individuals. Commissioner v. Acker, 361 U.S. 87, 91, 80 S.Ct. 144, 4 L.Ed.2d 127 (1959). Following that rule here requires us to favor a per-report approach that would restrain BSA penalties over a per-account theory that would greatly enhance them.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,66,"The government resists this conclusion by seeking to distinguish Acker. That case involved a penalty provision in the Internal Revenue Code, the government emphasizes, while this case involves a penalty provision in the BSA. Brief for United States 44-45. But that distinction makes no difference. The rule of lenity is not shackled to the Internal Revenue Code or any other chapter of federal statutory law. Instead, as Acker acknowledged, the law is settled that penal statutes are to be construed strictly, and an individual is not to be subjected to a penalty unless the words of the statute plainly impose it. 361 U.S. at 91, 80 S.Ct. 144 (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added). Notably, too, Acker cited to and relied on cases applying this same principle to penalty provisions under a wide array of statutes, including the Communications Act of 1934, a bankruptcy law, and the National Banking Act. See ibid. (citing FCC v. American Broadcasting Co., 347 U.S. 284, 296, 74 S.Ct. 593, 98 L.Ed. 699 (1954), Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, 197 U.S. 356, 362, 25 S.Ct. 443, 49 L.Ed. 790 (1905), and Tiffany v. National Bank of Mo., 18  Wall. 409, 410, 21 L.Ed. 862 (1874)), see also Scalia & Garner at 297 (the rule of lenity applies to civil penalties).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,67,"Two additional features of this case make it a particularly appropriate candidate for the rule of lenity. First, the rule exists in part to protect the Due Process Clause's promise that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931), see also Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 393, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926), Wooden v. United States, 595 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct. 1063, 1081-1084, 212 L.Ed.2d 187 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment). And the government's current theory poses a serious fair-notice problem. The relevant provisions of the BSA nowhere discuss per-account penalties for nonwillful violations. A number of the government's own public guidance documents have seemingly warned of per-report, not per-account, penalties for non-willful violations. See Part II-B, supra, Brief for Tax Counsel 6-24. We are even told that, until 2008 and 2009, when the government began aggressively enforcing FBAR penalties, many experienced tax professionals and return preparers were not aware of the FBAR reporting obligations, let alone aware of the government's current theory about the scope of penalties for non-willful violations. Brief for Center for Taxpayer Rights as Amicus Curiae 24, 20-28, and n. 21. If many experienced accountants were unable to anticipate the government's current theory, we do not see how the common world had fair notice of it. McBoyle, 283 U.S. at 27, 51 S.Ct. 340.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,68,"Second, the question before us has criminal as well as civil ramifications. Section 5321 outlines civil penalties for nonwillful and willful violations of the BSA. Next door, § 5322 provides criminal sanctions for willfully violating the Act. The term violation or violating is a constant between these two provisions. Accordingly, if the government were right that violations accrue on a per-account rather than a per-report basis under § 5321, the same rule would apply under § 5322. Each willfully misstated or late-reported account, rather than each deficient or late-filed report, would give rise to a separate criminal violation carrying the possibility of a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. In a case like Mr. Bittner's, involving 5 reports and 272 accounts, that would mean a person who willfully violates the BSA could face a $68 million fine and 1,360 years in prison rather than a $1.25 million fine and 25 years in prison. In these circumstances, the rule of lenity, not to mention a dose of common sense, favors a strict construction. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 12, n. 8, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (lenity applies when a disputed statutory provision has both criminal and noncriminal applications), see also FCC, 347 U.S. at 296, 74 S.Ct. 593, United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U.S. 505, 517-518, 112 S.Ct. 2102, 119 L.Ed.2d 308 (1992) (plurality opinion).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-013,70,"Best read, the BSA treats the failure to file a legally compliant report as one violation carrying a maximum penalty of $10,000, not a cascade of such penalties calculated on a per-account basis. Because the Fifth Circuit thought otherwise, we reverse its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Gorsuch,0,

2022-013,73,"Alexandru Bittner, an American citizen, held as much as $16 million across more  than 50 bank accounts in Romania, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein.* He acknowledges that the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations required him to report his interest in these accounts to the Federal Government annually. Bittner also admits that he failed to comply with that requirement for five consecutive years. Because he failed to report 272 accounts, the Government concluded that he violated the law 272 times and assessed a penalty for each violation. Bittner, on the other hand, argued that he violated the law just five times—once for each annual form that he failed to file.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,74,"The Court agrees with Bittner and holds that the failure to file a legally compliant form is a single violation, no matter how many accounts a citizen fails to report. I respectfully disagree. The most natural reading of the statute establishes that each failure to report a qualifying foreign account constitutes a separate reporting violation, so the Government can levy penalties on a per-account basis.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,76,"This case requires us to decide whether a violation of the BSA's reporting requirement is the failure to file an annual form, or whether there is a separate violation for each individual account that is not properly reported. The answer lies in the text of the relevant statutes, 31 U.S.C. §§ 5314 and 5321. The Government assessed penalties against Bittner under § 5321(a)(5)(A), which provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may impose a civil money penalty on any person who violates, or causes any violation of, any provision of section 5314. Section 5314, in turn, directs the Secretary to require a  citizen of the United States  to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file reports, when the  person makes a transaction or maintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency. § 5314(a). The required records and reports shall contain certain information in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes, such as the identity, address, and legal capacity of the participants in a transaction or relationship. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,77,"The text of § 5314 indicates that its reporting requirement attaches to each individual account. Most notably, it provides that the Secretary shall require a citizen to file reports when he maintains a relation  with a foreign financial agency. Ibid. The subject matter of the required reports, then, is a relation with a foreign financial agency—or, more colloquially, an account with a foreign bank. Ibid. In other words, each relation with a foreign bank triggers the requirement to file reports. And because each relation is a matter of distinct concern under the statute, each failure to report an account violates the reporting requirement.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,78,"The enumerated list of information that the reports shall contain underscores the point. Ibid. That list includes information like the identity and address of participants in a  relationship, the legal capacity in which a participant in a relationship is acting, and the identity of real parties in interest. §§ 5314(a)(1)-(3). Each listed item is account specific because its contents can vary for each foreign account held. And each failure to report an account thus deprives the Government of the account-specific information that the statute requires.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,79,"That is not all. Section 5314 authorizes the Secretary to impose a recordkeeping  requirement in addition to a reporting requirement. Recordkeeping violations cannot occur on a per-form basis because keeping records does not entail filing a form. Instead, they occur on a per-account basis because records naturally relate to specific accounts. And if violations of § 5314's recordkeeping obligation accrue on a per-account basis, the same should be true of violations of § 5314's obligation to file reports. The duties are parallel: Each kicks in when a citizen maintains a relation with a foreign financial agency, and each requires a person to collect the same account-specific information. § 5314(a). Parallel duties should be susceptible to parallel violations.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,80,"The civil penalty provisions in § 5321 confirm this reading of the substantive obligations imposed by § 5314. Recall that § 5321 allows the Secretary to impose a civil money penalty on any person who violates, or causes any violation of, any provision of section 5314. § 5321(a)(5)(A). The statute then proceeds to set the maximum penalty for nonwillful violations, provide a reasonable cause exception for those same violations, and set the maximum penalty for willful violations. §§ 5321(a)(5)(B)-(D). Throughout, Congress used the term violation in an account-specific way.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,81,"Consider the reasonable cause exception. It provides that no penalty shall be imposed  with respect to any nonwillful violation of § 5314 if (1) such violation was due to reasonable cause and (2) the balance in the account at the time of the transaction was properly reported. § 5321(a)(5)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). By conditioning eligibility for the excuse on taking steps to report accurate information about a particular account, this language suggests that the underlying violation of § 5314 is similarly tied to a specific account. After all, if the exception for non-willful violations applies on a per-account basis, then logically the violations the exception forgives must arise on a per-account basis too. 19 F.4th 734, 747-748 (C.A.5 2021).",Barrett,0,
2022-013,82,"The willful penalty provisions sing the same tune. The maximum penalty for a willful violation is the greater of $100,000 or, in the case of a violation involving a failure to report the existence of an account or any identifying information required to be provided with respect to an account, 50 percent of the balance in the account at the time of the violation. §§ 5321(a)(5)(C)(i), (D)(ii). This language makes clear that a violation may involve `a failure to report the existence of' a particular account. United States v. Boyd, 991 F.3d 1077, 1089 (C.A.9 2021) (Ikuta, J., dissenting). By making the maximum penalty for a willful violation in some cases a function of the balance in the account at the time of the violation, the provision contemplates that discrete violations correspond to discrete accounts. § 5321(a)(5)(D)(ii).",Barrett,0,
2022-013,83,"This pattern matters. The normal rule of statutory interpretation is that identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning. IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005). If a violation of § 5314 has account-specific connotations in the reasonable cause and willful penalty provisions, it follows that a violation of § 5314 has account-specific connotations when it comes to nonwillful penalties too.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,84,"The Secretary's implementing regulations follow the BSA's lead. They require regulated persons to report the existence of each foreign financial account to the Government each year. Start with 31 C.F.R. § 1010.350 (2011). It says that each United States person having a financial interest in  a bank, securities, or other financial account in a foreign  country shall report such relationship to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for each year in which such relationship exists and shall provide such information as shall be specified in a reporting form prescribed under 31 U.S.C. 5314 to be filed by such persons. § 1010.350(a) (emphasis added). The reporting form is known as an FBAR—a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. Ibid. A separate regulation establishes the deadline for reporting these relationships. Reports required to be filed by § 1010.350 shall be filed by June 30 of each calendar year with respect to foreign financial accounts exceeding $10,000 maintained during the previous calendar year. § 1010.306(c), as amended, 81 Fed. Reg. 76864 (2016). Put together, these provisions impose a substantive obligation to report interests in foreign bank accounts each year in which those interests exist. See § 1010.420 (referring to accounts required by § 1010.350 to be reported to the Government).",Barrett,0,
2022-013,85,"Notably, the regulations distinguish between the form used to report accounts and the reports themselves. See § 1010.306(d) (the reports required by § 1010.350 shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Secretary (emphasis added)), § 1010.306(e) (the forms to be used in making the reports required by § 1010.350 may be obtained from the Government (emphasis added)). This underscores that FBAR forms are not themselves the reports required by the statute, rather, they are the procedural mechanism used to implement the duty to report each foreign account. This distinction tracks § 5314, which emphasizes a citizen's duty to file reports but nowhere mentions FBARs—or, for that matter, forms of any sort. § 5314(a). So far as § 5314 is concerned, the Secretary could have chosen a different mechanism to implement the statute. For instance, rather than instructing citizens to report all accounts on a single form, he could have instructed citizens to report each account on a separate form. And if the Secretary had taken that route, Bittner would be hard pressed to deny that he would have violated the statute 272 times by failing to file 272 forms. That difficulty illustrates Bittner's fundamental misunderstanding of the account-specific obligation imposed by § 5314, which is indifferent to the mechanism by which the obligation is discharged.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,86,"In the end, the applicable statute and regulations make clear that any failure to report a foreign account is an independent violation, subject to independent penalties. Boyd, 991 F.3d at 1089 (Ikuta, J., dissenting). A person who fails to report multiple foreign accounts on a single annual form violates the BSA and its implementing regulations multiple times, not just once. So the Government was within its rights to assess a separate penalty against Bittner for each qualifying foreign account that he failed to report properly.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,89,"The Court reads the relevant provisions differently. It reasons that the legal duty imposed by § 5314 is the duty to file reports. Ante, at 719. In the Court's view, that statutory obligation is binary: Either one files a report `in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes,' or one does not. Ante, at 719. So penalties for nonwillful violations must accrue on a per-report, not a per-account, basis. Ante, at 720. And because Bittner failed to file timely FBARs for five years, the Court concludes that he violated the law only five times.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,90,"The Court's core error is to conflate the reports referred to in § 5314 with the annual FBAR form. To reiterate, the two are  distinct. And because the FBAR is not itself the statutorily required report, the Court's conclusion—that Bittner violated § 5314 just five times because he untimely filed five FBAR forms—does not follow. The BSA and its implementing regulations required Bittner to file one report per year of each qualifying foreign financial account that he maintained. Each failure to report an account is a discrete violation regardless of whether the violations were clustered on a single form.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,91,"The Court does not just misread § 5314, it misreads § 5321 too. It points out that account-specific language is present in the reasonable cause and willful penalty provisions but absent in the provisions setting the nonwillful penalty. Because Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another, Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 391, 135 S.Ct. 913, 190 L.Ed.2d 771 (2015), the Court takes the contrast as evidence that nonwillful penalties cannot apply on a per-account basis. Ante, at 719-721 (invoking the expressio unius canon).",Barrett,0,
2022-013,92,"Not so. The expressio unius canon is a general rule, inapplicable where context suggests otherwise—as it does here. Congress capped the penalty for a nonwillful violation at a flat $10,000. § 5321(a)(5)(B)(i). Because the penalty amount does not depend on the balance in an account, Congress had no reason to use account-specific language. By contrast, the maximum penalty for a willful violation is the greater of $100,000 or 50 percent of the account balance at the time of the violation, and the reasonable cause exception lifts a penalty only if the account balance was properly reported. §§ 5321(a)(5)(B)(ii), (C)(i), (D)(ii). Because the application of both provisions depends on the account balance, Congress needed to use account-specific language. The reason why Congress included account-specific language in only two of these three provisions is therefore readily apparent. Regardless, the variation in language does not do much for the Court. These provisions in § 5321 explain the varying penalties that the Secretary may assess for a violation of § 5314 but do not alter the nature of the underlying conduct that constitutes a violation. Boyd, 991 F.3d at 1089 (Ikuta, J., dissenting). That conduct, as discussed, is account specific.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,94,"The Court also invokes a handful of contextual clues to support its conclusion. Ante, at 721-722. None of these clues justifies a departure from the best reading of the text.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,95,"Begin with the Government's guidance to the public about what the BSA requires. The Court identifies a handful of statements, primarily from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) fact sheets and form instructions, indicating that a failure to file an annual FBAR may result in a penalty of up to $10,000. The Court acknowledges that these materials do not control the analysis, yet it still goes on to suggest that they cut against the Government's interpretation. Ante, at 721-722.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,96,"I am surprised that the Court is moved by this administrative guidance. For one thing, even Bittner concedes that the materials do not speak directly to the question presented in this case: whether additional penalties may accrue when a person fails to report multiple accounts on a single form. Reply Brief 18, Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40. For another, the Court neglects to mention administrative materials that endorse the Government's per-account interpretation. See, e.g., Brief for American College of Tax Counsel as Amicus Curiae 18, 21 (identifying IRS staff guidance materials  from 2008 and 2015 explaining that FBAR penalties may be assessed per account). But in any event, guidance materials add little, if anything, to the interpretive enterprise when the traditional tools of construction supply an answer.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,97,"The Court also highlights the Secretary's regulatory decision to allow the rare covered person with 25 or more foreign financial accounts to only provide the number of financial accounts and certain other basic information on the report. § 1010.350(g)(1). According to the Court, this special rule is a knock against the Government's reading because it does not require detailed account-level information in such a filer's initial report. Ante, at 723.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,98,"But the Secretary's accommodation does not advance the Court's cause. A person with 25 or more accounts still will be required to provide detailed information concerning each account when so requested by the Secretary or his delegate. § 1010.350(g)(1). And the Secretary's recordkeeping regulation requires covered persons to retain the same detailed information about each account that otherwise would be reported on the annual form. See § 1010.420. So a person with 25 or more accounts violates the BSA for each account with a reporting or recordkeeping problem just the same as a person with fewer than 25 accounts. In both cases, the violation is the failure to report the account properly or to keep records of it.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,99,"That consequence is consistent with the statute's purpose. In arguing otherwise, the Court leans on what the preamble does not say: That Congress sought to maximize penalties for every nonwillful mistake. Ante, at 723. Notably, though, the Court skims over what the preamble does say: that the BSA is designed to require certain reports or records that assist the Government in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations and in intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against terrorism. 31 U.S.C. § 5311. When analyzing complex webs of money laundering or funding for international terrorism, knowing about every account matters—and lacking information about 15 accounts is certainly more harmful to law enforcement than lacking information about 1 account. See Brief for United States 38. Given the stated purpose, authorizing a penalty for each undisclosed account makes sense.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,100,"Finally, the Court insists that a per-account reading leads to absurd results. Its concerns range from the overstated to the incorrect, and they are in any event of limited relevance to the statutory interpretation question before us.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,101,"First, the Court posits a comparison between a person who nonwillfully violates the law once by failing to report a single account with a balance of $10 million and a person who nonwillfully violates the law 12 times by failing to report 12 accounts with an aggregate balance of $10,001. Because the first is subject to a maximum penalty of $10,000 and the second is subject to a maximum penalty of $120,000, the Court concludes that there is an incongruity in the statutory scheme. Ante, at 723-724. But a person who violates the law many times might naturally pay a steeper price than a person who violates the law just once, regardless of the balances in their unreported accounts. Indeed, the Court seems untroubled by the incongruity that flows from its own reading: The Secretary is constrained by the same maximum penalty ($10,000) for a person who nonwillfully fails to report 100 accounts on an annual FBAR as he is for a person who nonwillfully fails to report just 1 account. The per-form reading makes it difficult for the Government to assess stiffer penalties for more serious noncompliance.",Barrett,0,
2022-013,102,"Consider next the Court's claim that, on the Government's reading, those who willfully violate the law may face lower penalties than those who nonwillfully violate the law. Ibid. The Court provides the example of a person who holds $1 million in a foreign account during the course of a year but withdraws those funds before the filing deadline and willfully fails to report the account. Under § 5321(a)(5)(C), that person faces a maximum penalty of $100,000, while a person who nonwillfully fails to report 20 accounts with an aggregate account balance of $50,000 might face a penalty of up to $200,000 under § 5321(a)(5)(B)(i). This is not an apples-to-apples comparison: The first person willfully violated the law once, while the second nonwillfully violated the law 20 times. That the latter might face a higher penalty than the former is therefore beside the point. An actual apples-to-apples comparison shows that willful violators do face a much heavier fine: The maximum penalty for a single willful violation will always be at least 10 times greater than the maximum penalty for a single nonwillful violation. See §§ 5321(a)(5)(B)(i), (C)(i).",Barrett,0,
2022-013,104,"There is no denying that the Government opted to pursue a substantial penalty in this case: $10,000 for each of Bittner's 272 alleged violations, for a total penalty of $2.72 million. Yet while the statutory scheme allows for substantial penalties, it also offers a safe haven. No penalty shall be imposed for a nonwillful violation of § 5314 if (1) such violation was due to reasonable cause and (2) the balance in the account at the time of the transaction was properly reported. § 5321(a)(5)(B)(ii).",Barrett,0,
2022-013,105,"Bittner raised this defense below, and the Government conceded that he satisfied its second prong by properly reporting the balances in his accounts on his late-filed FBARs. 19 F.4th at 740, and n. 2. But the District Court and Court of Appeals both roundly rejected Bittner's argument that he had reasonable cause for failing to timely report his accounts. After evaluating the pertinent facts and circumstances, both courts concluded that Bittner did not exercise ordinary business care and prudence in failing to fulfill his reporting obligations. Id., at 742, see also 469 F.Supp.3d 709, 729 (E.D. Tex. 2020). On the contrary, Bittner put no effort into ascertaining those obligations despite operating as a sophisticated business professional who held interests in dozens of companies, negotiated purchases of Romanian government assets, transferred his assets into holding companies, and concealed his earnings in `numbered accounts.' 19 F.4th at 742. Bittner abandoned his reasonable cause argument when he came to this Court, so we have no occasion to consider its merit. Brief for Petitioner 11, n. 9.

2022-013,106,"The most natural reading of the BSA and its implementing regulations establishes that a person who fails to report multiple accounts on the prescribed reporting form violates the law multiple times, not just once.

2022-015,37,"In each of these two cases, the respondent in an administrative enforcement action challenges the constitutional authority of the agency to proceed. Both respondents claim that the agencies' administrative law judges (ALJs) are insufficiently accountable to the President, in violation of separation-of-powers principles.

The enforcement actions at issue were initiated in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Most objections to those Commissions' proceedings follow a well-trod path. As prescribed by statute, a party makes its claims first within the Commission itself, and then (if needed) in a federal court of appeals. The parties here, however, sidestepped that review scheme. Seeking to stop the administrative proceedings, they instead brought their claims in federal district court. The question presented is whether the district courts have jurisdiction to hear those suits—and so to resolve the parties' constitutional challenges to the Commissions' structure. The answer is yes. The ordinary statutory review scheme does not preclude a district court from entertaining these extraordinary claims.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,40,"Congress established the SEC to protect investors in securities markets, and created the FTC to promote fair competition. The Commissions enforce, respectively, the Securities Exchange Act and the FTC Act (among other laws). See 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq. (Exchange Act), 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq. (FTC Act). Those Acts authorize the Commissions to address statutory violations either by bringing civil suits in federal district court or by instituting their own administrative proceedings. See §§ 78u(d), 78u-1, 78u-2, 78u-3, §§ 45(b), (m).",Kagan,0,
2022-015,41,"When a Commission elects the latter option—as in these two cases—it typically delegates the initial adjudication to an ALJ. See § 78d-1(a), note following § 41. To foster independence, each Commission's ALJs are removable only for good cause as determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)—a separate agency whose members are themselves removable by the President only for cause, such as neglect of duty or malfeasance. 5 U.S.C. §§ 7521(a), 1202(d). An  ALJ assigned to hear an SEC or FTC enforcement action has authority, much like a regular trial judge, to resolve motions, hold a hearing, and then issue a decision. See 16 C.F.R. §§ 3.21-3.56 (2021), 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.221-201.360 (2021).",Kagan,0,

See 16 C.F.R. §§ 3.52-3.53, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.410-201.411. Upon completion of internal review, the Commission enters a final decision. See 16 C.F.R. § 3.54, 17 C.F.R. § 201.411(a). Or if no such review has occurred, the ALJ's ruling itself becomes the decision of the Commission. See 15 U.S.C. § 78d-1(c), 16 C.F.R. § 3.51(a).",Kagan,0,
2022-015,43,"The Exchange Act and FTC Act both provide for review of a final Commission decision in a court of appeals, rather than a district court. Under the Exchange Act, a person aggrieved by an SEC final order  may obtain review of the order by filing a petition in a court of appeals. 15 U.S.C. § 78y(a)(1). That petition gives the appellate court jurisdiction to affirm or modify and enforce or to set aside the order in whole or in part. § 78y(a)(3). The FTC Act similarly provides that the party subject to an FTC order may obtain a review of such order in a court of appeals, and grants the court jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside the order. § 45(c).",Kagan,0,
2022-015,44,"The cases before us, though, did not take the above-described course. In each, the respondent in an administrative enforcement action sued in district court prior to an ALJ decision, seeking to enjoin the Commission's proceeding. Each suit charged that some fundamental aspect of the Commission's structure violates the Constitution, that the violation made the entire proceeding unlawful, and that being subjected to such an illegitimate proceeding causes legal injury (independent of any rulings the ALJ might make). Finally, each suit premised jurisdiction on district courts' ordinary federal-question authority —their power, under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, to resolve civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. We describe the two cases in turn, but what we have just said they have in common is really all it is necessary to know.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,45,"The first case arises from an SEC enforcement action brought against Michelle Cochran, a certified public accountant. In an earlier round of that proceeding, an ALJ found that Cochran had failed to comply with auditing standards, in violation of the Exchange Act. But soon after that decision issued, this Court held that the SEC's ALJs had been improperly appointed. See Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 2044, 201 L.Ed.2d 464 (2018). In compliance with that ruling, the SEC ordered a fresh hearing, conducted by a now validly appointed ALJ. That was the last straw for Cochran. Before the new ALJ hearing began, she sued the Commission in federal district court, asserting jurisdiction under § 1331. Cochran's complaint focused on the two layers of tenure protection all ALJs hold: By statute, those officials may be removed only for good cause as determined by the MSPB, whose members themselves can only be removed by the President for good cause. App. 60, see supra, at 897. That arrangement, Cochran asserted, so greatly insulates ALJs from presidential supervision as to violate the separation of powers— more specifically, Article II's vesting of executive power in the President. See App. 53-54, 60-62. And because that was true (Cochran continued), ALJs could not constitutionally exercise power: They could neither hold any hearings nor make any  decisions. Cochran thus sought declaratory and injunctive relief freeing her of the obligation to submit to an unconstitutional proceeding. Id., at 60, see id., at 64.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,46,"The second case arises from an FTC enforcement action against Axon Enterprise, a company that makes and sells policing equipment. In its complaint, the FTC alleged that Axon's purchase of its closest competitor violated the FTC Act's ban on unfair methods of competition. To stop the FTC from pursuing that charge, Axon did just what Cochran had—brought suit against the Commission in district court, premised on federal-question jurisdiction. Like Cochran, Axon asserted that the Commission's ALJs could not constitutionally exercise governmental authority because of their dual-layer protection from removal. In addition, Axon claimed that the combination of prosecutorial and adjudicative functions in the Commission renders all of its enforcement actions unconstitutional. See Complaint in No. 2:20-cv-00014 (D Ariz.), ECF Doc. 1, p. 26 (protesting that the FTC will act as prosecutor, judge, and jury). Again similarly to Cochran, Axon asked the court to enjoin the FTC from subjecting it to the Commission's unfair and unconstitutional internal forum. Id., at 7, see id., at 28.1",Kagan,0,
2022-015,47,"Cochran's and Axon's suits met an identical fate in district court: dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The district court in Cochran's case held that the review scheme specified in the Exchange Act— administrative review followed by judicial review in a federal court of appeals— implicitly divests district courts of jurisdiction over challenges to SEC proceedings, including Cochran's constitutional ones. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21-1239, p. 141a. Likewise, the district court in Axon's case found that the FTC Act's comparable review scheme displaces § 1331 jurisdiction for claims concerning the FTC's adjudications. So Axon had to raise its structural constitutional claims during the administrative process and then renew them if and when seeking review in the Court of Appeals. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21-86, pp. 50-51.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,48,"On appeal from those decisions, the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits split. The Ninth Circuit, considering Axon's case, reached the same conclusion as the district courts. See 986 F.3d 1173 (2021). Reviewing this Court's precedents, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that a statutory review scheme precluding district court jurisdiction —like the FTC Act's—might not extend to every type of claim. Id., at 1187 (citing Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 212, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994)). But the court decided that Axon's constitutional challenges fell within the FTC Act's scheme, mainly because the scheme guaranteed them meaningful judicial review. 986 F.3d at 1181, 1187. The en banc Fifth Circuit disagreed as to the equivalent SEC question. See 20 F.4th 194 (2021). The court maintained that Cochran's removal power claim is not the type of claim Congress intended to  funnel through the Exchange Act's statutory-review scheme. Id., at 206-207 (also citing Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771). Drawing on considerations identified in this Court's opinions, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that Cochran's claim would not receive meaningful judicial review in a court of appeals, that the claim was wholly collateral to the Exchange Act's statutory-review scheme, and that the claim fell outside the SEC's expertise. 20 F.4th at 207-208.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,49,"We granted certiorari in both cases to resolve the division. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 895, 211 L.Ed.2d 604 (2022), 596 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2707, 212 L.Ed.2d 777 (2022). We now conclude that the review schemes set out in the Exchange Act and the FTC Act do not displace district court jurisdiction over Axon's and Cochran's far-reaching constitutional claims.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,52,"A special statutory review scheme, this Court has recognized, may preclude district courts from exercising jurisdiction over challenges to federal agency action. See, e.g., Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207, 114 S.Ct. 771. District courts may ordinarily hear those challenges by way of 28 U.S.C. § 1331's grant of jurisdiction for claims arising under federal law. Congress, though, may substitute for that district court authority an alternative scheme of review. Congress of course may do so explicitly, providing in so many words that district court jurisdiction will yield. But Congress also may do so implicitly, by specifying a different method to resolve claims about agency action. The method Congress typically chooses is the one used in both the Exchange Act and the FTC Act: review in a court of appeals following the agency's own review process. We have several times held that the creation of such a review scheme for agency action divests district courts of their ordinary jurisdiction over the covered cases. See Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207-212, 114 S.Ct. 771, Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10-15, 132 S.Ct. 2126, 183 L.Ed.2d 1 (2012), see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 489, 130 S.Ct. 3138, 177 L.Ed.2d 706 (2010) (noting that statutory schemes for agency review generally are exclusive). The agency effectively fills in for the district court, with the court of appeals providing judicial review.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,53,"But a statutory review scheme of that kind does not necessarily extend to every claim concerning agency action. Our decision in Thunder Basin made that point clear. After finding that Congress's creation of a comprehensive review process like the ones here ousted district courts of jurisdiction, the Court asked another question: whether the particular claims brought were of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within this statutory structure. 510 U.S. at 208, 212, 114 S.Ct. 771. The Court identified three considerations designed to aid in that inquiry, commonly known now as the Thunder Basin factors. First, could precluding district court jurisdiction foreclose all meaningful judicial review of the claim? Id., at 212-213, 114 S.Ct. 771. Next, is the claim wholly collateral to the statute's review provisions? Id., at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771 (internal quotation marks omitted). And last, is the claim outside the agency's expertise? Ibid. When the answer to all three questions is yes, we presume that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction. Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 489, 130 S.Ct. 3138. But the same conclusion might follow if the factors point in different directions. The ultimate question is how best to understand what Congress has done—whether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies, reaches the  claim in question. The first Thunder Basin factor recognizes that Congress rarely allows claims about agency action to escape effective judicial review. See, e.g., Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986). The second and third reflect in related ways the point of special review provisions—to give the agency a heightened role in the matters it customarily handles, and can apply distinctive knowledge to.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,54,"This Court has twice held specific claims to fit within a statutory review scheme, based on the Thunder Basin factors. In Thunder Basin itself, a coal company subject to the Mine Act filed suit in district court instead of asserting its claims—as a statutory scheme prescribed—before a mine safety commission and then (if needed) a court of appeals. The crux of the dispute concerned the company's refusal to provide employee-designated union officials with access to the workplace, as the Mine Act apparently required. The company claimed a right to exclude the officials under another statute, it also objected on due process grounds to the agency's imposing a fine before holding a hearing. See 510 U.S. at 205, 114 S.Ct. 771, see also Elgin, 567 U.S. at 17, n. 6, 132 S.Ct. 2126. We held the district court to lack jurisdiction over those claims, and thus directed the company back to the statutory review scheme. The Commission, we emphasized, had extensive experience in addressing the statutory issues raised, and could resolve them in ways that brought to bear its expertise over the mining industry. 510 U.S. at 214-215, 114 S.Ct. 771, see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 491, 130 S.Ct. 3138. All that was less so, we acknowledged, of the company's constitutional challenge, but that claim could be meaningfully addressed in the Court of Appeals. 510 U.S. at 215, 114 S.Ct. 771.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,55,"We applied similar reasoning in Elgin. The statutory review scheme there directed federal employees challenging discharge decisions to seek review in the MSPB and then, if needed, in the Federal Circuit (a specific court of appeals). But Elgin filed suit in district court when he was fired by the government for failing to register for the draft. We held that the court lacked jurisdiction even though Elgin mainly claimed that the draft law, in excluding women, violated the Equal Protection Clause. Although the MSPB might not be able to hold the draft law unconstitutional, we stated, the Court of Appeals could—and that was sufficient to ensure meaningful review of Elgin's claim. 567 U.S. at 21, 132 S.Ct. 2126. Still more, Elgin's claim was neither collateral to the MSPB's ordinary proceedings nor unrelated to its expertise. We reasoned that a challenge to a discharge is precisely the type of personnel action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB. Id., at 22, 132 S.Ct. 2126. And we observed that such an action could involve threshold and other questions unique to the employment context that fall squarely within the MSPB's expertise. Id., at 22-23, 132 S.Ct. 2126.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,56,"But in Free Enterprise Fund, this Court went the opposite way, holding that certain claims landed outside a statutory review scheme. The scheme was the Exchange Act's—the same as in Cochran's case. And the main claim in Free Enterprise Fund bears more than a passing resemblance to one Axon and Cochran raise: It, too, alleged that officials with two layers of tenure protection were unconstitutionally insulated from presidential control. The officials challenged, though, were different. They were members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board—an agency regulating the accounting industry under the SEC's oversight. When the Board opened an investigation of an accounting firm's auditing practices,  the firm took its Article II claim to district court. This time we held that the court had jurisdiction of the action, based on the Thunder Basin factors. We found that the Exchange Act provided no meaningful avenue of relief for the firm, given the separation between the Board and the Commission. 561 U.S. at 490-491, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Not every Board action, we explained, culminates in Commission action—which alone the statute makes reviewable in a court of appeals. And even supposing the SEC took up a matter arising from the Board's investigation, the firm's constitutional challenge would be collateral to the subject of that proceeding. The firm, we observed, objects to the Board's existence, not to any of its auditing standards. Id., at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138. Finally, we held, the firm's claim was outside the Commission's competence and expertise. Id., at 491, 130 S.Ct. 3138. It raised only a standard issue of administrative and constitutional law, relating not at all to considerations of agency policy. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).",Kagan,0,
2022-015,58,"One way of framing the question we must decide is whether the cases before us are more like Thunder Basin and Elgin or more like Free Enterprise Fund. The answer appears from 30,000 feet not very hard. Recall our task: to decide if a claim is of the type Congress thought belonged within a statutory scheme. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771. The claims here are of the same ilk as the one in Free Enterprise Fund. There, the complaint alleged that the Board's freedom from Presidential oversight rendered unconstitutional all power and authority the Board exercised. 561 U.S. at 508, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Only the Court's ability to sever the relevant statute's for-cause removal provision enabled the Board to keep running. See ibid. The Article II challenges in Axon's and Cochran's cases would likewise prevent ALJs—through whom the Commissions do much of their work—from exercising any power, unless they lose their double-for-cause tenure protection. And Axon's combination-of-functions claim similarly goes to the core of the FTC's existence, given that the agency indeed houses (and by design) both prosecutorial and adjudicative activities. The challenges here, as in Free Enterprise Fund, are not to any specific substantive decision—say, to fining a company (Thunder Basin) or firing an employee (Elgin). Nor are they to the commonplace procedures agencies use to make such a decision. They are instead challenges, again as in Free Enterprise Fund, to the structure or very existence of an agency: They charge that an agency is wielding authority unconstitutionally in all or a broad swath of its work. Given that equivalence, it would be surprising to treat the claims here differently from the one in Free Enterprise Fund—which we held belonged in district court.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,59,"And when we apply the Thunder Basin factors, we indeed come out in the same place as Free Enterprise Fund. Our reasoning differs in some particulars, reflecting variations between that case and the two here. But the 30,000-foot view of the issue before us ends up a good proxy for the more granular one. Each of the three Thunder Basin factors signals that a district court has jurisdiction to adjudicate Axon's and Cochran's (like the accounting firm's) sweeping constitutional claims.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,60,"We begin with the factor whose application here is least straightforward: whether preclusion of district court jurisdiction could foreclose all meaningful judicial review. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at  212-213, 114 S.Ct. 771. Thunder Basin and Elgin both make clear that adequate judicial review does not usually demand a district court's involvement. Review of agency action in a court of appeals can alone meaningfully address a party's claims. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 215, 114 S.Ct. 771, see Elgin, 567 U.S. at 21, 132 S.Ct. 2126 (holding that Congress provided meaningful review in authorizing the Federal Circuit to consider and decide petitioners' constitutional claims).2 Still more, we agree with the Government that the reason Free Enterprise Fund gave for departing from Thunder Basin and Elgin on the judicial review issue does not apply to the cases before us. See Brief for Federal Parties 39-40. As just described, Free Enterprise Fund's analysis on that score relied on the separation between the Board and the SEC. See supra, at 901-902. The accounting firm, recall, was enmeshed in a Board investigation. But some Board actions never go to the SEC—and the statutory scheme, we explained, provides only for judicial review of Commission action. 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (emphasis in original). That meant the accounting firm, absent district court jurisdiction, might never have had judicial recourse. But no such worry exists here. Cochran and Axon are parties in ongoing SEC and FTC proceedings, and the statutes at issue provide for judicial review of SEC and FTC action. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(c), 78y(a). Under those statutes, Axon and Cochran can (eventually) obtain review of their constitutional claims through an appeal from an adverse agency action to a court of appeals. So Free Enterprise Fund's analysis of the judicial review factor does not control.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,61,"Yet a problem remains, stemming from the interaction between the alleged injury and the timing of review. To see the difficulty, think first about Thunder Basin and Elgin. If an appellate court had ruled in favor of the coal company or the federal employee on review of an agency decision, the court could have remedied the party's injury. It could have revoked the fine assessed on the company or reinstated the employee with backpay. But not so here. The harm Axon and Cochran allege is being subjected to unconstitutional agency authority—a proceeding by an unaccountable ALJ. Brief for Axon 36, see Brief for Cochran 37 (contending she suffers harm from having to appear in proceedings before an unconstitutionally insulated ALJ). That harm may sound a bit abstract, but this Court has made clear that it is a here-and-now injury. Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 2183, 2196, 207 L.Ed.2d 494 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). And—here is the rub—it is impossible to remedy once the proceeding is over, which is when appellate review kicks in. Suppose a court of appeals agrees with Axon, on review of an adverse FTC decision, that ALJ-led proceedings violate the separation of powers. The court could of course vacate the FTC's order. But Axon's separation-of-powers claim is not about that order, indeed, Axon would have the same claim had it won before the agency. The claim, again, is about subjection to an illegitimate proceeding, led by an illegitimate decisionmaker.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,62,"And as to that grievance, the court of appeals can do nothing: A proceeding that has already happened cannot be undone. Judicial review of Axon's (and Cochran's) structural constitutional claims would come too late to be meaningful.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,63,"The limits of that conclusion are important to emphasize. The Government, in disputing our position, notes that many review schemes—involving not only agency action but also civil and criminal litigation —require parties to wait before appealing, even when doing so subjects them to significant burdens. Brief for Federal Parties 47-49. That is true, and will remain so: Nothing we say today portends newfound enthusiasm for interlocutory review. Return, for example, to Thunder Basin and Elgin. There, the coal company and federal employee could both have argued that the statutory review process would subject them to greater litigation costs than their preferred suit in district court. But that would not have mattered. We have made clear, just as the Government says, that the expense and disruption of protracted adjudicatory proceedings on a claim do not justify immediate review. FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 244, 101 S.Ct. 488, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980), see, e.g., Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938). What makes the difference here is the nature of the claims and accompanying harms that the parties are asserting. Again, Axon and Cochran protest the here-and-now injury of subjection to an unconstitutionally structured decisionmaking process. See supra, at 903-904. And more, subjection to that process irrespective of its outcome, or of other decisions made within it. A nearer analogy than any the Government offers is to our established immunity doctrines. There, we have identified certain rights not to stand trial or face other legal processes. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). And we have recognized that those rights are effectively lost if review is deferred until after trial. Ibid. So too here, Axon and Cochran will lose their rights not to undergo the complained-of agency proceedings if they cannot assert those rights until the proceedings are over.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,64,"The collateralism factor favors Axon and Cochran for much the same reason—because they are challenging the Commissions' power to proceed at all, rather than actions taken in the agency proceedings. That distinction, as noted earlier, guided Free Enterprise Fund's view that the accounting firm's challenge qualified as collateral. See 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138, supra, at 901-902. The firm, the court reasoned, objected to the Board's existence, not to any of the auditing standards it might apply in regulating accountants. 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138. Likewise here, both parties object to the Commissions' power generally, not to anything particular about how that power was wielded. The parties' separation-of-powers claims do not relate to the subject of the enforcement actions—in the one case auditing practices, in the other a business merger. Cf. Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (considering as part of the collateral order doctrine, which governs appeals in non-agency litigation, whether a question is separate from the merits). Nor do the parties' claims address the sorts of procedural or evidentiary matters an agency often resolves on its way to a merits decision. Cf. Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985) (favoring review of such preliminary matters along with the agency's final order). The claims, in sum, have nothing to do with the enforcement-related matters  the Commissions regularly adjudicate —and nothing to do with those they would adjudicate in assessing the charges against Axon and Cochran. Elgin, 567 U.S. at 22, 132 S.Ct. 2126. Because that is so, the parties' claims are `collateral' to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought. Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,65,"The Government's contrary argument would strip the collateralism factor of its appropriate function. In the Government's view, no claim directed at a pending Commission proceeding can qualify as collateral to it, even if wholly disconnected in subject. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-86, p. 75, see Brief for Federal Parties 39, 52-53. The Government thinks that position consistent with Free Enterprise Fund because there an SEC proceeding had not yet begun. See Brief for Federal Parties 38-39 (noting that the accounting firm remained enmeshed in a Board investigation). But the Government's argument still conflicts with Free Enterprise Fund's reasoning. In addressing why the firm's claim was collateral, the Court focused solely on what it was about—again, that the firm challenged the Board's existence, not its auditing standards. 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138. And anyway, the Government's theory ill fits the point of the Thunder Basin inquiry —to decide when a particular claim is of the type to fall outside a statutory review scheme. 510 U.S. at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771. That inquiry, just as Free Enterprise Fund recognized, requires considering the nature of the claim, not the status (pending or not) of an agency proceeding. Or said another way, the inquiry contemplates (as our collateral-order doctrine also does) that even when a proceeding is pending, an occasional claim may get immediate review —in part because it involves something discrete. Cf. Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) (allowing an interlocutory appeal from a district court's collateral ruling, independent of the cause itself). The Government's redefinition of what counts as collateral would effectively foreclose that possibility.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,66,"Third and finally, Cochran's and Axon's claims are outside the Commissions' expertise. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771. On that issue, Free Enterprise Fund could hardly be clearer. Claims that tenure protections violate Article II, the Court there determined, raise standard questions of administrative and constitutional law, detached from considerations of agency policy. 561 U.S. at 491, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), see supra, at 901-902. That statement covers Axon's and Cochran's claims that ALJs are too far insulated from the President's supervision. And Axon's constitutional challenge to the combination of prosecutorial and adjudicative functions is of a piece— similarly distant from the FTC's competence and expertise. 561 U.S. at 491, 130 S.Ct. 3138. The Commission knows a good deal about competition policy, but nothing special about the separation of powers. For that reason, we observed two Terms ago, agency adjudications are generally ill suited to address structural constitutional challenges—like those maintained here. Carr v. Saul, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1352, 1360, 209 L.Ed.2d 376 (2021).",Kagan,0,
2022-015,67,"On this last factor, even the Government mostly gives up the ghost. Its argument goes: Even when an agency lacks expertise in interpreting the Constitution, it can still `apply its expertise' by deciding other issues—whether statutory, regulatory, or factual—that `may obviate the need to address the constitutional challenge.' Brief for Federal Parties 54 (quoting Elgin, 567 U.S. at 22-23, 132 S.Ct. 2126). The first clause of that sentence concedes the  expertise point—and the rest cannot reclaim it. True enough, we partly relied in Elgin on the MSPB's expertise on a raft of ordinary employment issues surrounding the employee's contention that the Equal Protection Clause barred his discharge. See 567 U.S. at 22-23, 132 S.Ct. 2126, supra, at 901. But the Government here does not pretend that Axon's and Cochran's constitutional claims are similarly intertwined with or embedded in matters on which the Commissions are expert. (It is precisely because those claims are not so entangled that the Government must try to redefine what it means for claims to be collateral to an agency action. See supra, at 904-905.) And unlike in Elgin, ruling for Axon and Cochran on expertise-laden grounds would not obviate the need to address their constitutional claims—which, again, allege injury not from this or that ruling but from subjection to all agency authority. Those claims of here-and-now harm would remain no matter how much expertise could be brought to bear on the other issues these cases involve. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 215, 114 S.Ct. 771.",Kagan,0,
2022-015,68,"All three Thunder Basin factors thus point in the same direction—toward allowing district court review of Axon's and Cochran's claims that the structure, or even existence, of an agency violates the Constitution. For the reasons given above, those claims cannot receive meaningful judicial review through the FTC Act or Exchange Act. They are collateral to any decisions the Commissions could make in individual enforcement proceedings. And they fall outside the Commissions' sphere of expertise. Our conclusion follows: The claims are not of the type the statutory review schemes reach. Id., at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771. A district court can therefore review them.* * *",Kagan,0,

2022-015,72,"I join the Court's opinion in full because it correctly applies precedent to determine that Axon Enterprise's and Michelle Cochran's structural constitutional claims need not be channeled through the administrative review schemes at issue. I write separately, however, because I have grave doubts about the constitutional propriety of Congress vesting administrative agencies with primary authority to adjudicate core private rights with only deferential judicial review on the back end.",Thomas,0,
2022-015,75,"The Court correctly notes that precedent allows Congress to replace Article III district courts with an alternative scheme of review, as it did in the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act at issue here. Ante, at 900, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(c) and 78y(a). Under such schemes, administrative agencies may impose orders and penalties on private parties, adjudicate them before agency administrative law judges (ALJs), and only then be subjected to deferential review by an Article III court. As the Court puts it, the agency effectively fills in for the district court, with the court of appeals providing judicial review. Ante, at 900. That Article III review is sharply limited. For example, under the administrative review schemes at issue here, the reviewing court must treat agency findings of fact as conclusive so long as they are  supported by substantial evidence, § 78y(a)(4), see § 45(c) (if supported by evidence), a highly deferential standard of review.1 The reviewing court also cannot take its own evidence—it can only remand the case to the agency for further proceedings. See §§ 45(c) and 78y(a)(5).",Thomas,0,
2022-015,76,"This mixed system—primary adjudication by an executive agency subject to only limited Article III review—is unlike the system that prevailed for the first century of our Nation's existence. During that period, judicial review was all-or-nothing, either a court had authority to review administrative action or not, and if it did, it decided the whole case. T. Merrill, Article III, Agency Adjudication, and the Origins of the Appellate Review Model of Administrative Law, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 939, 944, 952 (2011) (Merrill). This all-or-nothing model rested on a conceptual distinction between core private rights, on the one hand, and mere public rights and governmental privileges, on the other. Disposition of private rights to life, liberty, and property was understood to fall within the core of the judicial power, whereas disposition of public rights was not.

In particular, the extent to which the judiciary reviewed actions and legal determinations of the executive depended on private right. J. Harrison, Jurisdiction, Congressional Power, and Constitutional Remedies, 86 Geo. L. J. 2513, 2516 (1998) (footnote omitted).2 Even today, the distinction between `public rights' and `private rights' continues to inform this Court's understanding of Article III judicial power.

2022-015,77,"As I have explained, when private rights are at stake, full Article III adjudication is likely required. Private rights encompass the three `absolute' rights, life, liberty, and property, so called because they `appertain and belong to particular men merely as individuals,' not `to them as members of society or standing in various relations to each other'—that is, not dependent upon the will of the government. Wellness Int'l Network, 575 U.S. at 713-714, 135 S.Ct. 1932 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 119 (1765), alterations omitted). Such rights could be adjudicated and divested only by Article III courts. See 575 U.S. at 713, 135 S.Ct. 1932 (An exercise of the judicial power is required `when the government wants to act authoritatively upon core private rights that had vested in a particular individual' (quoting C.

2022-015,80,"The requirement of plenary Article III adjudication of private rights began to change in the early 20th century. As notions of administrative efficiency came into vogue, courts were viewed less as guardians of core private rights and more as impediments to expert administrative adjudication. See 20 F.4th 194, 219 (CA5 2021) (Oldham, J., concurring). After his election in 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, who shared the progressive faith in administrative expertise, sought to rein in judicial review of administrative action. Merrill 955. This progressive sentiment led to the Hepburn Act, 34 Stat. 584, which was designed to curb judicial review of Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) rate orders. Prior to the Hepburn Act, the ICC was required to file a bill of equity in court to obtain judicial enforcement of its rate orders. Merrill 955. But, the Hepburn Act provided that the ICC's orders were to be self-executing thirty days after they became final, unless `suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction'—almost inverting the traditional system. Ibid. (quoting 34 Stat. 589). While the Act was silent on the standard of review, this Court understood the implied threat that if it did not back off from its aggressive review practices, more drastic action would be in the offing. Merrill 959.",Thomas,0,
2022-015,81,"Accordingly, the Court began to develop what is now known as the appellate review model. See id., at 963-965. While maintaining that the courts must decide all relevant questions of constitutional power or right and other questions of law, ICC v. Illinois Central R. Co., 215 U.S. 452, 470, 30 S.Ct. 155, 54 L.Ed. 280 (1910), the Court held that an ICC order supported by evidence must be accepted as final, ICC v. Union Pacific R. Co., 222 U.S. 541, 547, 32 S.Ct. 108, 56 L.Ed. 308 (1912). Following the Court's lead, Congress codified the appellate review model in the two statutes at issue here. The Federal Trade Commission Act provided that the findings of the commission as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall in like manner be conclusive in federal court. 38 Stat. 720 (codified, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. § 45(c)). The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 likewise provided that  the SEC's findings shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 48 Stat. 902 (codified, as amended, at 15 U.S.C. § 78y).",Thomas,0,
2022-015,82,"In the 1930s, this Court upheld the constitutionality of the appellate review model against arguments that it violated the separation of powers and Seventh Amendment. First, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932), the Court examined the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, which authorized administrative agencies to adjudicate workers' compensation claims against private parties. The Court acknowledged that the case was one of private right, id., at 51, 52 S.Ct. 285, but held that Congress had the authority to place primary factfinding authority in an administrative agency, id., at 54, 52 S.Ct. 285. It reasoned that such a scheme did not violate Article III because Congress has considerable power to structure judicial proceedings and to regulate the mechanisms that courts use to ascertain facts. Nelson 600.",Thomas,0,
2022-015,83,"Next, in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893 (1937), the Court examined the National Labor Relations Act's judicial review provisions, which required an Article III court to accept the National Labor Relations Board's factual findings so long as they were supported by evidence in the administrative record. 49 Stat. 454. The Court held that this arrangement did not violate the Seventh Amendment, which provides that in Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. The Court reasoned that, because claims seeking statutory remedies for violations of the Act were `statutory proceedings' that were `unknown to the common law,' they were not `suits at common law' within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment. Nelson 602 (quoting Jones & Laughlin, 301 U.S. at 48, 57 S.Ct. 615, alterations omitted). These cases solidified administrative agencies' authority to act as factfinding adjuncts to the federal judiciary on a broad array of statutory claims, including claims for monetary relief. Nelson 602.3",Thomas,0,
2022-015,85,"As I have previously explained, because federal administrative agencies are part of the Executive Branch, it is not clear that they have power to adjudicate claims involving core private rights. B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 171, 135 S.Ct. 1293, 191 L.Ed.2d 222 (2015) (dissenting opinion). The appellate review model of agency adjudication thus raises serious constitutional concerns. It may violate the separation of powers by placing adjudicatory authority over core private rights—a judicial rather than executive power—within the authority of Article II agencies. See ibid. (To the extent that administrative agencies could, consistent with the Constitution, function as courts, they might only be able to do so with respect to claims involving public or quasi-private rights). It may  violate Article III by compelling the Judiciary to defer to administrative agencies regarding matters within the core of the Judicial Vesting Clause. See P. Hamburger, Is Administrative Law Unlawful? 297 (2014) (Hamburger) (explaining that, traditionally, even at the behest of Congress, the judges could not defer to the executive record or the facts supposedly established by it, lest they abandon their office of independent judgment and the office of juries to decide the facts). And, it may violate due process by empowering entities that are not courts of competent jurisdiction to deprive citizens of core private rights. See B&B Hardware, 575 U.S. at 164, 135 S.Ct. 1293 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (However broadly `court of competent jurisdiction' was defined, it would require quite a leap to say that the concept encompasses administrative agencies, which were recognized as categorically different from courts (alteration omitted)), see also Hamburger 256 (The guarantee of due process . bars the government from holding subjects to account outside courts and their processes). Finally, the appellate review model may run afoul of the Seventh Amendment by allowing an administrative agency to adjudicate what may be core private rights without a jury. See Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 417, 107 S.Ct. 1831, 95 L.Ed.2d 365 (1987) (explaining that the Seventh Amendment ensures the right to a jury trial for all adjudications analogous to `Suits at common law').",Thomas,0,
2022-015,86,"It is no answer that an Article III court may eventually review the agency order and its factual findings under a deferential standard of review. In fact, there seems to be no basis for treating factfinding differently from deciding questions of law. Both are at the core of judicial power, as Article III itself acknowledges. See § 2, cl. 2 (providing that this Court's appellate jurisdiction is both as to Law and Fact), see also Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 484, 131 S.Ct. 2594, 180 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011). For much of the Nation's history, it was understood that Article III precluded the political branches from exercising power over the determination of individualized adjudicative facts when core private rights were at stake. Nelson 593 (emphasis deleted), see also Hamburger 297. It is obvious that Article III would not be satisfied if Congress provided for judicial review but ordered the courts to affirm the agency no matter what. G. Lawson, The Rise and Rise of the Administrative State, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1231, 1247 (1994) (Lawson). And, there is no reason to think that it is any different if Congress instead simply orders courts to put a thumb (or perhaps two forearms) on the agency's side of the scale. Id., at 1247-1248. Such a regime allows a mere party to supplant a jury as the court's fact finder, Hamburger 319, and it effectively vests the judicial power either in the agency or in Congress, Lawson 1247. It thus appears likely that, when agency adjudicators stray outside the proper limits of executive adjudication such as by depriving individuals of vested property rights, they must not serve even as fact-finders subject to judicial deference. Mascott 25 (footnote omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-015,87,"In sum, whether any form of administrative adjudication is constitutionally permissible likely turns on the nature of the right in question. If private rights are at stake, the Constitution likely requires plenary Article III adjudication. Conversely, if privileges or public rights are at stake, Congress likely can foreclose judicial review at will.",Thomas,0,
2022-015,89,"The rights at issue in these cases appear to be core private rights that must be adjudicated by Article III courts. For one, Axon and Cochran face the threat of significant monetary fines. Indeed, in the first  round of proceedings, the SEC imposed a $22,500 civil penalty on Cochran. And, the FTC seeks to require Axon to transfer intellectual property to another entity. These types of penalties and orders implicate the core private right to property. See Lawson 1247 (imposition of a civil penalty or fine implicates core Article III power), see also Nelson 626-627. Accordingly, they likely must be adjudicated by Article III courts and juries. See Tull, 481 U.S. at 422, 107 S.Ct. 1831 (A civil penalty was a type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in courts of law), accord, id., at 427-428, 107 S.Ct. 1831 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Naturally, merely labeling the deprivation of a core private right a civil penalty cannot allow Congress and agencies to circumvent constitutional requirements. Cf. Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 61, 109 S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989) (Congress cannot eliminate a party's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial merely by relabeling the cause of action to which it attaches and placing exclusive jurisdiction in an administrative agency or a specialized court of equity). By permitting administrative agencies to adjudicate what may be core private rights, the administrative review schemes here raise serious constitutional issues.* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-015,90,"Because the Court today correctly holds that Axon's and Cochran's claims are not precluded by the review-channeling provisions at issue here, I join its opinion in full.

2022-015,94,"The Constitution vests in Congress the power to create and organize lower federal courts. See Art. I, § 8, cl. 9, Art. III, § 1, Sheldon v.

Exercising that power, for the last 150 years Congress has afforded lower federal courts jurisdiction to hear civil disputes arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 137, § 1, 18 Stat. 470, see also Act of Dec. 1, 1980, 94 Stat. 2369 (eliminating amount-in-controversy requirement).

2022-015,95,"Not so fast. As the Court sees it, Ms. Cochran, Axon, and others like them must satisfy not only § 1331. They must also satisfy a judge-made, multi-factor balancing test.

Ante, at 900. So, yes, the law on the books may promise you the right to be heard in a court of law. But sometimes that doesn't count for much. Sometimes judges can shunt you to an agency instead—so long as a test we have fabricated suggests to us that is what Congress really wanted.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,96,"There are many problems with the Thunder Basin project, but start with its sheer incoherence. At the outset, Thunder Basin requires litigants and courts to ask whether a `comprehensive review process' exists. Ante, at 900. What does that mean? It seems a review process will typically qualify as comprehensive when review in a court of appeals follows the agency's own review. Ibid. But typically does not mean necessarily. Ibid. Just because an agency can hear a case does not mean a district court cannot. To decide whether a particular case belongs in an agency rather than a court, you must consult three further considerations  commonly known now as the Thunder Basin factors. Ante, at 900-901.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,97,"That's where the magic happens. The Thunder Basin factors require assessing whether: (1) precluding district court jurisdiction would foreclose all meaningful judicial review, (2) the plaintiff's claims are wholly collateral to the statutory review scheme, and (3) the claims are outside the agency's expertise. Ante, at 900-901 (internal quotation marks omitted), see generally 510 U.S. at 207-215, 114 S.Ct. 771.

See ante, at 900-902.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,98,"Just see how easy it is. To apply the first factor, all you have to do is ask a few more questions. They include whether the plaintiff could eventually obtain review in some federal court, whether that court's review would come too late to be meaningful, and (maybe) how analogous the plaintiff's plea for immediate review is to a governmental official's plea for qualified immunity. Ante, at 902-904. If this is starting to seem more confounding than clarifying, do not worry. The first factor is the least straightforward anyway. Ante, at 902. When it comes to the second factor, you only need to evaluate the collateralism of the plaintiff's claim. Ante, at 904. Apparently, that requires considering the nature of the claim, not the status (pending or not) of an agency proceeding. Ante, at 905. The third factor is just one easy question too, focused on whether the plaintiff's claim is intertwined with or embedded in matters on which the agency is expert. Ante, at 906.

2022-015,101,"Putting aside these problems with the Thunder Basin project serves only to expose  others. We are told that consulting so many disparate factors is essential if we are to divine and give effect to implicit congressional intentions to divest district courts of jurisdiction in favor of certain agency proceedings.

2022-015,102,"The answer, of course, is nothing. Under our Constitution, Congress, and not the Judiciary, defines the scope of federal jurisdiction. New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 359, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989). Federal courts have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 404, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court). That is why we have called it the true rule that statutes clearly defining the jurisdiction of the courts  must control  in the absence of subsequent legislation equally express. Rosencrans v. United States, 165 U.S. 257, 262, 17 S.Ct. 302, 41 L.Ed. 708 (1897).

2022-015,103,"Thunder Basin defies these foundational rules. Maybe worse, it exhibits familiarity with none of them. No one disputes that § 1331 represents a valid exercise of Congress's authority to regulate the jurisdiction of the district courts. No one questions that § 1331 permits cases like those before us to proceed. No Member of the Court points to any statute Congress has adopted that speaks otherwise. Under the law, that should be the end of the matter. But under Thunder Basin, courts may refuse individuals their right to a judicial forum based on nothing more than suppositions about implicit congressional intentions. Ante, at 900. Divesting jurisdiction by mere implication goes from out-of-bounds to the name of the game. Along the way, this Court arrogates to itself a power to control the jurisdiction of lower federal courts that the Constitution reserves to Congress.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,104,"All to what end? At bottom, Thunder Basin rests on a view that it is sometimes more important to allow agencies to work without the bother of having to answer suits against them than it is to allow individuals their day in court. But when Congress holds that view, it does not ask us to juggle a variety of factors and then guess at the implicit intentions of legislators past. It simply tells us. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 1818(i)(1) (Except as otherwise provided in this section or under section 1831o or 1831p-1 of this title no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order under any such section), 42 U.S.C. § 405(h) (No action against the United States, the Commissioner of Social Security, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter).2  III",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,105,"There is a better way. Our job is to interpret the laws Congress has adopted.

Because no one doubts that § 1331 vests district courts with jurisdiction to hear these cases, the only question properly before us is whether Congress has actually carved out some exception in some other statute. The government points to two candidates. But the government's arguments from those laws are so improbable that the Court barely mentions them. I pause to walk through each only to illustrate how these cases should have been resolved.",Gorsuch,0,

That provision says that a person aggrieved by a final order of the Commission  may obtain review of the order in the United States Court of Appeals  by filing in such court  a written petition requesting that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part. 15 U.S.C. § 78y(a)(1). Plainly, the statute promises jurisdiction in a court of appeals for those hoping to contest a final order of the Commission. But just as plainly, Ms. Cochran does not seek to challenge an SEC final order. Nor could she, because the agency has not entered one in her case. Ms. Cochran does not even seek relief in anticipation of a final agency order. Instead, she seeks to avoid being hauled before an agency that she alleges is unconstitutionally structured. See ante, at 898-899. That is exactly the kind of here-and-now injury this Court has held can be remedied by a court without regard to the eventual outcome of agency proceedings. Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2183, 2196, 207 L.Ed.2d 494 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,107,"If all that were not enough, there is more. A neighboring statutory provision says that the rights and remedies the Exchange Act authorizes shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity. § 78bb(a)(2). This Court has explained that a saving clause of this sort strongly buttresses the conclusion that a review provision such as § 78y(a)(1) does not preclude traditional avenues of judicial relief. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 142, 144, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). And, of course, one traditional avenue of relief is a suit in district court under § 1331 seeking to enjoin unconstitutional conduct. See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491, n. 2, 130 S.Ct. 3138, 177 L.Ed.2d 706 (2010). Far from barring Ms. Cochran's path to court, then, the Exchange Act expressly preserves it.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,108,"The story repeats itself when it comes to Axon. The government insists that § 5(c)  of the FTC Act precludes district courts from entertaining constitutional challenges to the agency's structure. But § 5(c) provides only that parties subject to an order of the Commission to cease and desist from using any method of competition or act or practice may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of the United States. 15 U.S.C. § 45(c). And, here again, we have nothing like that. The FTC has not ordered Axon to cease and desist from anything. That § 5(c) does not foreclose Axon's case finds reinforcement next door too. Section 5(d) holds that, upon the filing of the record  the jurisdiction of the court of appeals of the United States to affirm, enforce, modify, or set aside orders of the Commission shall be exclusive. § 45(d). So until an administrative record is lodged in the court of appeals— something that hasn't happened here either —the appellate court's jurisdiction is not exclusive and a plaintiff like Axon remains free to proceed in district court.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,109,"In both cases, the relevant statutes guide the way. Section 1331 grants district courts the power to hear Ms. Cochran's and Axon's claims and no other law takes that power away. Resolving jurisdictional disputes by looking to the terms of the statutes Congress has adopted may hold none of the suspense that comes with a ride on the Thunder Basin roller coaster. But that is as it should be. Where the statutory language is clear, our sole function is to enforce it according to its terms. Rake v. Wade, 508 U.S. 464, 471, 113 S.Ct. 2187, 124 L.Ed.2d 424 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).3",Gorsuch,0,

Richardson, 457 U.S. 668, 676-677, 102 S.Ct. 2654, 73 L.Ed.2d 300 (1982). For parties, complex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up time and money as they litigate, not the merits of their claims, but which court is the right court to decide those claims. Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 175  L.Ed.2d 1029 (2010). For courts, jurisdictional rules mark the bounds of their `adjudicatory authority.' Boechler v. Commissioner, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1493, 1497, 212 L.Ed.2d 524 (2022). Judges therefore benefit from straightforward rules under which they can readily assure themselves of their power to hear a case, Hertz, 559 U.S. at 94, 130 S.Ct. 1181, while adventitious rules leave them with almost impossible tasks to perform that squander their limited resources, Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v.

2022-015,113,"There are many words to describe the Thunder Basin factors, but clear and easy to apply are not among them.

2022-015,114,"A single mother of two and a certified public accountant, Ms. Cochran began looking for part-time work in 2007. Eventually, she found a position at a small company called The Hall Group. Soon, however, she discovered that the owner, David Hall, was not just abrasive but dishonest. At one point, he even added Ms. Cochran's name to the firm's business license without her permission, all to facilitate his idea of rebranding his company as The Hall Group CPAs. When Ms. Cochran protested, Mr. Hall offered her a choice: become a nonequity partner with no increase in pay so that he could use the new name or leave the firm. Ms. Cochran chose to quit and put the whole ordeal behind her.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,115,"Or so she thought. Years later, in 2016, Ms. Cochran learned that the SEC had initiated an enforcement proceeding against Mr. Hall, another of his former employees, and herself. The SEC charged Ms. Cochran with violating Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting Rule 2-02(b)(1) violations. In re Hall, SEC Release No. 3-17228, p. 1 (2017). In English, the SEC alleged that Ms. Cochran had failed to complete auditing checklists, leaving certain sections of certain forms blank. Id., at 12-13. The agency brought these charges even though there was no evidence that the incomplete paperwork had resulted in any monetary harm to clients or investors. Id., at 28.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,116,"The SEC elected to proceed against Ms. Cochran before its own internal tribunal rather than (as it could have) a court of law. The agency assigned the case to one of its hearing officers (an administrative law judge or ALJ). Reportedly, that ALJ made a practice of warning defendants during settlement discussions that he had never ruled against the agency's enforcement division. J. Eaglesham, SEC Judges' Fairness Is in Spotlight, Wall St. J., Nov. 23, 2015, p. C6. It seems, though, Ms. Cochran didn't take the hint. She refused to settle and sought to represent herself in the hearing that followed. It did not go well. Just as her hearing was about to start, her former boss settled his own case and then turned about to testify against Ms. Cochran. In the end, the ALJ fined Ms. Cochran $22,500 and banned her from practicing before the SEC as an accountant for at least five years.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,117,"Ms. Cochran responded by asking the full Commission to review the ALJ's decision. Around the same time, this Court held in an unrelated case that the ALJ who presided over Ms. Cochran's case had been unconstitutionally appointed. See Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 2044, 2050, 201 L.Ed.2d 464 (2018). Ms. Cochran might have thought that would  bring her own case to a close. But the SEC chose instead to take a mulligan. In 2018, the agency vacated the initial decision against Ms. Cochran and assigned a different, properly appointed ALJ to retry the case. So two years after her administrative proceedings began, they began again.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,118,"For Ms. Cochran, that was enough. She sued the SEC in federal district court. She sought to enjoin the agency's proceedings on the ground that all of its ALJs are unconstitutionally insulated from presidential supervision, pointing to this Court's decisions in Lucia and Free Enterprise Fund. Lucia held that SEC ALJs are inferior officers under the Constitution's Appointments Clause. 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct. at 2059-2060.

2022-015,119,"In 2019, the district court dismissed Ms. Cochran's suit without reaching its merits. Cochran v. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2019 WL 1359252 (ND Tex., Mar. 25, 2019). The court did so because it thought Thunder Basin required that result. Id., at *1. A year and a half later, a panel of the Fifth Circuit ran through the Thunder Basin factors and affirmed. 969 F.3d 507 (2020). A year and a half after that, the en banc Fifth Circuit took another look and largely reversed. 20 F.4th 194 (2021). Now, more than four years after Ms. Cochran filed her complaint, this Court balances the Thunder Basin factors anew and holds that her case belonged in district court all along. Ante, at 905-906. For its part, Axon has endured a similarly tortuous path. Over the course of three years, the district court dismissed its case, 452 F.Supp.3d 882 (Ariz. 2020), and the court of appeals affirmed, 986 F.3d 1173 (CA9 2021), only to have this Court reverse that judgment today.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,120,"This is what a win looks like under Thunder Basin. When you replace clear jurisdictional rules with a jumble of factors, the room for disagreement grows. The incentive to litigate increases. Years and fortunes are lost just figuring out where a case belongs. Ms. Cochran and Axon have already endured multi-year odysseys through the entire federal judicial system—and no judge yet has breathed a word about the merits of their claims. Nor can I fault the district court in Ms. Cochran's case, or all of the lower courts in Axon's case, for thinking the Thunder Basin factors required dismissal. When we give our lower-court colleagues such confused instructions, we guarantee different courts will regularly reach different outcomes on the same facts.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-015,121,"Maybe even worse is what Thunder Basin means for others. Not many possess the perseverance of Ms. Cochran and Axon. The cost, time, and uncertainty associated with litigating a raft of opaque jurisdictional factors will deter many people from even trying to reach the court of law to which they are entitled. Nor is the loss of a day in court in favor of one before an agency a small thing. Agencies like the SEC and FTC combine the functions of investigator, prosecutor, and judge under one roof. They employ relaxed rules of procedure and evidence—rules they make for themselves. The numbers reveal just how tilted this game is. From 2010 to 2015, the SEC won 90% of its contested in-house proceedings compared to 69% of the cases it brought in federal court. See G. Mark, Response: SEC Enforcement Discretion, 94 Texas L. Rev. 261, 262 (2016). Meanwhile, some say the FTC has not lost an in-house proceeding in 25 years. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 21-86, p. 47.

2022-015,122,"That review is available in a court of appeals after an agency completes its work hardly makes up for a day in court before an agency says it's done. When a case eventually makes its way to an appellate court, judges sometimes defer to the agency's conclusions (especially when it comes to disputed questions of fact). And how many people can afford to carry a case that far anyway? Ms. Cochran's administrative proceedings have already dragged on for seven years. Thanks in part to these realities, the bulk of agency cases settle. See Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 298, n. 5 (CA2 2016) (Droney, J., dissenting) (vast majority of SEC cases settle), Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21-1239, p. 6 (more than 90 percent of such cases settle). Aware, too, that few can outlast or outspend the federal government, agencies sometimes use this as leverage to extract settlement terms they could not lawfully obtain any other way.4 Like any needlessly unclear jurisdictional test, Thunder Basin carries with it real costs—for individuals seeking to vindicate their rights, for lower courts who deserve better guidance, and for our legal system's promise of a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every case, Fed.

But, no, the court held, Mr. Mallory could not invoke that law because it violates the Due Process Clause. Id., at 564-568.

That principle applied to all kinds of actions, but cashed out differently based on the object of the court's attention. So, for example, an action in rem that claimed an interest in immovable property was usually treated as a local action that could be brought only in the jurisdiction where the property was located. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 117-118, 294 (1768). Meanwhile, an in personam suit against an individual for injuries that might have happened any where was generally considered a transitory action that followed the individual. Id., at 294.

2022-016,37,"American courts routinely followed these rules.

Massie v. Watts, 6 Cranch 148, 162-163, 10 U.S. 148, 3 L.Ed. 181 (1810).

2022-016,39,"As the use of the corporate form proliferated in the 19th century, the question arose how to adapt the traditional rule about transitory actions for individuals to artificial persons created by law.

2022-016,40,"Lawmakers across the country soon responded to these stratagems. Relevant here, both before and after the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, they adopted statutes requiring out-of-state corporations to consent to in-state suits in exchange for the rights to exploit the local market and to receive the full range of benefits enjoyed by in-state corporations. These statutes varied. In some States, out-of-state corporate defendants were required to agree to answer suits brought by in-state plaintiffs. See, e.g., N. Y. Code Proc. § 427 (1849), 1866 Wis. Laws ch. 1, § 86.1, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 26, § 211 (1868), N. C. Gen. Stat., ch. 17, § 82 (1873). In other States, corporations were required to consent to suit if the plaintiff's cause of action arose within the State, even if the plaintiff happened to reside elsewhere. See, e.g., Iowa Code, ch. 101, § 1705 (1851), 1874 Tex. Gen. Laws p. 107, 1881 Mich. Pub. Acts p. 348. Still other States (and the federal government) omitted both of these limitations. They required all out-of-state corporations that registered to do business in the forum to agree to defend themselves there against any manner of suit. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 22, 1867, 14 Stat. 404, 1889 Nev. Stats. p. 47, S. C. Rev. Stat., Tit. 7, ch. 45, § 1466 (1894), Conn. Gen. Stat. § 3931 (1895). Yet another group of States applied this all-purpose-jurisdiction rule to a subset of corporate defendants, like railroads and insurance companies. See, e.g., 1827 Va. Acts ch. 74, p. 77, 1841 Pa. Laws p. 29, 1854 Ohio Laws p. 91, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 112, § 68 (1855), Ark. Stat., ch. 76, § 3561 (1873), Mo. Rev. Stat., ch. 119, Art. 4, § 6013 (1879).

Ibid. When Gold Issue Mining sought to collect on its policy, Pennsylvania Fire refused to pay. So, Gold Issue Mining sued.

Id., at 543, 184 S.W. at 1003 (internal quotation marks omitted). For more than a decade, Pennsylvania Fire had complied with the law, as it had desired to transact business in Missouri pursuant to the laws thereof. Id., at 545, 184 S.W. at 1003. And Gold Issue Mining had served process on the appropriate state official, just as the law required. See id., at 535, 184 S.W. at 1000.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,47,"As to the law's constitutionality, the Missouri Supreme Court carefully reviewed this Court's precedents and found they clearly supported sustaining the proceeding. Id., at 569, 576, 184 S.W. at 1010, 1013, see id., at 552-576, 601, 184 S.W. at 1005-1013, 1020-1021. The Missouri Supreme Court explained that its decision was also supported by the origin, growth, and history of transitory actions in England, and their importation, adoption, and expansion in America. Id., at 578-586, 184 S.W. at 1013-1016. It stressed, too, that the law had long permitted suits against individuals in any jurisdiction where they could be found, no matter where the underlying cause of action happened to arise. What sense would it make to treat a fictitious corporate person differently? See id., at 588-592, 600, 184 S.W. at 1016-1018, 1020. For all these reasons, the court concluded, Pennsylvania Fire had due process of law, regardless of the place, state or nation where the cause of action arose. Id., at 576, 184 S.W. at 1013.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,48,"Dissatisfied with this answer, Pennsylvania Fire turned here. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Holmes had little trouble dispatching the company's due process argument. Under this Court's precedents, there was no doubt Pennsylvania Fire could be sued in Missouri by an out-of-state plaintiff on an out-of-state contract because it had agreed to accept service of process in Missouri on any suit as a condition of doing business there. Pennsylvania Fire, 243 U.S. at 95, 37 S.Ct. 344. Indeed, the Court thought the matter so settled by existing law that the case hardly presented an open question. Ibid. The Court acknowledged that the outcome might have been different if the corporation had never appointed an agent for service of process in Missouri, given this Court's earlier decision in Old Wayne Mut. Life Assn. of Indianapolis v. McDonough, 204 U.S. 8, 27 S.Ct. 236, 51 L.Ed. 345 (1907). But the Court thought that Old Wayne had left untouched the principle that due process allows a corporation to be sued on any claim in a State where it has appointed an agent to receive whatever suits may come. 243 U.S. at 95-96, 37 S.Ct. 344. The Court found it unnecessary to say more because the company's objections had been resolved  at length in the judgment of the court below. Id., at 95, 37 S.Ct. 344.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,49,"That assessment was understandable. Not only had the Missouri Supreme Court issued a thoughtful opinion. Not only did a similar rule apply to transitory actions against individuals. Other leading judges, including Learned Hand and Benjamin Cardozo, had reached similar conclusions in similar cases in the years leading up to Pennsylvania Fire. See Smolik v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 222 F. 148, 150-151 (SDNY 1915) (Hand, J.), Bagdon v.

In the years following Pennsylvania Fire, too, this Court reaffirmed its holding as often as the issue arose. See, e.g., Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Chatters, 279 U.S. 320, 325-326, 49 S.Ct. 329, 73 L.Ed. 711 (1929), Neirbo Co. v.

2022-016,51,"Pennsylvania Fire controls this case. Much like the Missouri law at issue there, the Pennsylvania law at issue here provides that an out-of-state corporation may not do business in this Commonwealth until it registers with the Department of State. 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 411(a). As part of the registration process, a corporation must identify an office it will continuously maintain in the Commonwealth. § 411(f), see also § 412(a)(5). Upon completing these requirements, the corporation shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as a domestic entity and shall be subject to the same liabilities, restrictions, duties and penalties  imposed on domestic entities. § 402(d). Among other things, Pennsylvania law is explicit that qualification as a foreign corporation shall permit state courts to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a registered foreign corporation, just as they can over domestic corporations. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5301(a)(2)(i).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,52,"Norfolk Southern has complied with this law for many years. In 1998, the company registered to do business in Pennsylvania. Acting through its Corporate Secretary as a duly authorized officer, the company completed an Application for Certificate of Authority from the Commonwealth in compliance with state law. App. 1-2. As part of that process, the company named a Commercial Registered Office Provider in Philadelphia County, agreeing that this was where it shall be deemed located. Ibid. The Secretary of the Commonwealth approved the application, conferring on Norfolk Southern both the benefits and burdens shared by domestic corporations—including amenability to suit in state court on any claim. Id., at 1. Since 1998, Norfolk Southern has regularly updated its information on file with the Secretary. In 2009, for example, the company advised that it had changed its Registered Office Provider and would now be deemed located in Dauphin County. Id., at 6, see 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 4144(b) (1988). All told, then, Norfolk Southern has agreed to be found in Pennsylvania and answer any suit there for more than 20 years.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,53,"Pennsylvania Fire held that suits premised on these grounds do not deny a defendant due process of law. Even Norfolk Southern does not seriously dispute that much. It concedes that it registered to do business in Pennsylvania, that it established an office there to receive service of process, and that in doing so it understood it would be amenable to suit on any claim.",Gorsuch,0,

Of course, Mr. Mallory no longer lives in Pennsylvania and his cause of action did not accrue there. But none of that makes any more difference than the fact that Gold Issue Mining was not from Missouri (but from Arizona) and its claim did not arise there (but in Colorado). See Pennsylvania Fire, 267 Mo. at 537, 184 S.W. at 1001. To decide this case, we need not speculate whether any other statutory scheme and set of facts would suffice to establish consent to suit. It is enough to acknowledge that the state law and facts before us fall squarely within Pennsylvania Fire's rule. See post, at 2047-2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,55,"In the proceedings below, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court seemed to recognize that Pennsylvania Fire dictated an answer in Mr. Mallory's favor. Still, it ruled for Norfolk Southern anyway. It did so because, in its view, intervening decisions from this Court had implicitly overruled Pennsylvania Fire. See 266 A.3d at 559, 567. But in following that course, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court clearly erred. As this Court has explained: If a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, as Pennsylvania Fire does here, a lower court should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions. Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989).

2022-016,57,"Now before us, Norfolk Southern candidly asks us to do what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could not—overrule Pennsylvania Fire. Brief for Respondent 36-38. To smooth the way, Norfolk Southern suggests that this Court's decision in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), has already done much of the hard work for us. That decision, the company insists, seriously undermined Pennsylvania Fire's foundations. Brief for Respondent 34-36. We disagree. The two precedents sit comfortably side by side. See post, at 2048-2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,59,"Start with how Norfolk Southern sees things. On the company's telling, echoed by the dissent, International Shoe held that the Due Process Clause tolerates two (and only two) types of personal jurisdiction over a corporate defendant. First, specific jurisdiction permits suits that `arise out of or relate to' a corporate defendant's activities in the forum State. Ford Motor Co., 592 U. S., at ___ - ___ 141 S.Ct., at 1024-1025. Second, general  jurisdiction allows all kinds of suits against a corporation, but only in States where the corporation is incorporated or has its principal place of business. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1024. After International Shoe, Norfolk Southern insists, no other bases for personal jurisdiction over a corporate defendant are permissible. Brief for Respondent 13-15, see post, at 2055-2057 (BARRETT, J., dissenting).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,60,"But if this account might seem a plausible summary of some of our International Shoe jurisprudence, it oversimplifies matters. Here is what really happened in International Shoe. The State of Washington sued a corporate defendant in state court for claims based on its in-state activities even though the defendant had not registered to do business in Washington and had not agreed to be present and accept service of process there. 326 U.S. at 312-313, 66 S.Ct. 154. Despite this, the Court held that the suit against the company comported with due process. In doing so, the Court reasoned that the Fourteenth Amendment permits suits against a corporate defendant that has not agreed to be present within the territorial jurisdiction of a court, so long as the quality and nature of the company's activity in the State make it reasonable and just to maintain suit there. Id., at 316, 319-320, 66 S.Ct. 154. Put simply, even without agreeing to be present, the out-of-state corporation was still amenable to suit in Washington consistent with `fair play and substantial justice'—terms the Court borrowed from Justice Holmes, the author of Pennsylvania Fire. International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154 (citing McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U.S. 90, 91-92, 37 S.Ct. 343, 61 L.Ed. 608 (1917)).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,61,"In reality, then, all International Shoe did was stake out an additional road to jurisdiction over out-of-state corporations. Pennsylvania Fire held that an out-of-state corporation that has consented to in-state suits in order to do business in the forum is susceptible to suit there. International Shoe held that an out-of-state corporation that has not consented to in-state suits may also be susceptible to claims in the forum State based on the quality and nature of its activity in the forum. 326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154. Consistent with all this, our precedents applying International Shoe have long spoken of the decision as asking whether a state court may exercise jurisdiction over a corporate defendant `that has not consented to suit in the forum.' Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 927-928, 131 S.Ct. 2846, 180 L.Ed.2d 796 (2011) (emphasis added), see also Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 129, 134 S.Ct. 746, 187 L.Ed.2d 624 (2014). Our precedents have recognized, too, that express or implied consent can continue to ground personal jurisdiction—and consent may be manifested in various ways by word or deed. See, e.g., Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982), BNSF R. Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.S. 402, 415, 137 S.Ct. 1549, 198 L.Ed.2d 36 (2017). See also post, at 2048-2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.).6",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,62,"That Norfolk Southern overreads International Shoe finds confirmation in that decision's emphasis on `fair play and substantial justice.' 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154. Sometimes, International Shoe said, the nature of a company's in-state activities will support jurisdiction over a nonconsenting  corporation when those activities give rise to the liabilities sued on. Id., at 317, 66 S.Ct. 154. Other times, it added, suits on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from the company's activities in the forum State may be appropriate. Id., at 318, 66 S.Ct. 154. These passages may have pointed the way to what (much) later cases would label specific jurisdiction over claims related to in-forum activities and general jurisdiction in places where a corporation is incorporated or headquartered. See, e.g., Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414-415, and nn. 8-9, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984). But the fact remains that International Shoe itself eschewed any mechanical or quantitative test and instead endorsed a flexible approach focused on the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure. 326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154. Unquestionably, too, International Shoe saw this flexible standard as expanding— not contracting—state court jurisdiction. See Daimler, 571 U.S. at 128, and n. 6, 134 S.Ct. 746. As we later put the point: The immediate effect of International Shoe was to increase the ability of the state courts to obtain personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,63,"Given all this, it is no wonder that we have already turned aside arguments very much like Norfolk Southern's. In Burnham, the defendant contended that International Shoe implicitly overruled the traditional tag rule holding that individuals physically served in a State are subject to suit there for claims of any kind. 495 U.S. at 616, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (plurality opinion). This Court rejected that submission. Instead, as Justice Scalia explained, International Shoe simply provided a novel way to secure personal jurisdiction that did nothing to displace other traditional ones. Id., at 619, 110 S.Ct. 2105. What held true there must hold true here. Indeed, seven years after deciding International Shoe, the Court cited Pennsylvania Fire approvingly. Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 446, n. 6, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485 (1952).7",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,65,"Norfolk Southern offers several replies, but none persuades. The company begins by pointing to this Court's decision in Shaffer. There, as the company stresses, the Court indicated that `prior decisions inconsistent with' International Shoe `are overruled.' Brief for Respondent 35 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U.S. at 212, n. 39, 97 S.Ct. 2569), post, at 2062-2063 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). True as that statement may be, however, it only poses the question whether Pennsylvania Fire is inconsistent  with International Shoe. And, as we have seen, it is not. Instead, the latter decision expanded upon the traditional grounds of personal jurisdiction recognized by the former. This Court has previously cautioned litigants and lower courts against (mis)reading Shaffer as suggesting that International Shoe discarded every traditional method for securing personal jurisdiction that came before. See Burnham, 495 U.S. at 620-622, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (plurality opinion), cf. Daimler, 571 U.S. at 126, 132-133, 134 S.Ct. 746. We find ourselves repeating the admonition today.8",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,66,"Next, Norfolk Southern appeals to the spirit of our age. After International Shoe, it says, the primary concern of the personal jurisdiction analysis is treating defendants fairly. Brief for Respondent 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). And on the company's telling, it would be unfair to allow Mr. Mallory's suit to proceed in Pennsylvania because doing so would risk unleashing `local prejudice' against a company that is not `local' in the eyes of the community. Id., at 19-21.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,67,"But if fairness is what Norfolk Southern seeks, pause for a moment to measure this suit against that standard. When Mr. Mallory brought his claim in 2017, Norfolk Southern had registered to do business in Pennsylvania for many years. It had established an office for receiving service of process. It had done so pursuant to a statute that gave the company the right to do business in-state in return for agreeing to answer any suit against it. And the company had taken full advantage of its opportunity to do business in the Commonwealth, boasting of its presence this way:",Gorsuch,0,

2022-016,69,"All told, when Mr. Mallory sued, Norfolk Southern employed nearly 5,000 people in Pennsylvania. It maintained more than 2,400 miles of track across the Commonwealth. Its 70-acre locomotive shop there  was the largest in North America. Contrary to what it says in its brief here, the company even proclaimed itself a proud part of the Pennsylvania Community. Ibid. By 2020, too, Norfolk Southern managed more miles of track in Pennsylvania than in any other State. Brief for Public Citizen as Amicus Curiae 21. And it employed more people in Pennsylvania than it did in Virginia, where its headquarters was located. Ibid. Nor are we conjuring these statistics out of thin air. The company itself highlighted its intrastate activities in the proceedings below. 266 A.3d at 560, 563 (discussing the firm's extensive operations in Pennsylvania, including 2,278 miles of track, eleven rail yards, and three locomotive repair shops). Given all this, on what plausible account could International Shoe's concerns with fair play and substantial justice require a Pennsylvania court to turn aside Mr. Mallory's suit? See post, at 2048-2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.).9",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,70,"Perhaps sensing its arguments from fairness meet a dead end, Norfolk Southern ultimately heads in another direction altogether. It suggests the Due Process Clause separately prohibits one State from infringing on the sovereignty of another State through exorbitant claims of personal jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 16-19, see post, at 2057-2059 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). And, in candor, the company is half right. Some of our personal jurisdiction cases have discussed the federalism implications of one State's assertion of jurisdiction over the corporate residents of another. See, e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., San Francisco Cty., 582 U.S. 255, 263, 137 S.Ct. 1773, 198 L.Ed.2d 395 (2017). But that neglects an important part of the story. To date, our personal jurisdiction cases have never found a Due Process Clause problem sounding in federalism when an out-of-state defendant submits to suit in the forum State. After all, personal jurisdiction is a personal defense that may be waived or forfeited. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704-705, 102 S.Ct. 2099, see also post, at 2050-2051 (opinion of ALITO, J.), post, at 2045-2046 (opinion of JACKSON, J.).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,71,"That leaves Norfolk Southern one final stand. It argues that it has not really submitted to proceedings in Pennsylvania. Brief for Respondent 11-13, see post, at 2057-2058, 2058-2059 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). The company does not dispute that it has filed paperwork with Pennsylvania seeking the right to do business there. It does not dispute that it has established an office in the Commonwealth to receive service of process on any claim. It does not dispute that it appreciated the jurisdictional consequences attending these actions and proceeded anyway, presumably because it thought the benefits outweighed the costs. But, in the name of the Due Process Clause, Norfolk Southern insists  we should dismiss all that as a raft of meaningless formalities.10",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,72,"Taken seriously, this argument would have us undo not just Pennsylvania Fire but a legion of precedents that attach jurisdictional consequences to what some might dismiss as mere formalities. Consider some examples we have already encountered. In a typical general jurisdiction case under International Shoe, a company is subject to suit on any claim in a forum State only because of its decision to file a piece of paper there (a certificate of incorporation). The firm is amenable to suit even if all of its operations are located elsewhere and even if its certificate only sits collecting dust on an office shelf for years thereafter. See, e.g., Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924, 131 S.Ct. 2846. Then there is the tag rule. The invisible state line might seem a trivial thing. But when an individual takes one step off a plane after flying from New Jersey to California, the jurisdictional consequences are immediate and serious. See Burnham, 495 U.S. at 619, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (plurality opinion).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,73,"Consider, too, just a few other examples. A defendant who appears specially to contest jurisdiction preserves his defense, but one who forgets can lose his. See York v. Texas, 137 U.S. 15, 19-21, 11 S.Ct. 9, 34 L.Ed. 604 (1890). Failing to comply with certain pre-trial court orders, signing a contract with a forum selection clause, accepting an in-state benefit with jurisdictional strings attached—all these actions as well can carry with them profound consequences for personal jurisdiction. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703-706, 102 S.Ct. 2099 (collecting cases), see also post, at 2045-2046 (opinion of JACKSON, J.).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-016,74,"The truth is, under our precedents a variety of actions of the defendant that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a court. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704-705, 102 S.Ct. 2099, see also Brief for Stephen E. Sachs as Amicus Curiae 10. That was so before International Shoe, and it remains so today. Should we overrule them all? Taking Norfolk Southern's argument seriously would require just that. But, tellingly, the company does not follow where its argument leads or even acknowledge its implications. Instead, Norfolk Southern asks us to pluck out and overrule just one long-standing precedent that it happens to dislike. We decline the invitation. Post, at 2048-2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.).

Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 37 S.Ct. 344, 61 L.Ed. 610 (1917). I also consider our ruling in Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982), to be particularly instructive.",Jackson,0,
2022-016,79,"In Insurance Corp. of Ireland, this Court confirmed a simple truth: The due process requirement of personal jurisdiction is an individual, waivable right. Id., at 703, 102 S.Ct. 2099. The requirement exists, we said, to ensure that the forum State has sufficient contacts with a defendant, such that `the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' Ibid. (quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)). We noted further that the interstate federalism concerns informing that right are ultimately a function of the individual liberty interest that this due process right preserves. 456 U.S. at 703, n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 2099. Because the personal-jurisdiction right belongs to the defendant, however, we explained that a defendant can choose to subject itself to powers from which it may otherwise be protected. Ibid. When that happens, a State can exercise jurisdiction over the defendant consistent with the Due Process Clause, even if our personal-jurisdiction cases would normally preclude the State from subjecting a defendant to its authority under the circumstances presented. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-016,80,"Waiver is thus a critical feature of the personal-jurisdiction analysis. And there is more than one way to waive personal-jurisdiction rights, as Insurance Corp. of Ireland also clarified. A defendant can waive its rights by explicitly or implicitly consenting to litigate future disputes in a particular State's courts. Id., at 703-704, 102 S.Ct. 2099. A defendant might also fail to follow specific procedural rules, and end up waiving the right to object to personal jurisdiction as a consequence. Id., at 705-706, 102 S.Ct. 2099. Or a defendant can voluntarily invoke certain benefits from a State that are conditioned on submitting to the State's jurisdiction. Id., at 704, 102 S.Ct. 2099 (citing Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59, 67-68, 58 S.Ct. 454, 82 L.Ed. 649 (1938)).",Jackson,0,
2022-016,81,"Regardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its personal-jurisdiction rights expressly or constructively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. of Ireland is  the same: When a defendant chooses to engage in behavior that amounts to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court, the Due Process Clause poses no barrier to the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction. 456 U.S. at 704-705, 102 S.Ct. 2099.",Jackson,0,
2022-016,82,"In my view, there is no question that Norfolk Southern waived its personal-jurisdiction rights here. As the Court ably explains, Norfolk Southern agreed to register as a foreign corporation in Pennsylvania in exchange for the ability to conduct business within the Commonwealth and receive associated benefits.

Moreover, when Norfolk Southern made that decision, the jurisdictional consequences of registration were clear. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5301(a)(2)(i) (1981) (expressly linking qualification as a foreign corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth to the exercise of general personal jurisdiction), ___ Pa. ___, 266 A.3d 542, 569 (2021) (acknowledging that foreign corporations are given reasonable notice of the jurisdictional implications of registration).",Jackson,0,
2022-016,83,"Nor was Norfolk Southern compelled to register and submit itself to the general jurisdiction of Pennsylvania courts simply because its trains passed through the Commonwealth. See, e.g., 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 403(a)(11) (2014), 1972 Pa. Laws pp. 1154-1155. Registration is required when corporations seek to conduct local business in a regular, systematic, or extensive way. 266 A.3d at 562-563 (internal quotation marks omitted). Norfolk Southern apparently deemed registration worthwhile and opted in.",Jackson,0,
2022-016,84,"Under Insurance Corp. of Ireland, the due process question that this case presents is easily answered. Having made the choice to register and do business in Pennsylvania despite the jurisdictional consequences (and having thereby voluntarily relinquished the due process rights our general-jurisdiction precedents afford), Norfolk Southern cannot be heard to complain that its due process rights are violated by having to defend itself in Pennsylvania's courts. Whether Pennsylvania could have asserted general jurisdiction over Norfolk Southern absent any waiver, see post, at 2056-2057 (BARRETT, J., dissenting), is beside the point.",Jackson,0,
2022-016,85,"In other areas of the law, we permit States to ask defendants to waive individual rights and safeguards. See, e.g., Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970) (allowing plea bargains to waive a defendant's trial rights and the right against self-incrimination), Barker v.

Moreover, when defendants do so, we respect that waiver decision and hold them to that choice, even though the government could not have otherwise bypassed the rules and procedures those rights protect. Insisting that our general-jurisdiction precedents preclude Pennsylvania from subjecting corporations to suit within its borders— despite their waiver of the protections those precedents entail—puts the personal-jurisdiction requirement on a pedestal. But there is nothing unique about the requirement of personal jurisdiction that prevents it from being  waived like other individual rights. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 706, 102 S.Ct. 2099.",Jackson,0,
2022-016,86,"In short, Insurance Corp. of Ireland makes clear that the personal-jurisdiction requirement is an individual, waivable right, and I agree with the Court that Norfolk Southern waived that right by choosing to register as a foreign corporation under the circumstances presented in this case.

2022-016,88,"The sole question before us is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a large out-of-state corporation with substantial operations in a State complies with a registration requirement that conditions the right to do business in that State on the registrant's submission to personal jurisdiction in any suits that are brought there. I agree with the Court that the answer to this question is no. Assuming that the Constitution allows a State to impose such a registration requirement, I see no reason to conclude that such suits violate the corporation's right to `fair play and substantial justice.'

2022-016,89,"I am not convinced, however, that the Constitution permits a State to impose such a submission-to-jurisdiction requirement. A State's assertion of jurisdiction over lawsuits with no real connection to the State may violate fundamental principles that are protected by one or more constitutional provisions or by the very structure of the federal system that the Constitution created. At this point in the development of our constitutional case law, the most appropriate home for these principles is the so-called dormant Commerce Clause. Norfolk Southern appears to have asserted a Commerce Clause claim below, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not address it. See ___ Pa. ___, 266 A.3d 542, 559-560, nn. 9, 11 (2021). Presumably, Norfolk Southern can renew the challenge on remand. I therefore agree that we should vacate the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.",Alito,0,

Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (acknowledging that the railroad understood by filing registration paperwork that it was subject to Pennsylvania's general jurisdiction law).

There, an Arizona mining company sued a Pennsylvania  insurance company in a Missouri court, alleging claims arising from events in Colorado. Id., at 94, 37 S.Ct. 344. The Pennsylvania insurance company had obtained a license to do business in Missouri, and so had complied with a Missouri statute requiring the company to execute a power of attorney consenting to service of process on the state insurance superintendent in exchange for licensure. Ibid. The Missouri Supreme Court had previously construed such powers of attorney as consent to jurisdiction in Missouri for all claims, including those arising from transactions outside the State. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co. v. Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 267 Mo. 524, 549-550, 184 S.W. 999, 1003-1005 (1916) (citing State ex rel. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

2022-016,94,"The parallels between Pennsylvania Fire and the case before us are undeniable. In both, a large company incorporated in one State was actively engaged in business in another State. In connection with that business, both companies took steps that, under the express terms or previous authoritative construction of state law, were understood as consent to the State's jurisdiction in suits on all claims, no matter where the events underlying the suit took place. In both cases, an out-of-state plaintiff sued the out-of-state company, alleging claims unrelated to the company's forum-state conduct. And in both, the out-of-state company objected, arguing that holding it to the terms of its consent would violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. In Pennsylvania Fire, we held that there was no due process violation in these circumstances. Given the near-complete overlap of material facts, that holding, unless it has been overruled, is binding here.",Alito,0,

Norfolk Southern cites the International Shoe line of cases, but those cases involve constitutional limits on jurisdiction over non-consenting corporations.

We have long recognized that the Constitution restricts a State's power to reach out and regulate conduct that has little if any connection with the State's legitimate interests. This principle, an obvious and necessary result of our constitutional order, is not confined to any one clause or section, but is expressed in the very nature of the federal system that the Constitution created and in numerous provisions that bear on States' interactions with one another.

By its terms, the Due Process Clause is about procedure, but over the years, it has become a refuge of sorts for constitutional principles that are not procedural but would otherwise be homeless as the result of having been exiled from the provisions in which they may have originally been intended to reside. This may be true, for example, with respect to the protection of substantive rights that might otherwise be guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges and Immunities Clause. See McDonald v.

The Court warned that, in certain circumstances, a State's exercise of jurisdiction over non-residents would be an encroachment upon the independence of another State and a usurpation of that State's authority. Id., at 723. And the Court noted that this was not a newly-developed doctrine, but reflected well-established principles of public law that had been frequently expressed in opinions of eminent judges, and  carried into adjudications in numerous cases.

Indeed, it is hard to see how such a decision could be justified. The Due Process Clause confers a right on persons, Amdt. 14, § 1, not States.

Once a state law is shown to discriminate against interstate commerce `either on its face or in practical effect,' the law's proponent must demonstrate both that the statute `serves a legitimate local purpose,' and that this purpose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986). Justification of a discriminatory law faces a high bar to overcome the presumption of invalidity. New Energy Co. of Ind. v.

Small companies may prudently choose not to enter an out-of-state market due to the increased risk of remote litigation.

2022-016,120,"Given these serious burdens, to survive Commerce Clause scrutiny under this Court's framework, the law must advance a `legitimate local public interest' and the burdens must not be `clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.' Wayfair, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2091. But I am hard-pressed to identify any legitimate local interest that is advanced by requiring an out-of-state company to defend a suit brought by an out-of-state plaintiff on claims wholly unconnected to the forum State. A State certainly has a legitimate interest in regulating activities conducted within its borders, which may include providing a forum to redress harms that occurred within the State. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 422, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003), BMW of North America, 517 U.S. at 568-569, 116 S.Ct. 1589, Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 356, 47 S.Ct. 632, 71 L.Ed. 1091 (1927). A State also may have an interest in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 473, 105 S.Ct. 2174. But a State generally does not have a legitimate local interest in vindicating the rights of non-residents harmed by out-of-state actors through conduct outside the State. See, e.g., Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 644, 102 S.Ct. 2629, 73 L.Ed.2d 269 (1982). With no legitimate local interest served, there is nothing to be weighed  to sustain the law. Ibid. And even if some legitimate local interest could be identified, I am skeptical that any local benefits of the State's assertion of jurisdiction in these circumstances could overcome the serious burdens on interstate commerce that it imposes.

2022-016,124,"For 75 years, we have held that the Due Process Clause does not allow state courts to assert general jurisdiction over foreign defendants merely because they do business in the State. International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 317, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). Pennsylvania nevertheless claims general jurisdiction over all corporations that lawfully do business within its borders. As the Commonwealth's own courts recognized, that flies in the face of our precedent. See Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 139-140, 134 S.Ct. 746, 187 L.Ed.2d 624 (2014).",Barrett,0,
2022-016,125,"The Court finds a way around this settled rule. All a State must do is compel a corporation to register to conduct business there (as every State does) and enact a law making registration sufficient for suit on any cause (as every State could do). Then, every company doing business in the State is subject to general jurisdiction based on implied consent—not contacts. That includes suits, like this one, with no connection whatsoever to the forum.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,126,"Such an approach does not formally overrule our traditional contacts-based approach to jurisdiction, but it might as well. By relabeling their long-arm statutes, States may now manufacture consent to personal jurisdiction. Because I would not permit state governments to circumvent constitutional limits so easily, I respectfully dissent.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,129,"Personal jurisdiction is the authority of a court to issue a judgment that binds a defendant. If a defendant submits to a court's authority, the court automatically acquires personal jurisdiction. Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982). But if a defendant contests the court's authority, the court must determine whether it can nevertheless assert coercive power over the defendant. That calculus turns first on the statute or rule defining the persons within the court's reach. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 290, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). It depends next on the Due Process Clause, which guards a defendant's right to resist the judicial authority of a sovereign to which it has an insufficient tie. International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154. The Clause has the companion role of ensuring that state courts do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system. World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 291-292, 100 S.Ct. 580.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,130,"Our precedent divides personal jurisdiction into two categories: specific and general. Both are subject to the demands of the Due Process Clause. Specific jurisdiction, as its name suggests, allows a state court to adjudicate specific claims against a defendant.

This sweeping authority exists only when the defendant's connection to the State is tight—so tight, in fact, that the defendant is `at home' there. Ford Motor, 592 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1024. An individual is typically at home in her domicile, Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924, 131 S.Ct. 2846, and a corporation is typically at home in both its place of incorporation and principal place of business, Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137, 134 S.Ct. 746.

Look no further than BNSF R. Co. v. Tyrrell, a case with remarkably similar facts—and one that the Court conspicuously ignores. 581 U.S. 402, 137 S.Ct. 1549, 198 L.Ed.2d 36 (2017). There, we assessed whether Montana's courts could exercise general jurisdiction over the BNSF railroad. No plaintiff resided in Montana or suffered an injury there. Like Mallory, one of the plaintiffs alleged that the railroad exposed him to toxic substances that caused his cancer. Id., at 406, 137 S.Ct. 1549. Like Norfolk Southern, BNSF had tracks and employees in the forum, but it was neither incorporated nor headquartered there. Id., at 406-407, 137 S.Ct. 1549.

Id., at 414, 137 S.Ct. 1549. Daimler and Goodyear, we explained, could not have made that any clearer. BNSF, 581 U.S. at 414, 137 S.Ct. 1549.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,136,"The same rule applies here. The Pennsylvania statute announces that registering to do business in the Commonwealth shall constitute a sufficient basis for general jurisdiction. § 5301(a).

If it did, every corporation would be subject to general jurisdiction in every state in which it registered, and Daimler's ruling would be  robbed of meaning by a back-door thief. Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 640 (CA2 2016).",Barrett,0,
2022-016,139,"The Court short-circuits this precedent by characterizing this case as one about consent rather than contacts-based jurisdiction. Consent is an established basis for personal jurisdiction, which is, after all, a waivable defense. A variety of legal arrangements have been taken to represent express or implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the court, including contract, stipulation, and in-court appearance. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703-704, 102 S.Ct. 2099. Today, the Court adds corporate registration to the list.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,140,"This argument begins on shaky ground, because Pennsylvania itself does not treat registration as synonymous with consent. Section 5301(a)(2)(i) baldly asserts that qualification as a foreign corporation in the Commonwealth is a sufficient hook for general jurisdiction. The next subsection (invoked by neither Mallory nor the Court) permits the exercise of general jurisdiction over a corporation based on consent, to the extent authorized by the consent. § 5301(a)(2)(ii). If registration were actual consent, one would expect to see some mention of jurisdiction in Norfolk Southern's registration paperwork—which is instead wholly silent on the matter. App. 1-7. What Mallory calls consent is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court called compelled submission to general jurisdiction by legislative command. 266 A.3d at 569. Corporate registration triggers a statutory repercussion, but that is not consent in a conventional sense of the word.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,141,"To pull § 5301(a)(2)(i) under the umbrella of consent, the Court, following Mallory, casts it as setting the terms of a bargain: In exchange for access to the Pennsylvania market, a corporation must allow the Commonwealth's courts to adjudicate any and all claims against it, even those (like Mallory's) having nothing to do with Pennsylvania. Brief for Petitioner 27-28. Everyone is charged with knowledge of the law, so corporations are on notice of the deal. By registering, they agree to its terms.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,142,"While this is a clever theory, it falls apart on inspection. The Court grounds consent in a corporation's choice to register with knowledge (constructive or actual) of the jurisdictional consequences. Ante, at 2036-2038, 2043-2044 (proceeding anyway in light of the jurisdictional consequences attending these actions), ante, at 2047 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (basing consent on presumed knowledge of state law), ante, at 2046 (JACKSON, J., concurring) (registering and doing business in Pennsylvania despite the jurisdictional consequences). But on that logic, any long-arm statute could be said to elicit consent. Imagine a law that simply provides, any corporation doing business in this State is subject to general jurisdiction in our courts. Such a law defies our precedent, which, again, holds that in-state business  does not suffice to permit the assertion of general jurisdiction. BNSF, 581 U.S. at 414, 137 S.Ct. 1549. Yet this hypothetical law, like the Pennsylvania statute, gives notice that general jurisdiction is the price of doing business. And its notice is no less clear than Pennsylvania's. Ante, at 2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.). So on the Court's reasoning, corporations that choose to do business in the State impliedly consent to general jurisdiction. The result: A State could defeat the Due Process Clause by adopting a law at odds with the Due Process Clause.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,143,"That makes no sense. If the hypothetical statute overreaches, then Pennsylvania's  does too. As the United States observes, invoking the label `consent' rather than `general jurisdiction' does not render Pennsylvania's long-arm statute constitutional.

2022-016,145,"While our due process precedent permits States to place reasonable conditions on foreign corporations in exchange for access to their markets, there is nothing reasonable about a State extracting consent in cases where it has no connection whatsoever. 266 A.3d at 566, Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. at 263, 137 S.Ct. 1773, see Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407, 15 L.Ed. 451 (1856). The Due Process Clause protects more than the rights of defendants—it also protects interstate federalism. We have emphasized this principle in case after case. For instance, in Hanson v. Denckla, we stressed that restrictions on personal jurisdiction are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States. 357 U.S. at 250-251, 78 S.Ct. 1228. In World-Wide Volkswagen, we explained that even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State  the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. 444 U.S. at 294, 100 S.Ct. 559. And in Bristol-Myers, we reinforced that this federalism interest may be decisive. 582 U.S. at 263, 137 S.Ct. 1773, see also, e.g., Ford Motor, 592 U.

Ibid., see also ante, at 2050-2051 (opinion of ALITO, J.), ante, at 2045-2046 (opinion of JACKSON, J.). That is not how we treat rights with structural components. The right to remove a case to federal court, for instance, is primarily personal—it secures for a nonresident defendant a federal forum thought to be more impartial. See The Federalist No. 80, p. 478 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). At the same time, however, it serves federal interests by ensuring that federal courts can vindicate federal rights.

Recognizing this dual role, we have rejected efforts of States to require defendants to relinquish this (waivable) right to removal as a condition of doing business. See Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 453, 456-458, 22 L.Ed. 365 (1874) (citing Lafayette, 18 How. at 407), Barron v.

The same logic applies here. Pennsylvania's power grab infringes on more than just the rights of defendants—it upsets the proper role of the States in our federal system.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,150,"The plurality attempts to minimize the novelty of its conclusion by pointing to our decision in Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604, 110 S.Ct. 2105, 109 L.Ed.2d 631 (1990). There, we considered whether tag jurisdiction— personal service upon a defendant physically present in the forum State—remains an effective basis for general jurisdiction after International Shoe.

The plurality claims that registration jurisdiction for a corporation is just as valid as the tag jurisdiction that we approved in Burnham. But in drawing this analogy, the plurality omits any discussion of Burnham's reasoning.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,151,"In Burnham, we acknowledged that tag jurisdiction would not satisfy the contacts-based test for general jurisdiction. Nonetheless, we reasoned that tag jurisdiction is both firmly approved by tradition and still favored, making it one of the continuing traditions of our legal system that defines the due process standard of `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' Id., at 619, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (opinion of Scalia, J.)

2022-016,153,"Start with the second prong. In Burnham, we did not know of a single state that had abandoned in-state service as a basis of jurisdiction. Id., at 615, 110 S.Ct. 2105. Here, as Mallory concedes, Pennsylvania is the only State with a statute treating registration as sufficient for general jurisdiction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. Indeed, quite a few have jettisoned the jurisdictional consequences of corporate registration altogether—and in no uncertain terms. See, e.g., Chavez v. Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, LLC, 2022-NMSC-006, ¶¶1, 53-54, 503 P.3d 332, 336, 349 (Reliance upon outdated legal fictions would be absurd and, as explained above, inconsistent with contemporary understandings of due process), Genuine Parts Co. v.

Co., 392 Mont. 446, 453, n. 1, 426 P.3d 1, 7, n. 1 (2018) (listing States with statutes that do not permit the practice).2 With the Pennsylvania Legislature standing alone, the plurality does not even attempt to describe this method of securing general jurisdiction as still favored, Burnham, 495 U.S. at 622, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (opinion of Scalia, J.), or reflective of our common understanding now, id., at 635-637, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted). Quite the opposite: The plurality denigrates the spirit of our age—reflected by the vast majority of States—and appeals to its own notions of fairness. Ante, at 2040-2043.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,154,"The past is as fatal to the plurality's theory as the present. Burnham's tradition prong asks whether a method for securing jurisdiction was shared by American courts at the crucial time— 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. 495 U.S. at 611, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (opinion of Scalia, J.). But the plurality cannot identify a single case from that period supporting its theory.3 In fact, the evidence runs in the opposite direction. Statutes that required the appointment of a registered agent for service of process were far more modest than Pennsylvania's.4 And even when a statute was written  more broadly, state courts generally understood it to implicitly limit jurisdiction to suits with a connection to the forum. The state reporters are replete with examples of judicial decisions that stood by the then-prevailing rule: Compliance with a registration law did not subject a foreign corporation to suit on any cause in a State, but only those related to the forum. Smith v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N. Y., 96 Mass. 336, 340-343 (1867), see also, e.g., Camden Rolling Mill v. Swede Iron Co., 32 N.J.L. 15, 18 (1866) (rejecting a statutory construction that would place within the jurisdiction of our courts, all the corporations of the world), Newell v. Great W. R. Co. of Canada, 19 Mich. 336, 345-346 (1869) (legislature could never have intended to make our tribunals, maintained by the people of Michigan, the arbiters of differences in which our citizens have no interest), Sawyer v. North Am. Life Ins. Co., 46 Vt. 697, 707 (1874) (broadly worded statute did not reach a corporate party not a resident, on a cause of action which did not accrue here), Central R. & Banking Co. v. Carr, 76 Ala. 388, 393 (1884) (collecting cases).5 Our cases from this era articulate the same line. See, e.g., Lafayette, 18 How. at 407 (statutory consent to suit may reach contracts made and to be performed within that State), St. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356-357, 1 S.Ct. 354 (statutory consent permitted for suits arising out of a foreign corporation's transactions in the State), Old Wayne Mut. Life Assn. of Indianapolis v. McDonough, 204 U.S. 8, 21, 27 S.Ct. 236, 51 L.Ed. 345 (1907) (It cannot be held that the company agreed that service of process would alone be sufficient to bring it into court in respect of all business transacted by it, no matter where), Simon v. Southern R. Co., 236 U.S. 115, 130, 35 S.Ct. 255, 59 L.Ed. 492 (1915) (statutory consent of a foreign corporation to be sued does not extend to causes of action arising in other states). Although plaintiffs typically did not sue defendants in fora that had no rational relation to causes of action, Genuine Parts, 137 A.3d at 146, courts repeatedly turned them away when they did.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,156,"Sidestepping Burnham's logic, the plurality seizes on its bottom-line approval of tag jurisdiction. According to the plurality, tag jurisdiction (based on physical presence) and registration jurisdiction (based on deemed consent) are essentially the same thing—so by blessing one, Burnham blessed the other. See ante, at 2032-2033, 2040. The plurality never explains why they are the same, even though—as we have just discussed—more than a century's worth of law treats them as distinct. See also Burnham, 495 U.S. at 610, n. 1, 110 S.Ct. 2105 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (corporations have never fit comfortably in a jurisdictional regime based primarily upon `de facto power over the defendant's person'), International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316-317, 66 S.Ct. 154. The plurality's rationale seems to be that if a person is subject  to general jurisdiction anywhere she is present, then a corporation should be subject to general jurisdiction anywhere it does business. See ante, at 2032-2033, 2034-2035, 2036-2037, 2040, 2044. That is not only a non sequitur—it is contrary to the historical rationale of International Shoe. Wenche Siemer v. Learjet Acquisition Corp., 966 F.2d 179, 183 (CA5 1992).",Barrett,0,
2022-016,157,"Before International Shoe, a state court's power over a person turned strictly on service of process within the State (presence) or her voluntary appearance (consent). Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 733, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1878). In response to changes in interstate business and transportation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, States deployed new legal fictions designed to secure the presence or consent of nonresident individuals and foreign corporations. For example, state laws required nonresident drivers to give their implied consent to be sued for their in-state accidents as a condition of using the road. Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 356, 47 S.Ct. 632, 71 L.Ed. 1091 (1927), World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 296, n. 11, 100 S.Ct. 580. And foreign corporations, as we have discussed, were required by statute to consent to the appointment of a resident agent, so that the company could then be constructively present for in-state service. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn. v. Phelps, 190 U.S. 147, 158-159, 23 S.Ct. 707, 47 L.Ed. 987 (1903), see St. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356, 1 S.Ct. 354.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,158,"As Justice Scalia explained, such extensions of consent and presence were purely fictional and can no longer stand after International Shoe. Burnham, 495 U.S. at 618, 110 S.Ct. 2105, see also, e.g., Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 202-203, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977) (International Shoe abandoned both the fictions of implied consent to service on the part of a foreign corporation and of corporate presence), McGee v. International Life Ins.

The very point of International Shoe was to cast  aside the legal fictions built on the old territorial approach to personal jurisdiction and replace them with its contacts-based test.

In Burnham, we upheld tag jurisdiction because it is not one of those fictions—it is presence. By contrast, Pennsylvania's registration statute is based on deemed consent. And this kind of legally implied consent is one of the very fictions that our decision in International Shoe swept away. See 326 U.S. at 318, 66 S.Ct. 154, Ford Motor, 592 U.

Id., at 94-95, 37 S.Ct. 344. But in compliance with Missouri law, the defendant company had previously filed a power of attorney consenting that service of process upon the superintendent of the State's insurance department should be deemed personal service upon the company. Id., at 94, 37 S.Ct. 344. The Missouri Supreme Court construed that power of attorney as express consent to personal jurisdiction in Missouri in any case whatsoever, and this Court held that the construction did not deprive the defendant of due process of law.

If mere formalities matter as much as the plurality says they do, it should respect this one too. Ante, at 2044.",Barrett,0,
2022-016,168,"By now, it should be clear that the plurality's primary approach to this case is to look past our personal jurisdiction precedent. Relying on a factsheet downloaded from the internet, for instance, the plurality argues that Norfolk Southern is such a part of `the Pennsylvania Community,' and does so much business there, that its presence in Pennsylvania is enough to require it to stand for suits having nothing to do with the Commonwealth. Ante, at 2040-2043, see also ante, at 2048-2049 (opinion of ALITO, J.).9 In Daimler, however, we roundly rejected the plaintiff's request that we approve the exercise of general jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation `engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.' 571 U.S. at 138, 134 S.Ct. 746. The established test—which the plurality barely acknowledges—is whether the corporation is at home in the State.

Provisions of the FNHRA refer to rights of nursing-home residents to be free from unnecessary physical or chemical restraints and to be discharged or transferred only when certain preconditions are satisfied. This case is about these particular provisions and whether nursing-home residents can seek to vindicate those FNHRA rights in court.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,30,"Respondent Ivanka Talevski maintains that she can enforce the rights these particular FNHRA provisions describe via 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which, since the 1870s, has provided an express cause of action to any person deprived (by someone acting under color of state law) of any rights  secured by the Constitution and laws. Petitioners insist that respondent is wrong about being able to rely on § 1983 in this context, for two independent reasons. First, petitioners urge us to discard our longstanding recognition that § 1983's unqualified reference to laws means what it says, Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980), and to rule instead that § 1983 contains an implicit carveout for laws that Congress enacts via its spending power—a holding that, according to petitioners, would mean that § 1983 could not be used to enforce any rights the FNHRA purports to recognize. In the alternative, petitioners point to our established methods for determining whether a statutory provision creates a § 1983-enforceable right and maintain that these FNHRA provisions do not create rights that nursing-home residents can enforce via § 1983.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,31,"We reject both propositions. Laws means laws, no less today than in the 1870s, and nothing in petitioners' appeal to Reconstruction-era contract law shows otherwise. Consequently, as we have previously held, § 1983 can presumptively be used to enforce unambiguously conferred federal individual rights, unless a private right of action under § 1983 would thwart any enforcement mechanism that the rights-creating statute contains for protection of the rights it has created. Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 253-255, 129 S.Ct. 788, 172 L.Ed.2d 582 (2009), Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, and n. 4, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002).

2022-017,55,"We have adhered to this understanding of § 1983's operation.

2022-017,57,"We are not persuaded by HHC's argument (which Justice THOMAS supports, see post, at 1464-1465, 1483-1484 (dissenting opinion)), that Talevski cannot invoke § 1983 to vindicate the rights the FNHRA provisions at issue here purport to recognize because Congress seems to have enacted the FNHRA pursuant to the spending power recognized in Article I, § 8, of the Constitution.5",Jackson,0,
2022-017,58,"HHC's argument generally proceeds as follows. Starting with our precedent regarding Congress's spending power, HHC begins by emphasizing our observation that federal legislation premised on that power is much in the nature of a contract, because, in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with  federally imposed conditions. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981), see also Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1562, 1570, 212 L.Ed.2d 552 (2022). HHC then seizes on the contract analogy to create a syllogism. It reasons that (1) any private party suing to enforce an obligation between Federal and State Governments that a Spending Clause statute creates is, essentially, a third-party beneficiary (by which HHC means beneficiaries of rights created in any such statute), and (2) under common-law contract principles extant at the time that Congress enacted § 1983, third-party beneficiaries were generally barred from suing to enforce contract obligations, therefore, (3) plaintiffs like Talevski, as a purported third-party beneficiary of the FNHRA, may not use § 1983 to do something that third-party beneficiaries of contracts generally could not do in the 1870s. Brief for Petitioners 13, 17-18 (citing 1870s treatises and state cases).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,59,"The upshot, for HHC, is that Spending Clause statutes do not give rise to privately enforceable rights under Section 1983 because contracts were not generally enforceable by third-party beneficiaries at common law. Id., at 11, 13. On this basis alone, HHC thus, in effect, urges us to reject decades of precedent, and to rewrite § 1983's plain text to read laws (unless those laws rest on the Spending Power).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,60,"Two well-established principles, applied here, suffice to reject HHC's invitation to reimagine Congress's handiwork (and our precedent interpreting it).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,61,"First, our prior § 1983 cases reference `firmly rooted' common-law principles. Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 164, 112 S.Ct. 1827, 118 L.Ed.2d 504 (1992). We implement Congress's choices rather than remake them. Azar v. Allina Health Services, 587 U. S. ___, ___-___, 139 S.Ct. 1804, 1815-16, 204 L.Ed.2d 139 (2019). Thus, we have reasoned that Congress's failure to displace firmly rooted common-law principles generally indicates that it incorporated those established principles into § 1983. Wyatt, 504 U.S., at 163-164, 112 S.Ct. 1827.6 Here, HHC's key common-law plank—that third-party beneficiaries could not sue to enforce contractual obligations during the relevant time—is, at a minimum, contestable. See Brief for Contract Law Professors et al. as Amici Curiae 4 (A majority of American jurisdictions permitted third-party beneficiaries to sue through at least the early 1870s), see also Hendrick v. Lindsay, 93 U.S. 143, 149, 23 L.Ed. 855 (1876) (concluding that the right of a party to maintain assumpsit on a promise not under  seal, made to another for his benefit,  is now the prevailing rule in this country).7 Something more than `ambiguous historical evidence' is required before we will `flatly overrule a number of major decisions of this Court,' Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1960, 1969, 204 L.Ed.2d 322 (2019), as HHC essentially asks us to do here.",Jackson,0,

If there is a reason that the principles governing those suits should be read to displace the plain scope of § 1983's `species of tort liability,' Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 483, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), HHC has utterly failed to identify it.",Jackson,0,

Hewing to § 1983's text and history (not to mention our precedent and constitutional role), we reject HHC's request, and reaffirm that laws in § 1983 means what it says.

2022-017,65,"The FNHRA can create § 1983-enforceable rights. But do the two FNHRA provisions at issue in this case actually do so? In that respect, our precedent sets a demanding bar: Statutory provisions must unambiguously confer individual federal rights. Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 280, 122 S.Ct. 2268. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the bar has been cleared with respect to the presently contested provisions. And while the FNHRA itself might nevertheless evince Congress's intent to preclude the use of § 1983 to enforce these particular rights, id., at 284, n. 4, 122 S.Ct. 2268, we hold further that it does not.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,67,"The FNHRA provisions at issue in this case, like the rest of the Act, stem from a longstanding national commitment to provide safe and dignified care for the elderly. Since as early as the Social Security Act of 1935, federal law has aimed in myriad ways to promote nursing homes that provide quality services. Yet, concerns about the poor condition of such facilities persisted even after Congress enacted the 1965 Medicare and Medicaid Acts,9 partly due  to widespread noncompliance with existing federal and state laws. See Institute of Medicine, Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes 2-3, 11, 241-246 (1986), H. R. Rep. No. 100-391, pt. 1, pp. 448-452 (1987). Thus, in 1987, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed, the FNHRA, effecting a seismic shift in nursing-home quality standards. B. Furrow, T. Greaney, S. Johnson, T. Jost, & R. Schwartz, Health Law 51 (3d ed. 2015) (Health Law).10 The FNHRA is largely composed of a litany of statutory requirements that Congress laid out for Medicaid-participant States and nursing facilities. § 1396a(a)(28).11 Those include requirements relating to residents' rights, § 1396r(c) (boldface deleted), two of which Talevski's complaint invoked.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,68,"The first requires nursing facilities to protect and promote residents' right to be free from  any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. § 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (referred to herein as the unnecessary-restraint provision). The second appears in a subparagraph concerning transfer and discharge rights, § 1396r(c)(2)(A) (boldface deleted), and tells nursing facilities that they must not transfer or discharge a resident unless certain enumerated preconditions, including advance notice of such a transfer or discharge, are met. E.g., §§ 1396r(c)(2)(A)-(B) (referred to herein as the predischarge-notice provision).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,69,"As for enforcement, like other aspects of Medicaid, the FNHRA anticipates cooperative federalism—i.e., federal and state actors working together—to carry out the statute's aims. Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U.S. 473, 495, 122 S.Ct. 962, 151 L.Ed.2d 935 (2002). Thus, qualifying State Medicaid plans, which are approved by the Secretary of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS Secretary), § 1396a(b), must include provisions that relate to nursing facilities, and must require any nursing facility receiving payments under the plan to satisfy certain FNHRA mandates. § 1396a(a)(28). The HHS Secretary must also assure that approved state plans—and the enforcement of plan requirements—are, inter alia, adequate to protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of nursinghome residents. § 1396r(f)(1).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,70,"The FNHRA also establishes a detailed administrative scheme for government inspections of nursing facilities. § 1396r(g). Surveys (in the statute's parlance) must be conducted to detect nursing homes that are falling short of the FNHRA's minimum standards, and state and federal officials must periodically file certifications, based on these surveys, regarding nursing-home compliance, see § 1396r(g)(1)(A). In addition, the statute authorizes government actors to sanction and correct non-compliant facilities, or, if appropriate, exclude them from the Medicaid program  entirely. § 1396r(h), see also Health Law 56-63.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,73,"Although federal statutes have the potential to create § 1983-enforceable rights, they do not do so as a matter of course. For Spending Clause legislation in particular, we have recognized that `the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate funds to the State.' Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 280, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S., at 28, 101 S.Ct. 1531). The parties here thus dispute whether this is the atypical case, that is, whether the unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions of the FNHRA unambiguously confer individual rights, making those rights presumptively enforceable under § 1983. 536 U.S. at 283-284, 122 S.Ct. 2268.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,74,"Gonzaga sets forth our established method for ascertaining unambiguous conferral. Courts must employ traditional tools of statutory construction to assess whether Congress has unambiguously conferred individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries to which the plaintiff belongs. Id., at 283, 285-286, 122 S.Ct. 2268, see also Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120, 125 S.Ct. 1453, 161 L.Ed.2d 316 (2005). Notably, it must be determined that Congress intended to create a federal right for the identified class, not merely that the plaintiffs fall within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect. Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 283, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (emphasis deleted). This paradigm respects Congress's primacy in this arena and thus vindicates the separation of powers. Id., at 286, 122 S.Ct. 2268.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,75,"We have held that the Gonzaga test is satisfied where the provision in question is `phrased in terms of the persons benefited' and contains rights-creating, individual-centric language with an `unmistakable focus on the benefited class.' Id., at 284, 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (emphasis deleted). Conversely, we have rejected § 1983 enforceability where the statutory provision contained no rights-creating language, had an aggregate, not individual, focus, and served primarily to direct the Federal Government's distribution of public funds. Id., at 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,76,"If a statutory provision surmounts this significant hurdle, it secures § 1983-enforceable rights, consistent with § 1983's text. And because § 1983 generally supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes, rights so secured are deemed presumptively enforceable under § 1983. Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,78,"The unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions meet this test. To start, we note that both reside in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(c), which expressly concerns requirements relating to residents' rights. Ibid. (emphasis added, boldface deleted), see also West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2587, 2607, 213 L.Ed.2d 896 (2022) (statutory provisions `must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme'). This framing is indicative of an individual rights-creating focus. Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Examined further, the text of the unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously confers rights upon the residents of nursing-home facilities.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,79,"The unnecessary-restraint provision requires nursing homes to protect and promote the right to be free from  any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. § 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). The provision's enumerated exceptions further sustain the focus on individual residents. For example, nursing homes may use restraints to ensure the physical safety of the resident or other residents, but only upon the written order of a physician that specifies the duration and circumstances under which the restraints are to be used (absent emergency circumstances specified by the HHS Secretary). §§ 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii)(I)-(II) (emphasis added).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,80,"The predischarge-notice provision is more of the same. Nestled in a paragraph concerning transfer and discharge rights, § 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added, boldface deleted), that provision tells nursing facilities that they must not transfer or discharge a resident unless certain preconditions are met, including advance notice of the transfer or discharge to the resident and his or her family. §§ 1396r(c)(2)(A)-(B) (emphasis added). And, again, the statute's caveats remain focused on individual residents: A nursing home may transfer or discharge such an individual if, among other things, the transfer is necessary to meet the resident's welfare, or if the resident's health has improved so much that the facility is no longer necessary, or if the safety or health of other individuals would be endangered. § 1396r(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The exceptions to the advance-notice requirement, too, turn (inter alia) on the resident's health, the resident's urgent medical needs, or the existence of threats to the safety or health of other individuals in the nursing home. §§ 1396r(c)(2)(B)(ii)(I)-(III) (emphasis added).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,81,"To be sure, these two provisions also establish who it is that must respect and honor these statutory rights, namely, the Medicaid-participant nursing homes in which these residents reside. See, e.g., §§ 1396a(a)(28), 1396r(c)(1)(A), 1396r(c)(2)(A), see also §§ 1396r(c)(1)(B)(i)-(ii) (requiring nursing homes to inform nursing-home residents of their rights, orally and in writing, upon admission and upon request). But that is not a material diversion from the necessary focus on the nursing-home residents, contrary to HHC's representations. Indeed, it would be strange to hold that a statutory provision fails to secure rights simply because it considers, alongside the rights bearers, the actors that might threaten those rights (and we have never so held).12",Jackson,0,
2022-017,82,"The unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions thus stand in stark contrast to the statutory provisions that failed Gonzaga's test in Gonzaga itself. Those provisions lacked rights-creating language, primarily directed the Federal Government's distribution of public funds, and had an aggregate, not individual, focus. 536 U.S. at 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268. The opposite is true here. The unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions use clear rights-creating language, speak `in terms of the persons benefited,' and have an `unmistakable focus on the benefited class.' Id., at 284, 287, 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (emphasis deleted). Thus, they satisfy Gonzaga's stringent standard, and the rights they recognize  are presumptively enforceable under § 1983.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,84,"Even if a statutory provision unambiguously secures rights, a defendant may defeat the presumption by demonstrating that Congress did not intend that § 1983 be available to enforce those rights. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120, 125 S.Ct. 1453.13 For evidence of such intent, we have looked to the statute creating the right. Ibid. A statute could, of course, expressly forbid § 1983's use. Fitzgerald, 555 U.S., at 252, 129 S.Ct. 788, Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120, 125 S.Ct. 1453. Absent such a sign, a defendant must show that Congress issued the same command implicitly, by creating a `comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under § 1983.' Id., at 120, 125 S.Ct. 1453. Only the latter path is at issue here.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,86,"Our precedent outlines what HHC must show to traverse the implicit-preclusion path. `The crucial consideration' is whether Congress intended a statute's remedial scheme to `be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert his claims.'

Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1009, 1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984) (emphasis added)), Fitzgerald, 555 U.S., at 252, 129 S.Ct. 788 (framing `the critical question' as `whether Congress meant the statute's remedial scheme to coexist with  a § 1983 action' (quoting Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120-121, 125 S.Ct. 1453)).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,87,"Our precedents make clear that the sine qua non of a finding that Congress implicitly intended to preclude a private right of action under § 1983 is incompatibility between enforcement under § 1983 and the enforcement scheme that Congress has enacted. 555 U.S. at 252-254, 129 S.Ct. 788. We have used many terms and concepts to describe the necessary discordance between § 1983 and a rights-conferring statute's remedial scheme: `incompatible,' `inconsistent,' and thwart are examples. Id., at 252-255, 129 S.Ct. 788. In all events, the question is whether the design of the enforcement scheme in the rights-conferring statute is inconsistent with enforcement under § 1983, such that a court must infer that Congress did not intend to make available the § 1983 remedy for these newly created rights. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120, 125 S.Ct. 1453, see also Fitzgerald, 555 U.S., at 252, 129 S.Ct. 788.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,88,"Put another way, the inquiry boils down to what Congress intended, as divined from text and context. The application of the traditional tools of statutory construction to a statute's remedial scheme may reveal no incompatibility between the enforcement  scheme that Congress crafted in the rights-conferring statute and enforcement under § 1983, or it may uncover sufficient incompatibility to make manifest Congress's intent to preclude § 1983 actions. See, e.g., id., at 253, 129 S.Ct. 788 (explaining a past implicit-preclusion case on the ground that permitting § 1983 claims there would have thwarted Congress' intent), Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 127, 125 S.Ct. 1453 (§ 1983's operation would have distorted the pertinent other statute's remedial scheme).",Jackson,0,
2022-017,90,We discern no incompatibility between the FNHRA's remedial scheme and § 1983 enforcement of the rights that the unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously secure.,Jackson,0,
2022-017,91,"As explained in Part III-A, supra, the FNHRA details administrative processes concerning inspection of covered nursing facilities and accountability for noncompliant facilities. But the statute lacks any indicia of congressional intent to preclude § 1983 enforcement, such as an express private judicial right of action or any other provision that might signify that intent. See, e.g., id., at 121, 125 S.Ct. 1453 (The existence of a more restrictive private remedy in the statute itself for statutory violations has been the dividing line between those cases in which we have held that an action would lie under § 1983 and those in which we have held that it would not). Nor has HHC otherwise demonstrated that enforcement via § 1983 would thwart the operation of the administrative remedial scheme in any respect.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,92,"HHC's argument that we need look no further than the detail of the FNHRA's enforcement mechanisms to find conclusive evidence of implicit preclusion is unpersuasive. Implicit preclusion is shown by a `comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under § 1983.' Fitzgerald, 555 U.S., at 252, 129 S.Ct. 788 (emphasis added). HHC's single-minded focus on comprehensiveness mistakes the shadow for the substance, and it disregards the import of these FNHRA provisions' unambiguous conferral of rights. The attendant presumption is that § 1983 can play its textually prescribed role as a vehicle for enforcing those rights, even alongside a detailed enforcement regime that also protects those interests, so long as § 1983 enforcement is not `incompatible' with Congress's handiwork. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120, 122, 125 S.Ct. 1453, Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 347-348, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997) (collecting cases).",Jackson,0,

National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 20, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981) (statutory remedial devices that are sufficiently comprehensive may suffice to show implicit preclusion). But when a particular comprehensive remedial scheme discharges the defendant's burden, it does so because the application of ordinary interpretive tools reveals incompatibility, i.e., it demonstrates that Congress intended that statute's remedial scheme to be the `exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert his claims.' Fitzgerald, 555 U.S., at 252, 129 S.Ct. 788.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,94,"Nothing in the FNHRA indicates the incompatibility evinced in our three prior cases finding implicit preclusion.

Rancho Palos Verdes, Smith, and Sea Clammers  concerned statutes with self-contained enforcement schemes that included statute-specific rights of action. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120-123, 125 S.Ct. 1453, Smith, 468 U.S., at 1008-1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457, Sea Clammers, 453 U.S., at 6-7, 17, and n. 27, 19-21, 101 S.Ct. 2615.

2022-017,95,"HHC has identified no equivalent sign in the FNHRA, nor has Justice ALITO, see post, at 1484, 1485-1486 (dissenting opinion).

HHC seems to think it enough to show that Congress was not slipshod in crafting the remedial scheme. But in a world where the FNHRA's remedial scheme could complement, not supplant, § 1983, id., at 122, 125 S.Ct. 1453, HHC must demonstrate more than that.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,96,"One last rebuttal argument warrants addressing. The United States says that, because private entities owned most nursing homes when the FNHRA was enacted in 1987 (as they do now), the FNHRA is a rare bird for implicit-preclusion purposes. In the United States' view, because Congress knew that most nursing homes could not be subject to suit under § 1983 anyway, see, e.g., Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 317-319, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981), the FNHRA's remedial scheme necessarily reflects Congress's judgment that these administrative enforcement mechanisms appropriately protect the rights the statute confers, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,97,"This argument is unavailing. The implicit-preclusion inquiry looks to the statute creating the right and any `comprehensive enforcement scheme' Congress has created in the statute `that is incompatible with individual enforcement under § 1983.' Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120, 125 S.Ct. 1453 (emphasis added). It does not invite speculation about ostensible marketplace realities that appear nowhere in the statute's text or relevant context. The relevant FNHRA provisions speak in neutral terms that do not distinguish between private and public nursing homes. And, regardless, the question remains whether something in the FNHRA has foreclosed § 1983's general availability as a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes. Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268. We see no such sign, much less a license for us to construct and impute congressional intent that the FNHRA does not embody.",Jackson,0,
2022-017,98,"The difficulty for HHC and the United States is that implicit preclusion, in this  context, requires something in the statute that shows that permitting § 1983 to operate would thwart Congress' intent in crafting the FNHRA. Fitzgerald, 555 U.S., at 253, 129 S.Ct. 788. We see nothing in the FNHRA that even hints at Congress's intent in this regard, if anything, the language of the Act confirms otherwise, for it plainly states that the remedies provided under its enforcement-process subsection are in addition to those otherwise available under State or Federal law and shall not be construed as limiting such other remedies. § 1396r(h)(8) (emphasis added).14 We will not rewrite § 1396r(h)(8) in lieu of rewriting § 1983.15* * *",Jackson,0,

That is an accurate statement of the key issue in this case. Section 1983 itself provides the answer. By its terms, § 1983 is available to enforce every right that Congress validly and unambiguously creates, we will not impose a categorical font-of-power condition that the Reconstruction Congress did not. And, here, the test that our precedents establish leads inexorably to the conclusion that the FNHRA secures the particular rights that Talevski invokes, without otherwise signaling that enforcement of those rights via § 1983 is precluded as incompatible with the FNHRA's remedial scheme.",Jackson,0,

Under Gonzaga, courts must ask whether text and structure indicate that the statute unambiguously confers federal rights. 536 U.S. at 283, 286, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Relevant considerations include whether the statute is `phrased in terms of the persons benefited,' whether it uses explicit rights-creating terms, and whether it has an individual, rather than an aggregate, focus. Id., at 284, 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268.",Barrett,0,
2022-017,108,"This bar is high, and although the FNHRA clears it, many federal statutes will not. As the Court explains, § 1983 actions are the exception—not the rule— for violations of Spending Clause statutes. Ante, at 1457. This is because the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate funds to the State. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). Indeed, since Pennhurst, we have interpreted only two Spending Clause statutes to be enforceable through § 1983. See Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 432, 107 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987), Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U.S. 498, 522-523, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990).",Barrett,0,
2022-017,109,"The third point is that even when a statute unambiguously confers rights, Congress can supplant any remedy that otherwise would be available under § 1983. Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 21, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981). At this step of the analysis, courts should apply ordinary interpretive tools to determine whether the statute allows access to § 1983. Ante, at 1459 1460, see Sea Clammers, 453 U.S., at 13, 20-21, 101 S.Ct. 2615 (We look first, of course, to the statutory language, particularly to the provisions made therein for enforcement and relief ). In some cases,  the text may expressly forbid § 1983 actions. In others, context may point to the same result. It is especially telling, for example, if the statute `creates a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under § 1983.' Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 284-285, n. 4, 122 S.Ct. 2268.",Barrett,0,
2022-017,110,"As the Court notes, the presence of an express private judicial right of action typically demonstrates that a § 1983 suit is not also available. Ante, at 1460, see Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 121, 125 S.Ct. 1453, 161 L.Ed.2d 316 (2005) (express cause of action is ordinarily an indication that Congress did not intend to leave open a more expansive remedy under § 1983). When the statutory cause of action restricts available remedies or imposes procedural hurdles to obtaining relief, the inference is even stronger. See Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 254, 129 S.Ct. 788, 172 L.Ed.2d 582 (2009) (considering whether a § 1983 suit would have circumvented these procedures and given plaintiffs access to tangible benefits—such as damages, attorney's fees, and costs—that were unavailable under the statute), Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 122-123, 125 S.Ct. 1453 (similar).",Barrett,0,
2022-017,111,"But an actual clash—one private judicial remedy against another, more expansive remedy—is not required to find that a statute forecloses recourse to § 1983. Our cases have looked to a wide range of contextual clues, like enforcement provisions that confer authority to sue  on government officials, Sea Clammers, 453 U.S., at 13, 20, 101 S.Ct. 2615, and any administrative remedies that the statute offers, Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). We have noted the relevance of a centralized review mechanism that would be undermined by piecemeal litigation. Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 289-290, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (statute directed the Secretary of Education to establish a review board to investigate and adjudicate alleged violations). And we have regularly taken account of the overall comprehensiveness of the statute's enforcement scheme. The more comprehensive the scheme, the less likely that it leaves the door open for § 1983 suits. Sea Clammers, 453 U.S., at 20, 101 S.Ct. 2615 (When the remedial devices provided in a particular Act are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under § 1983), Smith, 468 U.S., at 1011-1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457 (§ 1983 suits unavailable in light of the comprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees set out in the statute). None of these features is necessarily determinative, but each is part of the larger picture that courts must assess.",Barrett,0,
2022-017,112,"Courts must tread carefully before concluding that Spending Clause statutes may be enforced through § 1983. In this case, however, the Seventh Circuit correctly allowed Talevski's § 1983 suit to proceed. I therefore join the Court's opinion in full.",Barrett,0,
2022-017,113,"Justice THOMAS, dissenting.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,114,"I agree with Justice ALITO that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA) cannot be enforced through Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, under Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002). I write separately to highlight another and more fundamental reason why FNHRA cannot be enforced under § 1983. Section 1983 provides a cause of action to redress only the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws. But legislation enacted pursuant to Congress' spending power, like FNHRA, does not secure rights by law.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,115,"For nearly all of our Nation's history, it was understood that there is a fundamental difference between the exercise of Congress' sovereign legislative powers, on the one hand, and the exercise of its power to spend money and to attach conditions to the receipt of that money, on the other. Only the former sort of legislation, which imposes obligations on regulated parties with the force of law, directly secures by law the rights corresponding to those obligations. By contrast, an exercise of Congress' spending power, whether it comes from the so-called Spending Clause or elsewhere in the Constitution, is no more than a disposition of funds. As such, a conditional exercise of the spending power is nothing more than a contractual offer, any rights that may flow from that offer are secured only by the offeree's acceptance and implementation, not federal law itself.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,116,"Since Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980), however, this Court has ignored that fundamental distinction, permitting third parties who benefit from spending conditions to enforce them in § 1983 suits against state actors. In doing so, it has created a constitutional quandary: If spending conditions that benefit third parties are laws and secure rights in the same manner as ordinary lawmaking under Congress' sovereign legislative powers, then such conditions would contradict the bedrock constitutional prohibition against federal commandeering of the States. We escape this quandary only by recognizing spending conditions, not as rights-securing laws, but as the terms of possible contracts that secure rights only by virtue of an offeree's acceptance—the very conclusion compelled by the traditional understanding of the spending power. The choice between these alternatives is stark and unavoidable: Either spending conditions in statutes like FNHRA are not laws that secure rights cognizable under § 1983, or they are unconstitutional direct regulations of States. The Court must, at some point, revisit its understanding of the spending power and its relation to § 1983.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,118,"This case arises from a § 1983 suit to enforce FNHRA's spending conditions against a county-owned nursing home that receives federal funding. Enacted under Congress' spending power, FNHRA conditions the receipt of federal Medicaid funding by States and nursing facilities on compliance with a broad range of requirements.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,119,"These conditions largely consist of requirements that funding recipients protect certain rights of nursing-home residents. In a subsection entitled requirements relating to residents' rights, the Act requires recipients to protect and promote the rights of each resident, including the right to choose a personal attending physician and make informed medical decisions, the right to be free from physical or mental abuse, corporal punishment, involuntary seclusion, and any medically unnecessary physical or chemical restraints, and the rights to privacy and confidentiality. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i)-(iv). The Act further provides that funding recipients must permit each resident to remain in the facility and must not transfer or discharge the resident without cause. § 1396r(c)(2)(A). Recipients must also adopt procedures for residents to assert these rights and to otherwise voice grievances with respect to their treatment or care. § 1396r(c)(1)(A)(vi).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,120,"The Act also imposes many requirements directly and uniquely upon participating States, including in a subsection  entitled State requirements relating to nursing facility requirements. § 1396r(e). For instance, States must establish procedures for residents to challenge transfer and discharge decisions and an appeals process for other determinations. §§ 1396r(e)(3) and (e)(7)(F). States are also required to certify non-state-run facilities' compliance with the Act's provisions by conducting annual surveys using protocols developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. § 1396r(g)(2)(A). If a State finds that a facility is not providing adequate care, it must conduct an extended survey. § 1396r(g)(2)(B). The Act also requires States to investigate resident complaints and perform onsite monitoring at previously noncompliant or potentially noncompliant facilities. § 1396r(g)(4)(B). And, if it finds a violation that jeopardizes the health or safety of a facility's residents, the State shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies. § 1396r(h)(1)(A).1",Thomas,0,
2022-017,121,"FNHRA's scheme is illustrative of many modern federal spending programs, which often impose obligations directly on States as a condition of funding. For example, as a condition on highway funding, the Clean Air Act requires States to draft State implementation plans if their metropolitan areas fail to satisfy national ambient air quality standards. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7410 and 7509(a)-(b). Among other requirements, these plans must include emission limitations, compliance timetables, source monitoring, permitting systems, enforcement programs, and public participation. See § 7410(a)(2). Other examples, spanning virtually every domain of national and state policy, abound.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,122,"The ubiquity of such spending conditions, combined with the Federal Government's overwhelming financial heft, has made Spending Clause legislation an extraordinarily potent instrument of federal control.2 Congress and federal agencies regularly use conditions to direct state and local governments in their regulatory and spending policies. P. Hamburger, Purchasing Submission 139 (2021) (Hamburger). As a result, the priorities and programs of state and local governments have increasingly come to reflect federal decisions, to the point that the States have virtually become disaggregated sites  of national governance, not separate sovereigns. Id., at 141 (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the profound consequences of spending conditions for the Nation's governance and the fundamental shift that they have wrought in our federalist system, a sound understanding of their constitutional basis and permissible legal effects is essential.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,124,"This case presents one aspect of that question: whether spending conditions that impose obligations on States for the benefit of third parties may be enforced under § 1983. That statute provides a cause of action against any person who, under color of state law, deprives the plaintiff of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws. Accordingly, for the violation of a federal statutory provision to give rise to a cognizable § 1983 claim, the provision must confer rights, privileges, or immunities that are secured by  law. This Court's cases make clear that a right is secured by law in the relevant sense if, and only if, federal law imposes a binding obligation on the defendant to respect a corresponding substantive right that belongs to the plaintiff.3",Thomas,0,
2022-017,125,"In Thiboutot, the Court held that the plain language of § 1983 undoubtedly embraces a claim that the defendant violated a spending-power statute, reasoning that the phrase `and laws'  means what it says and is not limited to some subset of laws. 448 U.S. at 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502. The Court unquestioningly follows Thiboutot's logic today.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,126,"It is obvious, however, that conditional spending legislation does not function— and, in particular, does not secure rights—like laws enacted under Congress' enumerated legislative powers, such as the Commerce Clause. The latter, which I will refer to as sovereign legislative or regulatory powers, include powers to directly impose obligations, duties, prohibitions, and the like on individuals and entities beyond the Federal Government, and hence to secure corresponding rights in the persons and entities to which such obligations are owed. Laws that Congress enacts pursuant to its regulatory powers are binding on the regulated parties and pre-empt contrary state law of their own force. Whatever rights such laws secure, those rights are secured by the  laws themselves. § 1983.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,127,"By contrast, legislation that conditions a State's receipt of federal funds on compliance with certain requirements imposes no obligations and secures no rights of its own force. The stated conditions simply have no effect and do not arguably secure any rights (by law or otherwise) unless and until they are freely accepted by the State. Not only that, the Executive Branch can prevent the conditions from taking effect  by rejecting a State's application to participate in the spending program, and it can terminate their effect by cutting off a State's participation for noncompliance with the conditions. In addition, States can opt out of spending programs, completely nullifying whatever force the spending conditions once had. This alone suggests that spending conditions do not operate with the force of federal law, as Congress' legislative powers cannot be avoided by simply opting out. D. Engdahl, The Contract Thesis of the Federal Spending Power, 52 S. D. L. Rev. 496, 498 (2007) (emphasis deleted), see also Townsend v. Swank, 404 U.S. 282, 292, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971) (BURGER, C. J., concurring in result) (Adherence to the provisions of spending statutes is in no way mandatory upon the States under the Supremacy Clause).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,128,"Indeed, spending conditions like those in FNHRA do not function as laws enacted under Congress' regulatory powers, and, if they did, they would unconstitutionally commandeer the States to administer federal programs ranging from welfare, to healthcare, to air quality, and much more. Such conditions are thus constitutional, if at all, only if understood as setting forth the terms of a federal-state contract, rather than as binding federal law imposing legally enforceable obligations of its own force. In holding that FNHRA secures rights by federal law, the majority ignores the contractual understanding of spending conditions and, by doing so, calls their very constitutionality into question.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,130,"As noted earlier, a defining characteristic of modern spending legislation is the imposition of obligations on States that accept federal funds. Understanding a State's breach of such obligations as akin to violating rights secured by federal law is incompatible with this Court's anticommandeering doctrine. Under this bedrock constitutional principle, Congress generally cannot directly regulate the States or require them to implement federal programs.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,131,"When the original States declared their independence, they claimed the powers inherent in sovereignty. Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1461, 1475, 200 L.Ed.2d 854 (2018) (citing Declaration of Independence ¶32).4 Later, in ratifying the Constitution, the people of the original States granted carefully enumerated legislative powers to the new Federal Congress, while preserving the States' pre-existing legislative power. 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct. at 1476. Conspicuously absent from Congress' enumerated powers was the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,132,"Thus, as this Court has made clear, the Constitution confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 166, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992).5 As a corollary, Congress may not  conscript state governments as its agents, nor can it require the States to govern according to its instructions. Id., at 162, 178, 112 S.Ct. 2408. And, whatever the outer limits of state sovereignty may be, one thing is clear: The Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. Id., at 188, 112 S.Ct. 2408.6",Thomas,0,
2022-017,133,"Yet that is precisely what many spending conditions require the State to do. Spending conditions like FNHRA's are nothing more than commands to States, qua States, to administer federal benefits programs on terms dictated by Congress. Such conditions cannot be treated as having the force of federal law imposing direct obligations on the States and securing correlative rights of private parties without violating the anticommandeering doctrine.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,134,"It is no answer that the States consent to direct regulation by agreeing to the spending conditions in return for federal dollars. As the Court held in New York, where Congress exceeds its authority relative to the States,  the departure from the constitutional plan cannot be ratified by the `consent' of state officials. Id., at 182, 112 S.Ct. 2408. Because the people have surrendered only limited and enumerated powers to the Federal Government, the States and Congress cannot jointly circumvent the ratification and amendment process by agreeing to the enlargement of the powers of Congress beyond those enumerated in the Constitution. Ibid. The Federal Government cannot buy (or rent) the States' power to implement a federal program and then regard the conditions that the States are implementing themselves as having the force of federal law.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,136,"Of course, it is ultimately the States' consent that gives effect to conditions in spending legislation, but it does so in an entirely different manner from an illicit expansion of Congress' regulatory powers. Rather, as the Court observed in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981), legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract. Id., at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531. A federal statute imposing conditions upon the receipt of federal funding does not enact those conditions with the obligation of law, it merely proposes them as the terms of a contractual promise. Hamburger 132. Such spending provisions merely stipulate what the government expects from recipients if it is to pay them or, later, not withhold further payment and demand its money back. Ibid. Thus, even when fully recited in statutes, federal conditions do not come with legal obligation. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,137,"Further, and as already noted, the conditions in spending legislation only come into force upon the acceptance of another party. Such conditions are thus obligatory only by virtue of such agreement and not by force of law. D. Engdahl, The Spending Power, 44 Duke L. J. 1, 104 (1994). To be sure, it is a statute that prescribes the  funding condition and requires denial of federal assistance if the funding condition is not agreed to. Ibid. But, only the agreement—and not the statute—makes the terms obligatory on the funds recipient and thus `secures' the contemplated third-party rights. Ibid.7 Accordingly, such third-party rights  are `secured' (if at all) not by any `law,' but only by the contract between the recipient and the United States. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,138,"This contractual understanding of conditional spending legislation is much more than a mere analogy, it is the only possible explanation for why such legislation is not an unconstitutional direct regulation of the States. To deny or downplay this principle is to seek to have it both ways. Much spending legislation conditions States' receipt of federal funds on their undertaking obligations with respect to third parties. For such legislation to survive a federalism challenge, it must not directly impose obligations on the States with the force of federal law. But, for those conditions to be enforceable under § 1983, they must secure third-party rights by directly imposing correlative obligations on the States with the force of federal law. Both of these things cannot be true.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,140,"This contractual understanding of spending conditions is also a necessary consequence of the limited nature of Congress' spending power, as consistently understood for nearly two centuries of our Nation's history. Indeed, this is one point on which the Framers all seem to have agreed. Despite heated debates over the source and scope of Congress' power to spend, all understood that this power did not carry with it any independent regulatory authority. That agreement persisted throughout the 19th century. And, in the 20th, it was a critical underpinning of this Court's precedents upholding expansive uses of the spending power as consistent with Congress' limited legislative powers and our federalist system of government.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,142,"At the outset, while Congress undoubtedly possesses the power to direct the expenditure of federal funds, it is important to note that the Constitution contains no spending clause. From the beginning, some have located the spending power in the General Welfare Clause, and that view has generally been accepted by this Court's modern doctrine. See Engdahl, 44 Duke L. J., at 53, and n. 220 (describing Alexander Hamilton's views), South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). Yet, there are serious problems with that view.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,143,"The General Welfare Clause is simply part of the Taxing Clause, which reads in  relevant part: The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. Art. 1, § 8, cl. 1. By its terms, the only authority vested by this text is a power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises. This power is then qualified by the Debts and General Welfare Clauses, which limit the objects for which Congress can exercise that power. The General Welfare Clause is thus most naturally read as a qualification on the substantive taxing power.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,144,"Consider also that the General Welfare Clause references not only the general Welfare but also the common Defence. If the Clause were construed as an affirmative grant of power to spend for the common defense, it would make redundant Congress' powers to raise and support Armies and to provide and maintain a Navy, also found in Article I, § 8, cls. 12-13. Thus, if the reference to `common Defence' spending simply alludes to power conferred elsewhere, then it seems illogical to consider the terms general Welfare as the source of a freestanding power to spend for whatever purposes. D. Engdahl, The Basis of the Spending Power, 18 Seattle U. L. Rev. 215, 222 (1995).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,145,"The Taxing Clause is also a strange candidate for the source of a general congressional spending power because it fails to provide any authority at all to spend money acquired otherwise than by taxation. Ibid. Yet, the federal treasury receives money from many other sources, including penalties, fines, user fees, leases, surplus property sales, gifts, bequests, and returns on investments. Ibid. And those sums are a pittance in comparison to those raised under Congress' Borrowing Clause power, see Art. I., § 8, cl. 2, which has always been one of the major sources of federal funds. Unless federal spending on credit and from revenues not derived from Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises is unconstitutional, the General Welfare Clause cannot be the source of Congress' spending power.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,146,"The Clause certainly is not an independent grant of regulatory power to legislate for the general welfare, as the history of the Constitution's framing and ratification makes clear. The Philadelphia Convention initially adopted a resolution that Congress be authorized `to legislate in all cases for the general interests of the Union, and also in those to which the States are separately incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual legislation.' J. Renz, What Spending Clause? (Or the President's Paramour), 33 John Marshall L. Rev. 81, 104 (1999) (Renz). But the Convention later abandoned this vesting of a broad power to legislate for the general welfare in favor of the enumeration of specific federal legislative powers and the creation of a taxing power limited by the General Welfare Clause. See R. Natelson, The General Welfare Clause and the Public Trust: An Essay in Original Understanding, 52 Kan. L. Rev. 1, 23-29 (2003) (Natelson), see also Renz 104-105 (counting five instances in which the Convention considered and rejected attempts to insert a grant of general legislative power into the Constitution).8  Consistent with its text, Federalist advocates of the Constitution defended the General Welfare Clause to the ratifying public as nothing more than a limitation on the taxing power. See, e.g., 3 Debates on the Constitution 207 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (Elliot's Debates) (E. Randolph, Virginia Convention) (The plain and obvious meaning of this is, that no more duties, taxes, imposts, and excises, shall be laid, than are sufficient to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare, of the United States), N. Webster, An Examination Into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution, in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States 50 (P. Ford ed. 1888) (In the very clause which gives the power of levying duties and taxes, the purposes to which the money shall be appropriated are specified, viz. to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States), see also Natelson 47-49. Their basic message was that the language in question was not a grant at all— rather it was a restriction on federal authority. Id., at 39. As Governor Randolph emphatically declared: Is this an independent, separate, substantive power, to provide for the general welfare of the United States? No, sir. 3 Elliot's Debates 466.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,147,"Federalists went out of their way to specifically disclaim that the General Welfare Clause would vest any independent regulatory power. For example, James Madison expressly rejected Anti-Federalist attempts to portray the General Welfare Clause as granting an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare. The Federalist No. 41, p. 262 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Similarly, in rebutting Patrick Henry's warning that the Clause would vest a regulatory power, Governor Randolph observed: You must violate every rule of construction and common sense, if you sever it from the power of raising money, and annex it to anything else, in order to make it that formidable power which it is represented to be. 3 Elliot's Debates 600. Again and again, leading Federalists represented the General Welfare Clause simply as qualifying the fiscal power. E. Corwin, The Spending Power of Congress —Apropos the Maternity Act, 36 Harv. L. Rev. 548, 552 (1923) (citing The Federalist Nos. 30 and 34 (A. Hamilton), and 41 (J. Madison)). It was generally understood by the Constitution's ratifiers that the General Welfare Clause did not confer power to regulate, such regulatory powers were conferred only by specific enumerations such as the Commerce Clause. T. Sky, To Provide for the General Welfare 67 (2003) (Sky).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,148,"Thus, even if one implausibly regards the General Welfare Clause as a Spending Clause, it is unambiguous that the Clause confers no independent regulatory power. Importantly, the same holds for every other plausible textual anchor for Congress' general spending power. First, the Necessary and Proper Clause is a natural candidate for the spending power because spending funds may be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the Federal Government's enumerated powers. Art. I., § 8, cl. 18, see G. Lawson & G. Seidman, The Constitution of Empire 30 (2004) (Lawson & Seidman) (This `Sweeping Clause'  unquestionably includes the power to enact spending laws that are `necessary and proper' for effectuating federal powers), K. Stith, Congress' Power of the Purse, 97 Yale L. J. 1343, 1348 (1988) (arguing that the Necessary and Proper Clause includes the power to  spend public funds on authorized federal activities). But, because the Clause authorizes only those spending measures that are `necessary and proper for carrying into Execution' other enumerated federal powers, Congress can  spend only if the appropriation is tied to the execution of one of the federal government's granted powers. Lawson & Seidman 30. The Clause thus does not provide a stand-alone grant of spending authority, and certainly not an authority to spend for a nonspecific `general welfare of the United States.' Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,149,"A second plausible source of the spending power is the Property Clause, which provides that Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. The term other Property may comprehend personal property no less than real, and personal property includes money, as well as financial assets of all kinds. Engdahl, 18 Seattle U. L. Rev., at 250 (emphasis deleted). But the power to dispose of funds does not carry with it any regulatory power, the Property Clause only authorizes the control and disposition of federal property and does not disturb the allocation of governance authority otherwise accomplished under the principle of enumerated powers. Id., at 251. Thus, when disposing of federal property under the Property Clause, Congress has no more competence to make `law' than any private donor or testator has. Engdahl, 44 Duke L. Rev., at 104.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,151,"In the early decades after ratification, both the source and the scope of the spending power were hotly contested, usually in debates over internal improvements such as roads and canals. One side, represented by Madison, maintained that federal spending must be strictly in aid of the Federal Government's specifically enumerated powers—for instance, expenditures to construct a road would be justified only if the road could be constructed under the Post Roads Clause or some other enumerated power. See Renz 108-119, see also J. Eastman, Restoring the General to the General Welfare Clause, 4 Chap. L. Rev. 63, 72 (2001). As this side of the debate also took a narrow view of the enumerated powers, it generally argued that the Federal Government could not fund internal improvements without a constitutional amendment. See Sky 140-141. The other camp, associated with the nationalist views of Hamilton and Joseph Story, understood the General Welfare Clause to include a very broad spending authority, which could be applied to purposes not specifically enumerated by the Constitution. Natelson 12, see also Renz 124-126.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,152,"Even this camp, however, understood that the General Welfare Clause does not include a power to regulate. Natelson 12, see also Sky 96. Hamilton, for example, made clear that the spending power did not imply a power to do whatever else should appear to Congress conducive to the general welfare. Report on the Subject of Manufactures 37 (1791). As he further elaborated, a power to appropriate money does not carry a power to do any other thing, not authorized in the Constitution, either expressly or by fair implication. Ibid. Instead, any regulatory authority had to be tethered to some independent regulatory power. Thus, under this view, Congress could spend money on roads and canals unconnected with the enumerated powers, but it would have to depend on the States for any regulatory legislation needed to complete and preserve the improvements.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,153,"This understanding that the spending power itself extended only to the application of money, ibid. (emphasis in original), led Hamilton to favor a constitutional amendment empowering Congress to open canals. Letter from A. Hamilton to J. Dayton (1799), in 10 Works of Alexander Hamilton 334 (H. Lodge ed. 1904). After all, opening canals involved much more than spending money: it involved acquiring rights of way and constructing and operating the improvements. Engdahl, 44 Duke L. Rev., at 23. Thus, it was precisely the insufficiency of the spending power to override state law obstacles to achieving the targeted end that made Hamilton conclude that a constitutional amendment for canals was necessary. Id., at 24. Federal funding alone could not override incompatible or adverse state policies. Ibid. As this example demonstrates, even those who held the broadest conception of the spending power recognized that it was only a power to spend, not a power to impose binding requirements with the force of federal law. See Sky 95.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,154,"The limited nature of the spending power was also a rare point of agreement in Hamilton and Jefferson's bitter quarrel over the constitutionality of a national bank. Reflecting the ratification era understanding of the General Welfare Clause, Jefferson observed that the laying of taxes is the power and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised. Opinion on the Constitutionality of the Bill for Establishing a National Bank (Feb. 15, 1791), in 19 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 277 (J. Boyd ed. 1974) (emphasis in original). If the General Welfare Clause went beyond describing the purpose of the Taxing Clause and represented a distinct and independent power to do any act Congress may please, which might be for the good of the Union, it would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless. Ibid., accord, J. Madison, The Bank Bill (Feb. 2, 1791), in 13 Papers of James Madison 375 (C. Hobson & R. Rutland eds. 1981) (interpreting the General Welfare Clause as a distinct power would supersede all the powers reserved to the state governments). In response, Hamilton justified the bank based on Congress' enumerated powers, such as the Commerce and Taxing Clauses. Opinion on the Constitutionality of an Act To Establish a Bank (Feb. 23, 1791), in 8 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 97 (H. Syrett ed. 1965). He discussed the General Welfare Clause only as a limitation: It is true, that Congress cannot without breach of trust, lay taxes for any other purpose than the general welfare. Id., at 129. In his view, the spending power was emphatically limited to the application of money. Ibid. (emphasis in original). Jefferson and Hamilton could agree that it was no independent font of legislative power.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,155,"In sum, the Framers and Ratifiers understood the Taxing and General Welfare Clause as granting only a power to tax. What our modern cases refer to as the Spending Clause—in fact, the General Welfare Clause—was understood by the Framers and the ratifying public as granting no regulatory authority. One thing that the opposing men and factions of the founding generation agreed upon was that the Federal Government's power to spend was just that—a power to spend, involving no regulatory authority. Instead, the power to bind with the force of law must come from Congress' enumerated legislative powers rather than its spending power.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,157,"Though the scope and source of the spending power continued to be vigorously contested into the 19th century, the fundamental understanding that federal spending measures could not bind with the force  of law remained common ground. For example, in his last official act, President Madison vetoed an internal improvements bill in part because the train of powers incident to constructing and maintaining such improvements were beyond Congress' enumerated powers. 30 Annals of Cong. 211, 212 (1817). The General Welfare Clause could not provide the needed regulatory authority, as such an interpretation would have the effect of giving to Congress a general power of legislation, thus rendering the Constitution's special and careful enumeration of powers  nugatory and improper. Id., at 212. That the bill required state consent was likewise insufficient because, if the power be not possessed by Congress, the assent of the States  cannot confer the power. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,158,"Upon assuming office, President James Monroe sent a message to Congress agreeing with Madison's views, the message was then referred to a special Committee in the House of Representatives led by Congressman Henry Tucker. Corwin, 36 Harv. L. Rev., at 559-560. The Tucker Committee produced an exhaustive report on internal improvements, which disagreed with nearly every aspect of Madison and Monroe's position. Id., at 560-561. Significantly, however, the Committee agreed that the General Welfare Clause did not vest the power needed to make internal improvements, relying instead on the Constitution's specific enumerations such as the Post Roads Clause. 31 Annals of Cong. 454 (1817) (disavowing any use of the general phrase in the Constitution to provide for the common defence and general welfare, as applicable to the enumeration of powers, or as extending the power of Congress beyond the specified powers). The Tucker Committee also agreed with President Monroe that the spending power did not extend the specified or incidental powers of the Government or allow Congress to exercise any jurisdictional i.e., regulatory rights over improvements. Id., at 459-460. Thus, if the power to make a road or dig a canal is not given by one of Congress' enumerated regulatory powers, the power of appropriating money cannot confer it. Id., at 459.9",Thomas,0,
2022-017,159,"In his second term, President Monroe set forth the fullest exposition of the understanding that the spending power involved no regulatory authority. In 1822, Congress passed a bill to establish a system of internal improvements, asserting the power to establish turnpikes with gates and tolls, and to enforce the collection of tolls by federal penalties. Sky 147 (internal quotation marks omitted). President Monroe then vetoed the measure, judging that Congress' spending authority did not extend to such a complete right of jurisdiction and sovereignty for all the purposes of internal improvement, and not merely the right of applying money under the power vested in Congress to make appropriations. 2 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 1789-1908, p. 142 (J. Richardson ed. 1897) (Richardson). Because Monroe understood that Congress does not possess this power and the States individually can not grant it, he agreed with Madison and Hamilton that the power can be granted only by an amendment to the Constitution. Id., at 143.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,160,"To explain his veto, President Monroe sent Congress an extensive report entitled  Views of the President of the United States on the Subject of Internal Improvements. In this report—perhaps the most elaborate constitutional discussion ever sent to the Capitol from the White House—Monroe synthesized the understanding of the spending power from the founding of the Republic. L. Rogers, The Postal Power of Congress 75 (1916). And, in doing so, he largely settled the contours of that understanding for over a century.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,161,"In the centerpiece of the Views, Monroe explained that the spending power carries no incidental power to regulate individuals or States. Echoing Hamilton, Monroe understood the spending power to consist of a right to appropriate the public money, and nothing more. Richardson 162. It carries with it no incidental power, nor does it draw after it any consequences of that kind. Id., at 168. Monroe proceeded to carefully distinguish the spending power from Congress' authority to impose obligations and duties: The use or application of the money after it is raised is a power altogether of a different character from Congress' enumerated regulatory powers such as the taxing power, it imposes no burden on the people, nor can it act on them in a sense to take power from the States. Id., at 164.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,162,"Applying this understanding of the spending power to the question of internal improvements, Monroe explained that Congress could only appropriate the money necessary to make them. Id., at 168. Where none of Congress' enumerated regulatory powers was applicable, Monroe concluded, for every act requiring legislative sanction or support the State authority must be relied on. Ibid. Thus, Congress could not itself pass laws providing for the condemnation of the land,  the establishment of turnpikes and tolls, and the protection of the work when finished. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,163,"Monroe's summation of the federal spending power, reflecting that it does not carry with it any regulatory power, was accepted throughout the 19th century by friends and foes of federal power alike. In his 1825 inaugural address, President John Quincy Adams explained that Monroe's Views had conciliated the sentiments and approximated the opinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power. Inaugural Address, Mar. 4, 1825, in 5 American State Papers, Foreign Relations 753, 755 (1858). Five years later, President Andrew Jackson vetoed the Maysville Road Bill of 1830 for the same reasons Monroe had vetoed the Cumberland Road Bill of 1822: Congress lacks the right to exercise as much jurisdiction as is necessary to preserve the works and to raise funds by the collection of tolls to keep them in repair, and without such power nothing extensively useful can be effected. Richardson 492.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,164,"Justice Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution also recognized that the spending power did not carry with it any auxiliary power to bind individuals or States. Citing Monroe's Views liberally, Story agreed that Congress could not enact a system of internal improvements under the General Welfare Clause. Although he located the spending power in that Clause, Story understood that the power was confined to mere appropriations of money, and that, as a result, the Federal Government could not regulate internal improvements except pursuant to its legislative enumerated powers. 3 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, § 1269, p. 150 (1833), see also Sky 224 (As read by Story, the General Welfare Clause did not constitute a regulatory power, independent of the spending power, authorizing Congress to enact whatever measures it wished  under an unlimited  power to legislate for the general welfare of the United States).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,165,"Although disagreement on whether Congress could spend for purposes beyond the enumerated powers persisted through the Antebellum and Reconstruction eras, the understanding that the spending power did not imply regulatory power persisted. See generally Sky 232-240, 270-291. Because Congress was acting solely under its power to spend, it relied on the States' acceptance of terms and upon the States' legislative powers to carry out federal spending programs.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,167,"Given this consensus, it is not surprising that the first federal grant-in-aid spending programs were contractual in nature. The Morrill Act of 1862, perhaps the first such program, extended an offer to the States to accept donations of federal lands on the condition that the State use the land to establish a college. 12 Stat. 504-505. States had two years to accept the federal terms in the form of an Act by the State's legislature. Id., at 505 Significantly, the only consequence for a State's breach of the use condition was contractual in nature—the grant to such State shall cease, and said State shall be bound to pay the United States the amount received of any lands previously sold. Id., at 504-505. The Second Morrill Act, enacted in 1890, followed the same framework, donating money for the endowment of agricultural and mechanical arts colleges, subject to the condition that black students not be excluded. Ch. 841, 26 Stat. 417. Like the First Morrill Act, the only consequence for noncompliance was that future appropriations under the Act would cease until the State brought itself into compliance. Id., at 419.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,168,"In the early 20th century, the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment and the national income tax vastly expanded the revenue available to the Federal Government. But the increasingly ambitious spending programs that followed did not break the contractual pattern established by the Morrill Acts. Thus, early-20th-century highway grants took the form of an offer to enter a contract, with the consequence of noncompliance being the cutoff of federal funds. See Corwin, 36 Harv. L. Rev., at 574, n. 72 (describing Federal Highway Act of 1916), see also id., at 573-575 (collecting other examples).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,169,"Even in the New Deal era, advocates of far-reaching spending programs continued to understand the spending power as a mere power of appropriation. Professor Corwin, for example, recognized that the States must be depended upon to exercise the legislative power needed to implement such programs. Thus, federal highway construction relied on the state power of eminent domain, as well as on state power to police and protect highways during and after their construction. National-State Cooperation—Its Present Possibilities, 46 Yale L. J. 599, 617 (1937). Similarly, national protection of forests depended on the power of the states to regulate the conduct of persons entering forests, and the provision of maternity benefits depended on the power of the cooperating states to compel birth registration, the licensing of mid-wives, etc. Ibid. Thus, more than 100 years after Monroe's Views, it was still well understood that the Federal Government's spending power needed to work with the wider coercive powers of the states to accomplish its ends. Ibid. And, a State's acceptance of federal funds in return for exercising its own powers did not expand the Federal Government's legislative powers.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,170,"In sum, from the framing of the Constitution to well into the 20th century, it was virtually undisputed that Congress' spending power was nothing more than a power  to spend. It included no regulatory authority to bind parties, to secure rights or impose duties with the force of federal law, and no authority to directly regulate the States even with their consent.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,172,"When cases concerning expansive federal spending programs first began to reach this Court, they vividly illustrated both the enduring understanding of the spending power as a nonregulatory power and the contractual understanding of spending conditions. The Federal Government defended major spending programs on the basis of that understanding, and the programs survived this Court's review only because of those traditional premises.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,173,"In Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), the Court rejected as nonjusticiable Massachusetts' claim that the Maternity Act of 1921 was an attempt to legislate outside the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution and within the field of local powers exclusively reserved to the States. Id., at 482, 43 S.Ct. 597. The Court first stated that it probably  would be sufficient to point out that the powers of the State are not invaded, since the statute imposes no obligation but simply extends an option which the State is free to accept or reject. Id., at 480, 43 S.Ct. 597. In other words, the State could not be injured because the Act was not a direct legal regulation. Rather, it was a mere offer to bargain—it imposed no burden  upon the States and did not require them to do or to yield anything of its own force. Id., at 482, 43 S.Ct. 597. The State could not seek judicial redress because the contractual nature of the Act's provisions meant that States could vindicate their own rights by the simple expedient of not yielding. Ibid., see also Corwin, 36 Harv. L. Rev., at 579 (noting that the Maternity Act adhered to the traditional requirements of state consent and the general caveat against jurisdictional rights following in the wake of appropriations). The Justices in Mellon understood that Congress' power to spend money is not a legislative power. Engdahl, 52 S. D. L. Rev., at 498 (emphasis in original).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,174,"Cases involving New Deal spending programs teach the same lesson. For example, United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 312, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936), concerned the constitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which offered subsidies to farmers not to sell crops. The Government defended the Act on the ground that it did not regulate any private or state party. Instead, any commands or restrictions in the Act were imposed only upon the use by federal administrative officials of the money granted. Brief for United States in United States v. Butler, O. T. 1935, No. 401, p. 264. In line with the traditional distinction between mere spending and regulatory commands, the Government urged that Congress had not gone beyond its power of authorizing an expenditure precisely because it had not sought to force or command citizens to receive the money offered and to perform the conditions upon which the funds are to be disbursed. Id., at 265. The Government expressly relied on the contractual nature of the Act's conditions, as distinct from any exercise of sovereign regulation:",Thomas,0,
2022-017,175,"It would be most unusual to suppose that a contract of this nature, entered into freely by both parties, is an exercise of sovereign regulation and control over one of the parties or over the subject matter with which the contract deals . The rights of the United States under the contracts are no greater than would be the rights of a private citizen under similar contracts, and enforcement must be by ordinary judicial  process according to the law of the forum. The contracts are not derogatory of any sovereign rights of the States, they are carried out pursuant to and under the protection of the laws of the States . The purpose and effect of the contracts so entered into are simply to accomplish the spending of the money on the conditions imposed by Congress, and in authorizing execution of such contracts Congress was not exerting a power outside of the field of appropriation. Id., at 266-267.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,176,"The Government also disclaimed that the Act would have pre-emptive effect: Because it went no further than offering benefits to those who comply with certain conditions, States remained as free after the passage of this Act as before to pass laws rendering it impossible for any of their inhabitants to comply with such conditions. Id., at 268. Thus, to avoid a Tenth Amendment problem, the Government relied on the traditional distinction between the Federal Government's power to spend and its power to regulate:",Thomas,0,
2022-017,177,The distinction between an application of the Federal lawmaking power to enforce compliance with the desire of Congress and the use of the spending power to offer benefits which might persuade people to that end was recognized in this manner by the first Congresses.,Thomas,0,
2022-017,179,"When the United States goes no further than extending benefits to citizens who arrange their affairs in a manner thought beneficial by Congress, there is no direct exercise of Federal power on those affairs and they remain subject to the unhampered control of the States. Consequently, in a case of this nature, the effect which the Act of Congress will have in a State is dependent entirely upon the voluntary action of that State and its inhabitants. Id., at 274, 276.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,180,"In deciding the case, the Court took the Government's concessions as given, stating, it is not contended that the General Welfare Clause grants power to regulate agricultural production. Butler, 297 U.S., at 64, 56 S.Ct. 312. The Court then agreed with Justice Story's observation that the only thing granted is the power to tax for the purpose of providing funds for payment of the nation's debts and making provision for the general welfare. Ibid. Congress' spending power, even if located in the General Welfare Clause, conferred no regulatory power.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,181,"The Court proceeded to hold the Act unconstitutional precisely because it was, in reality, a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. Id., at 68, 56 S.Ct. 312. That was because the regulation was not in fact voluntary, as it would lead to financial ruin for farmers who refused the Act's benefits. Id., at 70-71, 56 S.Ct. 312. Confirming another aspect of the traditional doctrine, the Court held that even the purely voluntary consent of private parties could not expand Congress' limited regulatory powers. Id., at 74-75, 56 S.Ct. 312.10  The challenge to the Social Security Act in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed. 1279 (1937), followed a similar pattern but reached the opposite result based on a different level of perceived coercion. As in Butler, the Federal Government defended a federal statute —here, the Social Security Act—by representing that conditions on the grant of federal funds are not regulatory in nature and are thus within the spending power. Brief for United States in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, O. T. 1936, No. 837, p. 135. Seeking to avoid a repeat of its loss in Butler, the Government argued that the program was also not regulatory in fact because it did not coerce States to take or refrain from taking any actions. Brief for United States in Steward Machine Co. 100, 105-106.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,182,"This time, the Court agreed with the Government, finding that the Act was not coercive and thus did not go beyond the bounds of Congress' spending power. Steward Machine Co., 301 U.S., at 591-592, 57 S.Ct. 883. Then, in rejecting a federalism challenge to the measure, the Court observed that once the State accepted the federal conditions, it was bound with even lesser force than an ordinary contract. Id., at 594-595, 57 S.Ct. 883. The State was still free, without breach of an agreement, to change her system over night. Id., at 595, 57 S.Ct. 883. No officer or agency of the national Government could force a compensation law upon her or keep it in existence, nor could they supervise or control the application of the payments. Ibid.11",Thomas,0,
2022-017,183,"The Court again demonstrated its adherence to the traditional view in Oklahoma v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 330 U.S. 127, 67 S.Ct. 544, 91 L.Ed. 794 (1947). There, the U. S. Civil Service Commission determined that an Oklahoma highway commissioner had violated the Hatch Act, pledging to withhold a portion of the State's highway grants equal to two years' of the commissioner's compensation if the State failed to remove him. Oklahoma challenged the Commission's order and the Act on which it was based as an illicit attempt to regulate the State's internal affairs. Id., at 133, 67 S.Ct. 544. Citing Mellon, the Court held that the Act was valid because it did not directly regulate the State, which had adopted the `simple expedient' of not yielding by refusing to remove its highway commissioner. 330 U.S. at 143, 67 S.Ct. 544.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,184,"Thus, to defend these spending programs in the first half of the 20th century, the Government relied on the long-settled understanding that the power to spend carries with it no sovereign legislative power to create rights and duties. To the contrary, the Government represented that these programs had the binding force, at most, of contracts. They did not pre-empt, nor did they bind States with the force of law, they merely spent federal  dollars upon conditions, the violation of which entitled the Government to cease further payments. The Court took this position as a given, and the contractual nature of spending conditions is precisely what saved them from constitutional challenge.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,185,"In sum, the historical record is clear and consistent on a critical proposition: The spending power is the power to spend only. Any duties imposed by regulatory legislation, and any correlative rights secured by law, must find their source in one of Congress' enumerated powers or the legislative powers of the States. Congress' spending power cannot secure rights by law.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,187,"The contractual nature of spending conditions was taken as a given until the second half of the 20th century, when individuals first began to bring § 1983 suits premised on violations of conditions contained within spending statutes (usually, the Social Security Act). From the enactment of § 1983's predecessor statute in 1871 to the Court's decision in Thiboutot in 1980, this Court had never held that § 1983 was available to redress any and all violations of federal legislation. Indeed, there were almost no square holdings concerning the precise scope of the statutory rights vindicable by § 1983. Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600, 645, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979) (POWELL, J., concurring), see also Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560, 561-566 (CA2 1969) (FRIENDLY, J.). Perhaps the only such square holding was that of Holt v. Indiana Mfg. Co., 176 U.S. 68, 20 S.Ct. 272, 44 L.Ed. 374 (1900), which narrowly construed § 1983's predecessor statute to refer to civil rights only, making it inapplicable in a suit based on the federal patent laws. Id., at 72, 20 S.Ct. 272.12",Thomas,0,
2022-017,188,"The traditional understanding of both the spending power and § 1983 began slowly eroding in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, culminating in Thiboutot. On the spending-power side, the Court held in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), that the spending conditions of Title IX of the Education Amendments created binding duties on private universities, the violation of which could be the ground of a federal lawsuit by a private party. In doing so, the Court simply ignored the crucial difference between restraints accepted as conditions of funding, and restraints imposed by virtue of a legislative power. Engdahl, 52 S. D. L. Rev., at 509. And, on the § 1983 side, the Court had considered a number of suits against state officials for violations of the Social Security Act without analyzing their cognizability under  § 1983. See Thiboutot, 448 U.S., at 6, 100 S.Ct. 2502 (collecting cases), id., at 26, 100 S.Ct. 2502 (POWELL, J., dissenting) (Far from being a long-accepted fact, purely statutory § 1983 actions are an invention of the last 20 years).",Thomas,0,
2022-017,189,"The stage was thus set for Thiboutot to discard nearly two centuries of settled spending-power doctrine by holding that federal spending conditions secure rights by law. Ignoring both the contractual nature of spending programs and the enforcement-power-based understanding of § 1983, Thiboutot declared that the plain language of the statute undoubtedly embraced respondents' claim that the State violated the Social Security Act. Id., at 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502 (majority opinion). The centerpiece of the Court's opinion was its imprecise framing of the relevant question: whether the phrase `and laws,' as used in § 1983, means what it says, or whether it should be limited to some subset of laws. Ibid. After framing the issue thus, the Court reasoned that nothing in the legislative history compelled limiting the term and laws to civil rights laws enacted under the Reconstruction Amendments. See id., at 6-8, 100 S.Ct. 2502.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,190,"But the Court's opinion completely missed the deeper conceptual question whether spending-power statutes can ever impose obligations, and thus secure corresponding rights, with the force of federal law.13 As explained at length above, the limited nature of the spending power dictates a negative answer. And, a contrary understanding would transform the terms of federal-state agreements into binding regulations of state entities by federal law—violating the constitutional prohibition against directly regulating or commandeering the States.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,191,"It took less than a year after Thiboutot for the Court to realize the `constitutional difficulties' with imposing affirmative obligations on the States pursuant to the spending power and to take the first step toward ameliorating the problems with Thiboutot. Pennhurst, 451 U.S., at 17, n. 13, 101 S.Ct. 1531. In Pennhurst, the Court held that a provision of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (a conditional spending Act) could not be enforced against a state entity under § 1983. Id., at 18, 101 S.Ct. 1531. The Court first held that the provision could not be considered as enforcement legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 16-17, 101 S.Ct. 153014 The Court then explained the fundamentally  different natures of legislation under the Reconstruction Amendments and legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power, the latter of which is much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions. Id., at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531. Consistent with the traditional position, the Court also explained that in legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power, the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate the funds to the State. Id., at 28, 101 S.Ct. 1531. Ultimately, because the Pennhurst Court determined that the provision at issue was not intended to secure rights by imposing obligations on States, see id., at 22-27, 101 S.Ct. 1531, it did not need to confront the constitutional problem created by Thiboutot. Nonetheless, Pennhurst both recognized the problem and pointed to the solution—a return to the traditional contractual understanding that itself flows naturally from the limited nature of Congress' spending authority.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,192,"Without that understanding, however, it is unavoidable that spending conditions that impose substantive obligations on the States with the force of federal law are unconstitutional.15 As shown above, the federal spending power is nothing more than the power to spend. It neither contains nor implies any sovereign regulatory power to legislate rights and duties with the force of federal law, and the regulated party's consent cannot change that conclusion. The contractual nature of the spending power was essential to the Government's defense and this Court's approval of far-reaching spending programs, the programs survived only with that traditional understanding as a premise.16 The Federal Government and private litigants cannot now discard that understanding to argue that such programs impose obligations directly on the States that are enforceable against state and local officials under § 1983, without running headlong into the anticommandeering doctrine and long-recognized limitations on the federal spending power.* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-017,193,"By holding that FNHRA creates rights enforceable under § 1983, the majority creates a grave constitutional problem that cannot be brushed away with a mere incantation of Thiboutot. As explained above, spending-power legislation cannot secure rights by law. Conditions on a State's receipt of federal funds are effective, not by virtue of federal law, but by dint of a  federal-state agreement. The very constitutionality of such conditions depends on their eschewal of securing rights and imposing concomitant obligations on States.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,194,"The line from Mellon and Butler, to Thiboutot, to this case amounts to a constitutional bait and switch that cannot continue to be glossed over or ignored. In holding that spending conditions are not merely contractual, but can directly impose obligations on the States with the force of federal law, the Court unravels the very rationale for their constitutionality. Either conditions in statutes enacted under the spending power are in the nature of contract terms and do not secure rights by federal law, or they are unconstitutional because they exceed the spending power and illicitly commandeer the States. The consequence of the majority's rejection of the contractual understanding is not that spending conditions are enforceable under § 1983. Rather, it is that they are unconstitutional. It is well past time for this Court to re-examine Thiboutot and the nature of Congress' spending power.",Thomas,0,
2022-017,195,"Justice ALITO, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, dissenting.",Alito,0,
2022-017,196,"I agree with the Court's understanding of the high bar required to bring an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the violation of a federal statute, but I disagree with how that standard applies in this case. In my view, while respondent has established that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA) creates individual rights, petitioners have established that relief for the violation of those rights under § 1983 is foreclosed by the remedial scheme in the Act.",Alito,0,
2022-017,198,"The majority and Justice BARRETT correctly identify the plaintiff's burden under § 1983: a statute must unambiguously confer individual federal rights to create rights within the meaning of § 1983, and Gonzaga sets forth our established method for ascertaining unambiguous conferral. Ante, at 1455-1456, 1457 (majority opinion), see ante, at 1463-1464 (BARRETT, J., concurring), Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002). In other words, if Congress wishes to create new rights enforceable under § 1983, it must do so in clear and unambiguous terms. Id., at 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268. Because the standard demands no less and no more than what is required for Congress to create new rights enforceable under an implied private right of action, I also agree that there is no room for a multifactor balancing test to pick and choose which federal requirements may be enforced by § 1983 and which may not. Id., at 286, 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (emphasis added) (rejecting the standard articulated in Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-341, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997)). None of this is new ground. We have previously held that Gonzaga plainly repudiates the ready implication of a § 1983 action that our earlier decisions exemplified. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 330, n., 135 S.Ct. 1378, 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2015).",Alito,0,
2022-017,199,"The two FNHRA provisions that respondent invokes demonstrate what it takes to satisfy this demanding standard. First, the Act mandates that a nursing facility must protect and promote the rights of each resident, including  the right to be free from  chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat medical symptoms. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(c)(1)(A). Second, the Act protects transfer and discharge rights, precluding a nursing facility from transferring or discharging each resident except in  certain circumstances. § 1396r(c)(2)(A) (boldface deleted). Both of these provisions explicitly use the term rights to describe discrete and concrete duties that a defined party (nursing facility) owes to a particular individual (each resident). When these features are taken together, they satisfy the standard for determining whether a personal right exists. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S., at 285-286, 122 S.Ct. 2268, Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 288-289, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001).",Alito,0,
2022-017,202,"When determining whether individual rights are enforceable under § 1983, I again see much common ground with the majority and agree entirely with Justice BARRETT's explanation of the governing standard. That question boils down to what Congress intended, as divined from text and context. Ante, at 1459 (majority opinion). Notably, we have explicitly held that this standard does not demand anything close to the level of incompatibility required to trigger implied repeal. See Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120, and n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 1453, 161 L.Ed.2d 316 (2005), see ante, at 1463-1464 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). Instead, the question is simply whether the rights created by a later statute `may be asserted within the remedial framework' of the earlier one. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 120, n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 1453, see Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 375-378, 99 S.Ct. 2345, 60 L.Ed.2d 957 (1979). As the majority explains, § 1983 does not apply where Congress has created an individual right but also simultaneously given good reason (detectable with ordinary interpretive tools) to conclude that the § 1983 remedy is not available. Ante, at 1459, n. 13, see, e.g., Armstrong, 575 U.S., at 328, 135 S.Ct. 1378 (presumption of equitable remedies rebutted by administrative remedies and statutory requirements).",Alito,0,
2022-017,203,"Finally, I agree that there is no bright-line rule for when a statute evidences an intent to preclude § 1983 relief. See Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 122, 125 S.Ct. 1453, ante, at 1460-1461 (majority opinion), ante, at 1464 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). Courts should consider a wide range of contextual clues, like `enforcement provisions' that government officials can invoke and any `administrative remedies that the statute offers.' Ante, at 1464 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). Whatever the context, the more comprehensive the enforcement scheme in a statute, the less likely that it leaves the door open for § 1983 suits. Ibid. After all, when a statute `provides its own comprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements of that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed by bringing suit directly under § 1983.' Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 20, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981).",Alito,0,
2022-017,205,"When all is said and done, my disagreement with the majority is thus narrowly focused on how this standard applies to this case. In my view, FNHRA forecloses a private cause of action even though it admittedly creates substantive private rights. Alexander, 532 U.S., at 290, 121 S.Ct. 1511. The Act creates a reticulated remedial regime that both balances federal and state enforcement and channels disputes through that regime. Allowing § 1983 suits will upend this careful balance.",Alito,0,
2022-017,206,"Consider the remedial provisions that the Act provides. When federal officials find that a nursing home does not comply  with FNHRA, the Act enumerates certain limited remedies they can pursue, such as withdrawing federal funding and imposing civil penalties in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. § 1396r(h)(3)(C). FNHRA obligates States to establish certain remedies for noncompliance (including civil penalties), but otherwise leaves them free to specify criteria, as to when and how each of the required remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. § 1396r(h)(2)(A). It also empowers States to provide for other  remedies as they see fit. Ibid. Finally, the Act provides special rules where state and federal officials do not agree on a finding of noncompliance. § 1396r(h)(6) (boldface deleted).",Alito,0,
2022-017,207,"By specifying limited remedies for federal authorities and tasking States with otherwise determining the consequences for violations, the Act creates a clear division of authority that ensures States retain their historical control over nursing-home regulation. Allowing § 1983 suits will upset this balance by allowing any plaintiff to demand damages regardless of the remedial regime that States establish pursuant to their explicit authority under the Act. Moreover, whenever a plaintiff files suit, the determination about noncompliance will be taken away from federal and state authorities and given to courts. And because the remedies offered under § 1983 will often dwarf the relief available under FNHRA's reticulated balance of remedies, § 1983 will swallow the centralized state and federal review mechanisms the Act imposes.",Alito,0,
2022-017,208,"The exclusivity of FNHRA's enforcement regime is buttressed by the grievance remedy FNHRA gives to nursing-home residents. Residents have the right to voice grievances with respect to treatment or care and the right to prompt efforts by the facility to resolve grievances. § 1396r(c)(1)(A)(vi). States, in turn, are obligated to investigate complaints of violations of requirements by nursing facilities and to take enforcement actions to correct those violations. §§ 1396r(g)(4), (h)(1), see also 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(j) (2021) (obligating States to provide a grievance process that includes a written decision in response to complaints that provides a full summary of findings, conclusions, and reasoning).",Alito,0,
2022-017,209,"This grievance process dovetails neatly with FNHRA's centralized enforcement regime because it funnels private complaints to the same state authorities that the Act tasks with enforcement. Indeed, respondent in this case wielded FNHRA's grievance process to obtain relief for both of the rights petitioners allegedly violated. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a-80a. But because FNHRA's remedies are more limited than the direct judicial highway that § 1983 offers, it is hard to see why anyone would use them in the future. See Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 122-123, 125 S.Ct. 1453.",Alito,0,
2022-017,210,"The only textual evidence the majority can identify in response to this tailored remedial framework is FNHRA's saving clause, which states that the Act's remedies are in addition to those otherwise available under State or Federal law. § 1396r(h)(8). But this provision only begs the question whether relief under § 1983 is otherwise available. We have recognized as much when holding that a materially identical saving clause did not authorize implied remedies under a separate remedial provision. See AMG Capital Management, LLC v. FTC, 593 U. S. ___, ___-___, 141 S.Ct. 1341, 1350-51, 209 L.Ed.2d 361 (2021). And in the § 1983 context, we have similarly held that saving clauses do not `refer to a suit for redress  of a violation of the statute at issue.' Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 126-127, 125 S.Ct. 1453 (alterations omitted), accord, Sea Clammers, 453 U.S., at 20-21, n. 31, 101 S.Ct. 2615.",Alito,0,
2022-017,211,"These results are understandable. There is a considerable difference between preserving existing remedies for conduct that happens to violate other laws and providing a one-stop remedy for the precise provisions in a statute. See Alexander, 532 U.S., at 289-290, 121 S.Ct. 1511. The latter interpretation runs against a century of holdings that a statute `cannot be held to destroy itself' through a saving clause. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U.S. 214, 227-228, 118 S.Ct, 1956, 141 L.Ed.2d 222 (1998) (quoting Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 446, 27 S.Ct. 350, 51 L.Ed. 553 (1907)). Conversely, concluding that FNHRA may be enforced only through the statute's express remedies gives full effect to § 1396r(h)(8) because the claims available under § 1983 prior to the enactment of the Act continue to be available. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S., at 126, 125 S.Ct. 1453.",Alito,0,
2022-017,212,"In short, allowing a plaintiff to circumvent FNHRA's administrative remedies would be inconsistent with Congress' carefully tailored scheme. Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1012, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). I would thus hold that the Act precludes enforcement under § 1983 and reverse the judgment below. I therefore respectfully dissent.",Alito,0,
2022-018,52,"This case is about children who are among the most vulnerable: those in the child welfare system. In the usual course, state courts apply state law when placing children in foster or adoptive homes. But when the child is an Indian, a federal statute—the Indian Child Welfare Act—governs. Among other things, this law requires a state court to place an Indian child with an Indian caretaker, if one is available. That is so even if the child is already living with a non-Indian family and the state court thinks it in the child's best interest to stay there.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,53,"Before us, a birth mother, foster and adoptive parents, and the State of Texas challenge the Act on multiple constitutional  grounds. They argue that it exceeds federal authority, infringes state sovereignty, and discriminates on the basis of race. The United States, joined by several Indian Tribes, defends the law. The issues are complicated—so for the details, read on. But the bottom line is that we reject all of petitioners' challenges to the statute, some on the merits and others for lack of standing.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,56,"In 1978, Congress enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) out of concern that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies. 92 Stat. 3069, 25 U.S.C. § 1901(4). Congress found that many of these children were being placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions, and that the States had contributed to the problem by failing to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families. §§ 1901(4), (5). This harmed not only Indian parents and children, but also Indian tribes. As Congress put it, there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children. § 1901(3). Testifying before Congress, the Tribal Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians was blunter: Culturally, the chances of Indian survival are significantly reduced if our children, the only real means for the transmission of the tribal heritage, are to be raised in non-Indian homes and denied exposure to the ways of their People. Hearings on S. 1214 before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs and Public Lands of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 193 (1978).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,57,"The Act thus aims to keep Indian children connected to Indian families. Indian child is defined broadly to include not only a child who is a member of an Indian tribe, but also one who is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe. § 1903(4). If the Indian child lives on a reservation, ICWA grants the tribal court exclusive jurisdiction over all child custody proceedings, including adoptions and foster care proceedings. § 1911(a). For other Indian children, state and tribal courts exercise concurrent jurisdiction, although the state court is sometimes required to transfer the case to tribal court. § 1911(b). When a state court adjudicates the proceeding, ICWA governs from start to finish. That is true regardless of whether the proceeding is involuntary (one to which the parents do not consent) or voluntary (one to which they do).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,58,"Involuntary proceedings are subject to especially stringent safeguards. See 25 C.F.R. § 23.104 (2022), 81 Fed. Reg. 38832-38836 (2016). Any party who initiates an involuntary proceeding in state court to place an Indian child in foster care or terminate parental rights must notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's tribe. § 1912(a). The parent or custodian and tribe have the right to intervene in the proceedings, the right to request extra time to prepare for the proceedings, the right to examine all reports or other documents filed with the court, and, for indigent parents or custodians, the right to court-appointed counsel. §§ 1912(a), (b), (c). The party attempting to terminate parental rights or remove an Indian child from an unsafe environment must first satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed  to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. § 1912(d). Even then, the court cannot order a foster care placement unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. § 1912(e). To terminate parental rights, the court must make the same finding beyond a reasonable doubt. § 1912(f).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,59,"The Act applies to voluntary proceedings too. Relinquishing a child temporarily (to foster care) or permanently (to adoption) is a grave act, and a state court must ensure that a consenting parent or custodian knows and understands the terms and consequences. § 1913(a). Notably, a biological parent who voluntarily gives up an Indian child cannot necessarily choose the child's foster or adoptive parents. The child's tribe has a right to intervene at any point in a proceeding to place a child in foster care or terminate parental rights, as well as a right to collaterally attack the state court's decree. §§ 1911(c), 1914. As a result, the tribe can sometimes enforce ICWA's placement preferences against the wishes of one or both biological parents, even after the child is living with a new family. See Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 49-52, 109 S.Ct. 1597, 104 L.Ed.2d 29 (1989).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,60,"ICWA's placement preferences, which apply to all custody proceedings involving Indian children, are hierarchical: State courts may only place the child with someone in a lower-ranked group when there is no available placement in a higher-ranked group. For adoption, a preference shall be given to placements with (1) a member of the child's extended family, (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe, or (3) other Indian families. § 1915(a). For foster care, a preference is given to (1) the Indian child's extended family, (2) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe, (3) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority, and then (4) another institution approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs. § 1915(b). For purposes of the placement preferences, an Indian is any person who is a member of an Indian tribe, and an Indian organization is any group  owned or controlled by Indians. §§ 1903(3), (7). Together, these definitions mean that Indians from any tribe (not just the tribe to which the child has a tie) outrank unrelated non-Indians for both adoption and foster care. And for foster care, institutions run or approved by any tribe outrank placements with unrelated non-Indian families. Courts must adhere to the placement preferences absent good cause to depart from them. §§ 1915(a), (b).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,61,"The child's tribe may pass a resolution altering the prioritization order. § 1915(c). If it does, the agency or court effecting the placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child. Ibid. So long as the least restrictive setting condition is met, the preferences of the Indian child or her parent cannot trump those set by statute or tribal resolution. But, where appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be considered in making a placement. Ibid.",Barrett,0,

M. as a member and informed the state court that it had located a potential alternative placement with non-relative tribal members living in New Mexico.

The Fifth Circuit held that § 1912(d)'s active efforts requirement, § 1912(e)'s and § 1912(f)'s expert witness requirements, and § 1915(e)'s recordkeeping requirement unconstitutionally commandeer the States. Ibid. It divided evenly with respect to the other provisions that petitioners challenge here: § 1912(a)'s notice requirement, § 1915(a) and § 1915(b)'s placement preferences, and § 1951(a)'s recordkeeping requirement. Ibid. So the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's holding that these requirements, too, violate the Tenth Amendment.",Barrett,0,

2022-018,85,"We begin with petitioners' claim that ICWA exceeds Congress's power under Article I. In a long line of cases, we have characterized Congress's power to legislate with respect to the Indian tribes as `plenary and exclusive.' United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004), South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. 329, 343, 118 S.Ct. 789, 139 L.Ed.2d 773 (1998) (Congress possesses plenary power over Indian affairs), Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 470, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979) (Congress exercises plenary and exclusive power over Indian affairs), Winton v. Amos, 255 U.S. 373, 391, 41 S.Ct. 342, 65 L.Ed. 684 (1921) (It is thoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the Indians and all their tribal relations), Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 565, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903) (Congress possesses a paramount power over the property of the Indians), Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445, 478, 19 S.Ct. 722, 43 L.Ed. 1041 (1899) (Congress possesses plenary power of legislation in regard to the Indian tribes). Our cases leave little doubt that Congress's power in this field is muscular, superseding both tribal and state authority. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978) (Congress has plenary authority to limit, modify or eliminate the powers of local self-government which the tribes otherwise possess), Dick v. United States, 208 U.S. 340, 353, 28 S.Ct. 399, 52 L.Ed. 520 (1908) (Congress has power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, and such power is superior and paramount to the authority of any State within whose limits are Indian tribes).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,86,"To be clear, however, plenary does not mean free-floating. A power unmoored from the Constitution would lack both justification and limits. So like the rest of its legislative powers, Congress's authority to regulate Indians must derive from the Constitution, not the atmosphere. Our precedent traces that power to multiple sources.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,87,"The Indian Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate Commerce with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. We have interpreted the Indian  Commerce Clause to reach not only trade, but certain Indian affairs too. Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 192, 109 S.Ct. 1698, 104 L.Ed.2d 209 (1989). Notably, we have declined to treat the Indian Commerce Clause as interchangeable with the Interstate Commerce Clause. Ibid. While under the Interstate Commerce Clause, States retain some authority over trade, we have explained that virtually all authority over Indian commerce and Indian tribes lies with the Federal Government. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 62, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,88,"The Treaty Clause—which provides that the President shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties—provides a second source of power over Indian affairs. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. Until the late 19th century, relations between the Federal Government and the Indian tribes were governed largely by treaties. Lara, 541 U.S., at 201, 124 S.Ct. 1628. Of course, the treaty power does not literally authorize Congress to act legislatively, since it is housed in Article II rather than Article I. Ibid. Nevertheless, we have asserted that treaties made pursuant to that power can authorize Congress to deal with `matters' with which otherwise `Congress could not deal.' Ibid. And even though the United States formally ended the practice of entering into new treaties with the Indian tribes in 1871, this decision did not limit Congress's power to legislate on problems of Indians pursuant to pre-existing treaties. Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S. 194, 203, 95 S.Ct. 944, 43 L.Ed.2d 129 (1975) (emphasis deleted).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,89,"We have also noted that principles inherent in the Constitution's structure empower Congress to act in the field of Indian affairs. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551-552, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (The plenary power of Congress to deal with the special problems of Indians is drawn both explicitly and implicitly from the Constitution itself). At the founding, `Indian affairs were more an aspect of military and foreign policy than a subject of domestic or municipal law.' Lara, 541 U.S. at 201, 124 S.Ct. 1628. With this in mind, we have posited that Congress's legislative authority might rest in part on the Constitution's adoption of preconstitutional powers necessarily inherent in any Federal Government, namely, powers that this Court has described as `necessary concomitants of nationality.' Ibid. (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 315-322, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936)).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,90,"Finally, the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people informs the exercise of legislative power. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 225-226, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983). As we have explained, the Federal Government has `charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust' toward Indian tribes. United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 176, 131 S.Ct. 2313, 180 L.Ed.2d 187 (2011), Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 296, 62 S.Ct. 1049, 86 L.Ed. 1480 (1942) (This Court has recognized the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in its dealings with these dependent and sometimes exploited people). The contours of this special relationship are undefined. Mancari, 417 U.S. at 552, 94 S.Ct. 2474.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,91,"In sum, Congress's power to legislate with respect to Indians is well established and broad. Consistent with that breadth, we have not doubted Congress's ability to legislate across a wide range of areas, including criminal law, domestic violence,  employment, property, tax, and trade. See, e.g., Lara, 541 U.S. at 210, 124 S.Ct. 1628 (law allowing tribes to prosecute nonmember Indians who committed crimes on tribal land), United States v. Bryant, 579 U.S. 140, 142-143, 136 S.Ct. 1954, 195 L.Ed.2d 317 (2016) (law criminalizing domestic violence in Indian country), Mancari, 417 U.S. at 537, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (policy granting Indians employment preferences), United States v. Antelope, 430 U.S. 641, 648, 97 S.Ct. 1395, 51 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977) (law establishing a criminal code for Indian country), Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. at 343, 118 S.Ct. 789 (law altering the boundaries of a reservation), Sunderland v. United States, 266 U.S. 226, 231-232, 45 S.Ct. 64, 69 L.Ed. 259 (1924) (agency action removing the restrictions on alienation of a homestead allotted to an Indian), Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 691, n. 18, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965) (law granting tribe immunity from state taxation), United States v. Algoma Lumber Co., 305 U.S. 415, 417, 421, 59 S.Ct. 267, 83 L.Ed. 260 (1939) (law regulating the sale of timber by an Indian tribe). Indeed, we have only rarely concluded that a challenged statute exceeded Congress's power to regulate Indian affairs. See, e.g., Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72-73, 116 S.Ct. 1114.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,92,"Admittedly, our precedent is unwieldy, because it rarely ties a challenged statute to a specific source of constitutional authority. That makes it difficult to categorize cases and even harder to discern the limits on Congress's power. Still, we have never wavered in our insistence that Congress's Indian affairs power `is not absolute.' Delaware Tribal Business Comm. v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73, 84, 97 S.Ct. 911, 51 L.Ed.2d 173 (1977), United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U.S. 40, 54, 67 S.Ct. 167, 91 L.Ed. 29 (1946) (The power of Congress over Indian affairs may be of a plenary nature, but it is not absolute), United States v. Creek Nation, 295 U.S. 103, 110, 55 S.Ct. 681, 79 L.Ed. 1331 (1935) (plenary power is subject to limitations inhering in such a guardianship and to pertinent constitutional restrictions). It could not be otherwise—Article I gives Congress a series of enumerated powers, not a series of blank checks. Thus, we reiterate that Congress's authority to legislate with respect to Indians is not unbounded. It is plenary within its sphere, but even a sizeable sphere has borders.3",Barrett,0,
2022-018,94,"Petitioners contend that ICWA exceeds Congress's power. Their principal theory, and the one accepted by both Justice ALITO and the dissenters in the Fifth Circuit, is that ICWA treads on the States' authority over family law. Domestic relations have traditionally been governed by state law, thus, federal power over Indians stops where state power over the family begins. Or so the argument goes.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,95,"It is true that Congress lacks a general power over domestic relations, In re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-594, 10 S.Ct. 850, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890), and, as a result, responsibility for regulating marriage and child custody remains primarily with the States, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). See also Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 435, 99  S.Ct. 2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979). But the Constitution does not erect a firewall around family law. On the contrary, when Congress validly legislates pursuant to its Article I powers, we have not hesitated to find conflicting state family law preempted, notwithstanding the limited application of federal law in the field of domestic relations generally. Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U.S. 46, 54, 102 S.Ct. 49, 70 L.Ed.2d 39 (1981) (federal law providing life insurance preempted state family-property law), see also Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.S. 483, 491, 133 S.Ct. 1943, 186 L.Ed.2d 43 (2013) (state laws `governing the economic aspects of domestic relations must give way to clearly conflicting federal enactments' (alteration in original)). In fact, we have specifically recognized Congress's power to displace the jurisdiction of state courts in adoption proceedings involving Indian children. Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U.S. 382, 390, 96 S.Ct. 943, 47 L.Ed.2d 106 (1976) (per curiam).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,96,"Petitioners are trying to turn a general observation (that Congress's Article I powers rarely touch state family law) into a constitutional carveout (that family law is wholly exempt from federal regulation). That argument is a nonstarter. As James Madison said to Members of the First Congress, when the Constitution conferred a power on Congress, they might exercise it, although it should interfere with the laws, or even the Constitution of the States. 2 Annals of Cong. 1897 (1791). Family law is no exception.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,98,"Petitioners come at the problem from the opposite direction too: Even if there is no family law carveout to the Indian affairs power, they contend that Congress's authority does not stretch far enough to justify ICWA. Ticking through the various sources of power, petitioners assert that the Constitution does not authorize Congress to regulate custody proceedings for Indian children. Their arguments fail to grapple with our precedent, and because they bear the burden of establishing ICWA's unconstitutionality, we cannot sustain their challenge to the law. See Lujan v. G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 532 U.S. 189, 198, 121 S.Ct. 1446, 149 L.Ed.2d 391 (2001).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,99,"Take the Indian Commerce Clause, which is petitioners' primary focus. According to petitioners, the Clause authorizes Congress to legislate only with respect to Indian tribes as government entities, not Indians as individuals. Brief for Individual Petitioners 47-50. But we held more than a century ago that commerce with the Indian tribes, means commerce with the individuals composing those tribes. United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 416-417, 18 L.Ed. 182 (1866) (law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Indians in Indian country), United States v. Nice, 241 U.S. 591, 600, 36 S.Ct. 696, 60 L.Ed. 1192 (1916) (same). So that argument is a dead end.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,100,"Petitioners also assert that ICWA takes the commerce out of the Indian Commerce Clause. Their consistent refrain is that children are not commodities that can be traded. Brief for Individual Petitioners 16, Brief for Petitioner Texas 23 (Children are not commodities), id., at 18 (Children are not articles of commerce). Rhetorically, it is a powerful point—of course children are not commercial products. Legally, though, it is beside the point. As we already explained, our precedent states that Congress's power under the Indian Commerce Clause encompasses not only trade but also Indian affairs. Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S. at 192, 109 S.Ct. 1698. Even the judges who otherwise agreed with petitioners below  rejected this narrow view of the Indian Commerce Clause as inconsistent with both our cases and longstanding patterns of federal legislation. 994 F.3d at 374-375 (principal opinion of Duncan, J.). Rather than dealing with this precedent, however, petitioners virtually ignore it.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,101,"Next, petitioners argue that ICWA cannot be authorized by principles inherent in the Constitution's structure because those principles extend, at most, to matters of war and peace. Brief for Petitioner Texas 28. But that is not what our cases say. We have referred generally to the powers necessarily inherent in any Federal Government, and we have offered examples like creating departments of Indian affairs, appointing Indian commissioners, and  `securing and preserving the friendship of the Indian Nations'—none of which are military actions. Lara, 541 U.S. at 201-202, 124 S.Ct. 1628. Once again, petitioners make no argument that takes our cases on their own terms.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,102,"Finally, petitioners observe that ICWA does not implement a federal treaty. Brief for Petitioner Texas 24-27, Brief for Individual Petitioners 56-58. This does not get them very far either, since Congress did not purport to enact ICWA pursuant to the Treaty Clause power and the Fifth Circuit did not uphold ICWA on that rationale.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,103,"Presumably recognizing these obstacles, petitioners turn to criticizing our precedent as inconsistent with the Constitution's original meaning. Yet here too, they offer no account of how their argument fits within the landscape of our case law. For instance, they neither ask us to overrule the precedent they criticize nor try to reconcile their approach with it. They are also silent about the potential consequences of their position. Would it undermine established cases and statutes? If so, which ones? Petitioners do not say.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,104,"We recognize that our case law puts petitioners in a difficult spot. We have often sustained Indian legislation without specifying the source of Congress's power, and we have insisted that Congress's power has limits without saying what they are. Yet petitioners' strategy for dealing with the confusion is not to offer a theory for rationalizing this body of law—that would at least give us something to work with.4 Instead, they frame their arguments as if the slate were clean. More than two centuries in, it is anything but.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,105,"If there are arguments that ICWA exceeds Congress's authority as our precedent stands today, petitioners do not make them. We therefore decline to disturb the Fifth Circuit's conclusion that ICWA is consistent with Article I.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,107,"We now turn to petitioners' host of anticommandeering arguments, which we will break into three categories. First, petitioners challenge certain requirements that apply in involuntary proceedings to place a child in foster care or terminate parental rights: the requirements that an initiating party demonstrate active efforts to keep  the Indian family together, serve notice of the proceeding on the parent or Indian custodian and tribe, and demonstrate, by a heightened burden of proof and expert testimony, that the child is likely to suffer serious emotional or physical damage if the parent or Indian custodian retains custody. Second, petitioners challenge ICWA's placement preferences. They claim that Congress can neither force state agencies to find preferred placements for Indian children nor require state courts to apply federal standards when making custody determinations. Third, they insist that Congress cannot force state courts to maintain or transmit to the Federal Government records of custody proceedings involving Indian children.5",Barrett,0,
2022-018,109,"As a reminder, involuntary proceedings are those to which a parent does not consent. § 1912, 25 C.F.R. § 23.2. Heightened protections for parents and tribes apply in this context, and while petitioners challenge most of them, the active efforts provision is their primary target. That provision requires any party seeking to effect an involuntary foster care placement or termination of parental rights to satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. § 1912(d). According to petitioners, this subsection directs state and local agencies to provide extensive services to the parents of Indian children. It is well established that the Tenth Amendment bars Congress from commanding the States' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997). The active efforts provision, petitioners say, does just that.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,110,"Petitioners' argument has a fundamental flaw: To succeed, they must show that § 1912(d) harnesses a State's legislative or executive authority. But the provision applies to any party who initiates an involuntary proceeding, thus sweeping in private individuals and agencies as well as government entities. A demand that either public or private actors can satisfy is unlikely to require the use of sovereign power. Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U. S. ___, ___-___, 138 S.Ct. 1461, 1478-1479, 200 L.Ed.2d 854 (2018).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,111,"Notwithstanding the term any party, petitioners insist that § 1912(d) is best read as a command to the States. See id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1479 (whether a federal law directly regulates the States depends on how it is best read). They contend that, as a practical matter, States—not private parties—initiate the vast majority of involuntary proceedings. Despite the breadth of the language, the argument goes, States are obviously the parties to whom the statute refers.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,112,"The record contains no evidence supporting the assertion that States institute the vast majority of involuntary proceedings. Examples of private suits are not hard to find, so we are skeptical that their number is negligible. See, e.g., Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 570 U.S. 637, 644-646, 133 S.Ct. 2552, 186 L.Ed.2d 729 (2013) (prospective adoptive parents), In re Guardianship of Eliza W., 304 Neb. 995, 997, 938 N.W.2d 307, 310 (2020) (grandmother),  In re Guardianship of J. C. D., 2004 S.D. 96, ¶ 4, 686 N.W.2d 647, 648 (2004) (grandparents), In re Adoption of T. A.W., 186 Wash.2d 828, 835-837, 850-851, 383 P.3d 492, 494-495, 501-502 (2016) (en banc) (mother and stepfather), J. W. v. R. J., 951 P.2d 1206, 1212-1213 (Alaska 1998) (same). Indeed, Texas's own family code permits certain private parties to initiate suits for the termination of parental rights. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 102.003(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2022), see Reply Brief for Texas 27. And while petitioners treat active efforts as synonymous with government programs, state courts have applied the active efforts requirement in private suits too. See, e.g., In re Adoption of T. A. W., 186 Wash.2d at 851-852, 383 P.3d at 502-503, S. S. v. Stephanie H., 241 Ariz. 419, 424, 388 P.3d 569, 574 (App. 2017), In re N. B., 199 P.3d 16, 23-24 (Colo. App. 2007). That is consistent with ICWA's findings, which describe the role that both public and private actors played in the unjust separation of Indian children from their families and tribes. § 1901. Given all this, it is implausible that § 1912(d) is directed primarily, much less exclusively, at the States.6",Barrett,0,
2022-018,113,"Legislation that applies evenhandedly to state and private actors does not typically implicate the Tenth Amendment. Murphy, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1478. In South Carolina v. Baker, for example, we held that a generally applicable law regulating unregistered bonds did not commandeer the States, rather, it required States wishing to engage in certain activity to take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity. 485 U.S. 505, 514-515, 108 S.Ct. 1355, 99 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988). We reached a similar conclusion in Reno v. Condon, which dealt with a statute prohibiting state motor vehicle departments (DMVs) from selling a driver's personal information without the driver's consent. 528 U.S. 141, 143-144, 120 S.Ct. 666, 145 L.Ed.2d 587 (2000). The law regulated not only the state DMVs, but also private parties who had already purchased this information and sought to resell it. Id., at 146, 120 S.Ct. 666. Applying Baker, we concluded that the Act did not require the States in their sovereign capacity to regulate their own citizens, enact any laws or regulations, or assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals. 528 U.S. at 150-151, 120 S.Ct. 666. Instead, it permissibly regulated the States as the owners of data bases. Id., at 151, 120 S.Ct. 666.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,114,"Petitioners argue that Baker and Condon are distinguishable because they addressed laws regulating a State's commercial activity, while ICWA regulates a State's core sovereign function of protecting the health and safety of children within its borders. Brief for Petitioner Texas 66. A State can stop selling bonds or a driver's personal information, petitioners say, but it cannot withdraw from the area of child  welfare—protecting children is the business of government, even if it is work in which private parties share. Nor, of course, could Texas avoid ICWA by excluding only Indian children from social services. Because States cannot exit the field, they are hostage to ICWA, which requires them to implement Congress's regulatory program for the care of Indian children and families. Id., at 64-65, Reply Brief for Texas 27.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,115,"This argument is presumably directed at situations in which only the State can rescue a child from neglectful parents. But § 1912 applies to more than child neglect —for instance, it applies when a biological mother arranges for a private adoption without the biological father's consent. See, e.g., Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 643-644, 133 S.Ct. 2552. And even when a child is trapped in an abusive home, the State is not necessarily the only option for rescue—for instance, a grandmother can seek guardianship of a grandchild whose parents are failing to care for her. See, e.g., In re Guardianship of Eliza W., 304 Neb. at 996-997, 938 N.W.2d at 309-310. Petitioners do not distinguish between these varied situations, much less isolate a domain in which only the State can act. Some amici assert that, at the very least, removing children from imminent danger in the home falls exclusively to the government. Brief for Academy of Adoption and Assisted Reproduction Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 14 (Amici are aware of no state in which a private actor may lawfully remove a child from his existing home). Maybe so—but that does not help petitioners' commandeering argument, because the active efforts requirement does not apply to emergency removals. § 1922. If ICWA commandeers state performance of a core sovereign function, petitioners do not give us the details.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,116,"When a federal statute applies on its face to both private and state actors, a commandeering argument is a heavy lift— and petitioners have not pulled it off. Both state and private actors initiate involuntary proceedings. And, if there is a core of involuntary proceedings committed exclusively to the sovereign, Texas neither identifies its contours nor explains what § 1912(d) requires of a State in that context. Petitioners have therefore failed to show that the active efforts requirement commands the States to deploy their executive or legislative power to implement federal Indian policy.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,117,"As for petitioners' challenges to other provisions of § 1912—the notice requirement, expert witness requirement, and evidentiary standards—we doubt that requirements placed on a State as litigant implicate the Tenth Amendment. But in any event, these provisions, like § 1912(d), apply to both private and state actors, so they too pose no anticommandeering problem.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,119,"Petitioners also raise a Tenth Amendment challenge to § 1915, which dictates placement preferences for Indian children. According to petitioners, this provision orders state agencies to perform a diligent search for placements that satisfy ICWA's hierarchy. Brief for Petitioner Texas 63, Reply Brief for Texas 24, see also Brief for Individual Petitioners 67-68. Petitioners assert that the Department of the Interior understands § 1915 this way, 25 C.F.R. § 23.132(c)(5), and the Tribes who intervene in proceedings governed by ICWA share that understanding—for example, the Librettis' adoption of Baby O was delayed because the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Tribe demanded that county officials exhaustively search for a placement with the Tribe first. Reply Brief for Texas  24-25. Just as Congress cannot compel state officials to search databases to determine the lawfulness of gun sales, Printz, 521 U.S. at 902-904, 117 S.Ct. 2365, petitioners argue, Congress cannot compel state officials to search for a federally preferred placement.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,120,"As an initial matter, this argument encounters the same problem that plagues petitioners with respect to § 1912: Petitioners have not shown that the diligent search requirement, which applies to both private and public parties, demands the use of state sovereign authority. But this argument fails for another reason too: Section 1915 does not require anyone, much less the States, to search for alternative placements. As the United States emphasizes, petitioners' interpretation cannot be squared with this Court's decision in Adoptive Couple, which held that `there simply is no preference to apply if no alternative party that is eligible to be preferred has come forward.' Brief for Federal Parties 44 (quoting 570 U.S. at 654, 133 S.Ct. 2552), Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 654, 133 S.Ct. 2552 (§ 1915(a)'s preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child). Instead, the burden is on the tribe or other objecting party to produce a higher-ranked placement. Ibid. So, as it stands, petitioners assert an anticommandeering challenge to a provision that does not command state agencies to do anything.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,121,"State courts are a different matter. ICWA indisputably requires them to apply the placement preferences in making custody determinations. §§ 1915(a), (b). Petitioners argue that this too violates the anticommandeering doctrine. To be sure, they recognize that Congress can require state courts, unlike state executives and legislatures, to enforce federal law. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 178-179, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (Federal statutes enforceable in state courts do, in a sense, direct state judges to enforce them, but this sort of federal `direction' of state judges is mandated by the text of the Supremacy Clause). But they draw a distinction between requiring state courts to entertain federal causes of action and requiring them to apply federal law to state causes of action. They claim that if state law provides the cause of action—as Texas law does here—then the State gets to call the shots, unhindered by any federal instruction to the contrary. Brief for Individual Petitioners 62-63, 66-67.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,122,"This argument runs headlong into the Constitution. The Supremacy Clause provides that the Laws of the United States  shall be the supreme Law of the Land, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding. Art. VI, cl. 2. Thus, when Congress enacts a valid statute pursuant to its Article I powers, state law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372, 120 S.Ct. 2288, 147 L.Ed.2d 352 (2000). End of story. That a federal law modifies a state law cause of action does not limit its preemptive effect. See, e.g., Hillman, 569 U.S. at 493-494, 133 S.Ct. 1943 (federal law establishing an `order of precedence' for beneficiaries of life insurance preempted state law), Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.S. 141, 151-152, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001) (Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempted state law regarding the economic consequences of divorce), Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U.S. 655, 660-661, 70 S.Ct. 398, 94 L.Ed. 424 (1950) (federal military benefits law preempted state community-property rules).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,124,"Finally, we turn to ICWA's recordkeeping provisions. Section 1951(a) requires courts to provide the Secretary of the Interior with a copy of the final order in the adoptive placement of any Indian child. The court must also provide other information as may be necessary to show the child's name and tribal affiliation, the names and addresses of the biological parents and adoptive parents, and the identity of any agency with information about the adoptive placement. Section 1915(e) requires the State to maintain a record evidencing the efforts to comply with the order of preference specified by ICWA. The record shall be made available at any time upon the request of the Secretary or the Indian child's tribe. Petitioners argue that Congress cannot conscript the States into federal service by assigning them recordkeeping tasks.7",Barrett,0,
2022-018,125,"The anticommandeering doctrine applies distinctively to a state court's adjudicative responsibilities. Printz, 521 U.S. at 907, 117 S.Ct. 2365. As we just explained, this distinction is evident in the Supremacy Clause, which refers specifically to state judges. Art. VI, cl. 2. From the beginning, the text manifested in practice: As originally understood, the Constitution allowed Congress to require state judges to enforce federal prescriptions, insofar as those prescriptions related to matters appropriate for the judicial power. Printz, 521 U.S. at 907, 117 S.Ct. 2365 (emphasis deleted). In Printz, we indicated that this principle may extend to tasks that are ancillary to a quintessentially adjudicative task—such as recording, registering, and certifying documents. Id., at 908, n. 2. 117 S.Ct. 2365.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,126,"Petitioners reject Printz's observation, insisting that there is a distinction between rules of decision (which state courts must follow) and recordkeeping requirements (which they can ignore). But Printz described numerous historical examples of Congress imposing recordkeeping and reporting requirements on state courts. The early Congresses passed laws directing state courts to perform certain tasks fairly described as ancillary to the courts' adjudicative duties. For example, state courts were required to process and record applications for United States citizenship. Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch. 3, § 1, 1 Stat. 103-104. The clerk (or other court official) was required to certify and transmit the application to the Secretary of State, along with information about the name, age, nation, residence and occupation, for the time being, of the alien. Act of June 18, 1798, § 2, 1 Stat. 567. The clerk also had to register aliens seeking naturalization and issue certificates confirming the court's receipt of the alien's request for registration. Act of Apr. 14, 1802, § 2, 2 Stat. 155.8  Federal law imposed other duties on state courts unrelated to immigration and naturalization. The Judiciary Act of 1789, which authorized any justice of the peace, or other magistrate of any of the United States to arrest and imprison federal offenders, required the judge to set bail at the defendant's request. § 33, 1 Stat. 91. Congress also required state courts to administer oaths to prisoners, to issue certificates authorizing the apprehension of fugitives, and to collect proof of the claims of Canadian refugees who had aided the United States in the Revolutionary War. Act of May 5, 1792, ch. 29, § 2, 1 Stat. 266 (any person imprisoned  may have the oath or affirmation herein after expressed administered to him by any judge of the United States, or of the general or supreme court of law of the state in which the debtor is imprisoned), Act of Feb. 12, 1793, ch. 7, § 1, 1 Stat. 302 (governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory shall certify as authentic an indictment or affidavit charging a fugitive from justice), Act of Apr. 7, 1798, § 3, 1 Stat. 548 (proof of the several circumstances necessary to entitle the applicants to the benefits of this act, may be taken before  a judge of the supreme or superior court, or the first justice or first judge of the court of common pleas or country court of any state).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,127,"There is more. Shortly after ratification, Congress passed a detailed statute that required state-court judges to gather and certify reports. Act of July 20, 1790, § 3, 1 Stat. 132. The Act authorized commanders of ships to request examinations of their vessels from any justice of the peace of the city, town or place. Ibid. The judge would order three qualified people to prepare a report on the vessel's condition, which the judge would review and endorse. Ibid. Then, the judge was required to issue an order regarding whether the said ship or vessel is fit to proceed on the intended voyage, and if not, whether such repairs can be made or deficiencies supplied where the ship or vessel then lays. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,128,"These early congressional enactments provide `contemporaneous and weighty evidence' of the Constitution's meaning. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 723, 106 S.Ct. 3181, 92 L.Ed.2d 583 (1986). Collectively, they demonstrate that the Constitution does not prohibit the Federal Government from imposing adjudicative tasks on state courts. This makes sense against the backdrop of the Madisonian Compromise: Since Article III established only the Supreme Court and made inferior federal courts optional, Congress could have relied almost entirely on state courts to apply federal law. Printz, 521 U.S. at 907, 117 S.Ct. 2365. Had Congress taken that course, it would have had to rely on state courts to perform adjudication-adjacent tasks too.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,129,"We now confirm what we suggested in Printz: Congress may impose ancillary recordkeeping requirements related to state-court proceedings without violating the Tenth Amendment. Such requirements do not offload the Federal Government's responsibilities onto the States, nor do they put state legislatures and executives under the direct control of Congress. Murphy, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1478. Rather, they are a logical consequence of our system of dual sovereignty in which state courts are required to apply federal law. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 457, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991).",Barrett,0,
2022-018,130,"Here, ICWA's recordkeeping requirements are comparable in kind and in degree to the historical examples. Like the naturalization laws, § 1951(a) requires the state court to transmit to the Secretary a copy of a court order along with basic demographic information. Section 1915(e) likewise requires the State to record a limited amount of information—the efforts made to comply with the placement preferences —and provide the information to the Secretary and to the child's tribe. These duties are ancillary to the state court's obligation to conduct child custody proceedings in compliance with ICWA. Printz, 521 U.S. at 908, n. 2, 117 S.Ct. 2365. Thus, ICWA's recordkeeping requirements are consistent with the Tenth Amendment.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,132,"Petitioners raise two additional claims: an equal protection challenge to ICWA's placement preferences and a non-delegation challenge to the provision allowing tribes to alter the placement preferences. We do not reach the merits of these claims because no party before the Court has standing to raise them. Article III requires a plaintiff to show that she has suffered an injury in fact that is `fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.' California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2113, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021). Neither the individual petitioners nor Texas can pass that test.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,134,"The individual petitioners argue that ICWA injures them by placing them on unequal footing with Indian parents who seek to adopt or foster an Indian child. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993). Under ICWA's hierarchy of preferences, non-Indian parents are generally last in line for potential placements. According to petitioners, this erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group. Ibid., see also Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 362, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567 (1970) (the Equal Protection Clause secures the right of individuals to be considered for government positions and benefits without the burden of invidiously discriminatory disqualifications). The racial discrimination they allege counts as an Article III injury.9",Barrett,0,
2022-018,135,"But the individual petitioners have not shown that this injury is likely to be redressed by judicial relief. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. ___, ___, 141  S.Ct. 2190, 2203, 210 L.Ed.2d 568 (2021). They seek an injunction preventing the federal parties from enforcing ICWA and a declaratory judgment that the challenged provisions are unconstitutional. Yet enjoining the federal parties would not remedy the alleged injury, because state courts apply the placement preferences, and state agencies carry out the court-ordered placements. §§ 1903(1), 1915(a), (b), see also Brief for Individual Petitioners 63 (There is no federal official who administers ICWA or carries out its mandates). The state officials who implement ICWA are not parties to the suit, and there is no reason they should be obliged to honor an incidental legal determination the suit produced. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 569, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (plurality opinion). So an injunction would not give petitioners legally enforceable protection from the allegedly imminent harm.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,136,"Petitioners' request for a declaratory judgment suffers from the same flaw. See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671-672, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950). This form of relief conclusively resolves `the legal rights of the parties.' Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200, 134 S.Ct. 843, 187 L.Ed.2d 703 (2014) (emphasis added). But again, state officials are nonparties who would not be bound by the judgment. Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892-893, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008). Thus, the equal protection issue would not be settled between petitioners and the officials who matter— which would leave the declaratory judgment powerless to remedy the alleged harm. 994 F.3d at 448 (Costa, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (What saves proper declaratory judgments from a redressability problem—but is lacking here—is that they have preclusive effect on a traditional lawsuit that is imminent). After all, the point of a declaratory judgment is to establish a binding adjudication that enables the parties to enjoy the benefits of reliance and repose secured by res judicata. 18A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4446 (3d ed. Supp. 2022). Without preclusive effect, a declaratory judgment is little more than an advisory opinion. Ibid., see Public Serv.

2022-018,137,"The individual petitioners do not dispute —or even address—any of this.

2022-018,138,"But redressability requires that the court be able to afford relief through the exercise of its power, not through the persuasive or even awe-inspiring effect of the opinion explaining the exercise of its power.

Otherwise, redressability would be satisfied whenever a decision might persuade actors who are not before  the court—contrary to Article III's strict prohibition on issuing advisory opinions. Carney v. Adams, ___ 592 U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 493, 498, 208 L.Ed.2d 305 (2020). It is a federal court's judgment, not its opinion, that remedies an injury, thus it is the judgment, not the opinion, that demonstrates redressability.

2022-018,141,"Yet Texas advances a few creative arguments for why it has standing despite these settled rules.

Reply Brief for Texas 15, id., at 14 (ICWA forces Texas to violate its own constitutional obligations). This is not the kind of concrete and particularized invasion of a legally protected interest necessary to demonstrate an `injury in fact.' Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Were it otherwise, a State would always have standing to bring constitutional challenges when it is complicit in enforcing federal law. Texas tries to finesse this problem by characterizing ICWA as a fiscal trap, forcing it to discriminate against its citizens or lose federal funds. Brief for Petitioner Texas 39-40. But ICWA is not a Spending Clause statute—Texas bases this argument on a vague reference to a different Spending Clause statute that it does not challenge. And Texas has not established that those funds, which the State has accepted for years, are conditioned on compliance with the placement preferences anyway. See 42 U.S.C. § 622, Brief for Federal Parties 49, n. 6.",Barrett,0,
2022-018,142,"Texas also claims a direct pocketbook injury associated with the costs of keeping records, providing notice in involuntary proceedings, and producing expert testimony before moving a child to foster care or terminating parental rights.

S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2120. The provisions do not rise  or fall together, proving that the placement preferences are unconstitutional would not show that enforcement of any of these other provisions violates the Constitution.

The former, then, cannot justify a challenge to the latter.",Barrett,0,

I am pleased to join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to add some historical context. To appreciate fully the significance of today's decision requires an understanding of the long line of policies that drove Congress to adopt ICWA.

In all its many forms, the dissolution of the Indian family has had devastating effects on children and parents alike.

As one Commissioner of Indian Affairs put it, while the first wild redskin placed in the schools chafes at the loss of freedom and longs to return to his wildwood home, that resistance would fade with each successive generation, leaving a greater desire to be in touch with the dominant race.

2022-018,159,"Adding insult to injury, the United States stuck Tribes with a bill for these programs. At points, as much as 95% of the funding for Indian boarding schools came from Indian trust fund monies raised by selling Indian land. Id., at 44. To subsidize operations further, the boarding schools frequently required children not even 12 years old to work on the grounds. Id., at 62-63. Some rationalized this experience as a benefit to the children. Id., at 59-63. But in candor, Indian boarding schools could not possibly be maintained were it not for the fact that students were required to do  an amount of labor that had in the aggregate a very appreciable monetary value.

R. Trennert, From Carlisle to Phoenix: The Rise and Fall of the Indian Outing System, 1878-1930, 52 Pacific Hist. Rev. 267, 273 (1983). This program took many Indian children even further from their homes, families, and cultures. Fletcher & Singel 943. Advocates of the outing system hoped it would be extended until every Indian child was in a white home. D. Otis, The Dawes Act and the Allotment of Indian Lands 68 (1973). In some respects, outing-system advocates were ahead of their time. The program they devised laid the groundwork for the system of mass adoption that, as we shall see, eventually moved Congress to enact ICWA many decades later.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,161,"In 1928, the Meriam Report, prepared by the Brookings Institution, examined conditions in the Indian boarding schools. It found, frankly and unequivocally, that the provisions for the care of the Indian children  are grossly inadequate. Meriam Report 11. It recommended that the federal government accelerate the move away from the boarding school system in favor of day school or public school facilities. Id., at 35. That transition would be slow to materialize, though. As late as 1971, federal boarding schools continued to house more than 17 per cent of the Indian school-age population. W. Byler, The Destruction of American Indian Families 1 (S. Unger ed. 1977) (AAIA Report).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,163,"The transition away from boarding schools was not the end of efforts to remove Indian children from their families and Tribes, more nearly, it was the end of the beginning. As federal boarding schools closed their doors and Indian children returned to the reservations, States with significant Native American populations found themselves facing significant new educational and welfare responsibilities. Historians Brief 13-18. Around this time, as fate would have it, shifting racial ideologies and changing gender norms had led to an increased demand for Indian children by adoptive couples. M. Jacobs, Remembering the Forgotten Child: The American Indian Child Welfare Crisis of the 1960s and 1970s, 37 Am. Indian Q. 136, 141 (2013). Certain States saw in this shift an opportunity. They could save  money by promoting the adoption of Indian children by private families. Id., at 153.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,164,"This restarted a now-familiar nightmare for Indian families. The same assimilationist rhetoric previously invoked by the federal government persisted, voiced this time by state and county officials. L. George, Why the Need for the Indian Child Welfare Act?, 5 J. of Multicultural Social Work 165, 169 (1997). `If you want to solve the Indian problem you can do it in one generation,' one official put it. Ibid. `You can take all of the children of school age and move them bodily out of the Indian country and transport them to some other part of the United States.' Ibid. This would allow `civilized people' to raise the children, instead of their families or their tribal communities. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,165,"In this respect, the removal of Indian children by States had much in common with Indian boarding schools. Fletcher & Singel 952. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Indian-child removal reached new heights. Surveys conducted in 1969 and 1974 showed that approximately 25-35 per cent of all Indian children were separated from their families. AAIA Report 1. Often,  these removals whisked children not only out of their families but out of their communities. Some estimate that more than 90 per cent of non-related adoptions of Indian children were made by non-Indian couples. Id., at 2.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,166,"These family separations frequently lacked justification. According to one report, only about 1 per cent of the separations studied involved alleged physical abuse. Ibid. The other 99 percent? Vague grounds such as `neglect' or `social deprivation.' Ibid. These determinations, often wholly inappropriate in the context of Indian family life, came mainly from non-Indian social workers, many of whom were ignorant of Indian cultural values and social norms. Id., at 2-3. They routinely penalized Indian parents for conditions of poverty, poor housing, lack of modern plumbing, and overcrowding. Id., at 3. One 3-year-old Sioux child, for instance, was removed from her family on the State's belief that an Indian reservation is an unsuitable environment for a child. Ibid. So it was that some Indian families, forced onto reservations at gunpoint, were later told that they lived in a place unfit for raising their children. Id., at 3-4.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,167,"Aggravating matters, these separations were frequently carried out without due process of law. Id., at 4. Children and their parents rarely had counsel. Ibid. For that matter, few cases saw the inside of a courtroom. Welfare departments knew that they could threaten to withhold benefit payments if Indian parents did not surrender custody. Id., at 4-5. Nor were threats always necessary. After all the Tribes had suffered at the government's hands, many parents simply believed they had no power to resist. Ibid. One interviewed mother wept that she did not dare protest the taking of her children for fear of going to jail. Id., at 7. For those Indian parents who did resist, simple abduction remained an option. Id., at 5. Parents were, for instance, sometimes tricked into signing forms that they believed authorized only a brief removal of their children. Ibid. Only later would they discover that the forms purported to surrender full custody. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,168,"Like the boarding school system that preceded it, this new program of removal had often-disastrous consequences. Because the family is the most fundamental economic, educational, and health-care unit in society, these assaults on Indian families contributed to the precarious conditions that Indian parents and children already faced. Id., at 7-8. Many parents came to feel hopeless, powerless, and unworthy—further feeding the cycle of removal. Id., at 8. For many children, separation from their families caused severe distress that interfered with their physical, mental, and social growth and development. Ibid. It appears, too, that Indian children were significantly more likely to experience physical, sexual, and emotional abuse in foster and adoptive homes than their white counterparts. A. Landers, S.

2022-018,171,"Eventually, Congress could ignore the problem no longer. In 1978, it responded with the Indian Child Welfare Act. 92 Stat. 3096. The statute's findings show that Congress was acutely aware of the scope of the crisis. An alarmingly high percentage of Indian families, Congress observed, were being broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal state public and private agencies. 25 U.S.C. § 1901(4). And an alarmingly high percentage of such children were placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions. Ibid. Removal at that scale threatened the continued existence and integrity of Indian Tribes. § 1901(3).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,172,"The statute Congress settled upon contains various provisions aimed at addressing this crisis. At bottom, though, the law's operation is simple. It installs substantive and procedural guardrails against the unjustified termination of parental rights and removal of Indian children from tribal life.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,173,"The touchstone of the statute is notice. In any involuntary removal proceeding involving an Indian child, the initiating party must inform (1) the parent or custodian, and (2) the child's Tribe. § 1912(a). Either or both can intervene. § 1911(c). ICWA also makes it harder for the moving party to win an involuntary removal proceeding. The party must show that active efforts have been made to avoid removing the Indian child. § 1912(d). It must show the status quo is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. § 1912(e), (f). And it must prove that fact by clear and convincing evidence, § 1912(e) (for placement in foster services), or beyond a reasonable doubt, § 1912(f) (for termination of parental rights).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,174,"Even when it comes to voluntary removal proceedings, ICWA sets certain minimum Federal standards for the placement of Indian children in foster or adoptive homes. § 1902. In any adoptive placement, a court by default must give preference to (1) a member of the child's extended family, (2) other members of the Indian child's Tribe, or (3) other Indian families. § 1915(a). This priority governs unless the initiating party can show good cause. Ibid. A similar regime applies by default to foster-care or preadoptive placements. § 1915(b). But note that by default. ICWA gives Tribes a voice. It allows them to establish a different order of preference by resolution, provided it is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child. § 1915(c).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,175,"Recognizing that coercion remains possible even with these protections, ICWA also allows for postplacement relief. It lets the Indian child, the parent, or the Tribe petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate an order that violated key provisions of ICWA. § 1914. Of special relevance, an Indian parent consenting to adoption has two years to withdraw consent on the grounds that consent was obtained through fraud or duress. § 1913(d).",Gorsuch,0,

2022-018,179,"This history leads us to the question at the heart of today's cases: Did Congress lack the constitutional authority to enact ICWA, as Texas and the private plaintiffs contend? In truth, that is not one question, but many. What authorities do the Tribes possess under our Constitution? What power does Congress have with respect to tribal relations? What does that mean for States? And how do those principles apply in a context like adoption, which involves competing claims of federal, state, and tribal authority?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,180,"Answering these questions requires a full view of the Indian-law bargain struck in our Constitution. Under the terms of that bargain, Indian Tribes remain independent sovereigns with the exclusive power to manage their internal matters. As a corollary of that sovereignty, States have virtually no role to play when it comes to Indian affairs. To preserve this equilibrium between Tribes and States, the Constitution vests in the federal government a set of potent (but limited and enumerated) powers. In particular, the Indian Commerce Clause gives Congress a robust (but not plenary) power to regulate the ways in which non-Indians may interact with Indians. To understand each of those pieces— and how they fit together—is to understand why the Indian Child Welfare Act must survive today's legal challenge.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,181,"This is all much more straightforward than it sounds. Take each piece of the puzzle in turn. Then, with the full constitutional picture assembled, return to ICWA's provisions. By then, you will have all you need to see why the Court upholds the law.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,183,"Start with the question how our Constitution approaches tribal sovereignty. In the years before Jamestown, Indian Tribes existed as self-governing sovereign political communities. United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 322-323, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978). They employed sophisticated governmental models, formed confederacies with one another, and often engaged in decisionmaking by consensual agreement. 1 B. Pritzker, Native Americans: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Peoples xii (1998).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,184,"When the British crossed the Atlantic, they brought with them their own legal understandings. A seasoned colonial power, Britain was no stranger to the idea of tributary and feudatory states. E. de Vattel, Law of Nations 60-61 (1805) (Vattel). And it was a long-held tenet of international law that such entities do not cease to be sovereign and independent even when subject to military conquest— at least not so long as self government and sovereign and independent authority are left in their administration. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832). For that reason, early history furnishes no example, from the first settlement of our country, of any attempt on the part of the Crown to interfere with the internal affairs of the Indians. Id., at 547, see also Vattel 60. Instead, the settled  state of things reflected the British view that Tribes were nations capable of maintaining the relations of peace and war, and of governing themselves. 6 Pet. at 548-549.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,185,"Consistent with that understanding, the British regarded the Indians as owners of their land. S. Banner, How the Indians Lost Their Land: Law and Power on the Frontier 12 (2005). Britain often purchased land from Tribes (at least nominally) and predicated its system of legal title on those purchases. Ibid. The Crown entered into all manner of treaties with the Tribes too—just as it did with fellow European powers. See, e.g., Letter from Gov. Burnet to Lords of Trade, Nov. 21, 1722, concerning the Great Treaty of 1722 Between the Five Nations, the Mahicans, and the Colonies of New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, in 5 Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State of New York 655-681 (E. O'Callaghan ed. 1955), Deed in Trust From Three of the Five Nations of Indians to the King in 1726, in id., at 800-801, A Treaty Held at the Town of Lancaster with the Indians of the Six Nations in 1744, in Indian Treaties, Printed by Benjamin Franklin, 1736-1762, pp. 43-49 (1938).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,186,"Ultimately, the American Revolution replaced that legal framework with a similar one. Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, 597 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2486, 2506, 213 L.Ed.2d 847 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). The newly independent Nation wasted no time entering into treaties of its own—in no small part to secure its continued existence against external threats. See, e.g., Articles of Agreement and Confederation, Sept. 17, 1778, 7 Stat. 13. In practice, too, the new Republic broadly recognized the sovereignty of Indian Tribes, even if it did so sometimes grudgingly. W. Quinn, Federal Acknowledgment of American Indian Tribes: The Historical Development of a Legal Concept, 34 Am. J. L. Hist. 331, 337 (1990). As we will see, the period under the Articles of Confederation was marred by significant conflict, driven by state and individual intrusions on tribal land. But the Constitution that followed reflected an understanding that Tribes enjoy a power to rule themselves that no other governmental body—state or federal—may usurp.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,187,"Several constitutional provisions prove the point. One sure tell is the federal government's treaty power. See Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. Because the United States adopted and sanctioned the previous treaties with the Indian nations, it consequently admitted the Tribes' rank among those powers who are capable of making treaties. Worcester, 6 Pet., at 559. Similarly, the Commerce Clause vests in Congress the power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3—conferrals of authority with respect to three separate sorts of sovereign entities that do not entail the power to eliminate any of them. Even beyond that, the Constitution exempts from the apportionment calculus Indians not taxed. § 2, cl. 3. This formula ratified the legal treatment of tribal Indians even within the States as separate and sovereign peoples, who were simply not part of the state polities. R. Clinton, The Dormant Indian Commerce Clause, 27 Conn. L. Rev. 1055, 1150 (1995) (Clinton 1995). (The Fourteenth Amendment would later reprise this language, Amdt. 14, § 2, confirming both the enduring sovereignty of Tribes and the bedrock principle that Indian status is a political rather than racial classification, Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 553, n. 24, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974).)",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,188,"Given these express provisions, the early conduct of the political branches comes as little surprise. From the beginning, the  Washington Administration acknowledged considerable Native autonomy. G. Ablavsky, Beyond the Indian Commerce Clause, 124 Yale L. J. 1012, 1067 (2015) (Ablavsky 2015). Henry Knox, President Washington's Secretary of War, described the Tribes as akin to foreign nations, not as the subjects of any particular State. Letter to G. Washington (July 7, 1789), in 3 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 134-141 (D. Twohig ed. 1989). Thomas Jefferson spoke of them as maintaining full, undivided, and independent sovereignty as long as they chose to keep it, commenting also that this might be for ever. Notes on Cabinet Opinions (Feb. 26, 1793), in 25 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 271-272 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1992). This view would later feature in a formal opinion of the Attorney General, who explained that, so long as a Tribe exists  its title and possession are sovereign and exclusive, and there exists no authority to enter upon their lands, for any purpose whatever, without their consent. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 465, 466 (1821).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,189,"What went for the Executive went for Congress. In the first few decades of the Nation's existence, the Legislative Branch passed a battery of statutes known as the Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts. See, e.g., Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137, Act of Mar. 1, 1793, ch. 19, 1 Stat. 329, Act of May 19, 1796, ch. 30, 1 Stat. 469, Act of Mar. 30, 1802, ch. 13, 2 Stat. 139, Act of June 30, 1834, 4 Stat. 729. Without exception, those Acts either explicitly or implicitly regulated only the non-Indians who ventured into Indian country to deal with Indians, and did not purport to regulate the Tribes or their members in any way.

2022-018,190,"This Court recognized many of these same points in its early cases. For example, in Worcester, the State of Georgia sought to seize Cherokee lands, abolish the Tribe and its laws, and apply its own criminal laws to tribal lands. 6 Pet. at 525-528. Holding Georgia's laws unconstitutional, this Court acknowledged that Tribes remain independent political communities, retaining their original natural rights. Id., at 559. While necessarily dependent on the United States, id., at 555, under the settled doctrine of the law of nations, the Court held, a weaker power does not surrender its independence—its right to self-government, by associating with a stronger and taking its protection, id., at 560-561. The Cherokee, like other Tribes, remained a distinct community occupying its own territory  in which the laws of the State can have no force, and which the citizens of that State have no right to enter, but with the assent of the Tribe themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of Congress. Id., at 561. Justice McLean, concurring, put it succinctly: All the rights which belong to self-government have been recognized as vested in the Tribes. Id., at 580.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,191,"In the end, President Jackson refused to abide by the Court's decision in Worcester, precipitating the Trail of Tears. He is quoted as saying: `John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.' F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 123 (1942). But just as this Court had no power to enforce its judgment, President Jackson had no power to erase its reasoning. So the rule of Worcester persisted in courts of law, unchanged, for decades. Recognizing the inherent sovereignty of Tribes, this Court held that States could not tax Indian land. See, e.g., The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 751-761, 18 L.Ed. 667 (1867), The New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761, 771-772, 18 L.Ed. 708 (1867). It held that the Fourteenth Amendment  did not apply on Indian land. See Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U.S. 94, 99-109, 5 S.Ct. 41, 28 L.Ed. 643 (1884). And it sharply limited even the power of the federal government to prosecute crimes between Indians on Indian land where the Tribe had stepped in to resolve the dispute. See Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556, 572, 3 S.Ct. 396, 27 L.Ed. 1030 (1883).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,192,"Nor did later developments call this original understanding into doubt. To be sure, in 1871, Congress declared that Tribes (prospectively) are no longer parties with whom the United States may contract by treaty. Act of Mar. 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 566, codified at 25 U.S.C. § 71, but see United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 218, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (describing the Act as constitutionally suspect), M. Pearl, Originalism and the Indians, 93 Tulane L. Rev. 269, 330-331 (2018) (Pearl) (similar). But the sponsors of that Act sought only to increase the role of bicameral legislation in managing Indian affairs. See Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S. 194, 202-203, 95 S.Ct. 944, 43 L.Ed.2d 129 (1975). The law did not purport to invalidate or impair any existing obligation of any treaty lawfully made and ratified. 25 U.S.C. § 71. And the law did not abridge, nor could it have validly abridged, the long-settled view of tribal sovereignty. In fact, the United States proceeded to enter into roughly 400 further executive agreements with the Tribes practically indistinguishable from the treaties that came before. See generally V. Deloria & R. DeMallie, Documents of American Indian Diplomacy: Treaties, Agreements, and Conventions, 1775-1979 (1999). Keep this original understanding of tribal sovereignty in mind. It provides an essential point of framing.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,194,"Just as the Constitution safeguards the sovereign authority of Tribes, it comes with a concomitant jurisdictional limit on the reach of state law over Indian affairs. McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 171, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973). As this Court has consistently recognized, the policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in the Nation's history. Rice v. Olson, 324 U.S. 786, 789, 65 S.Ct. 989, 89 L.Ed. 1367 (1945). Instead, responsibility for managing interactions with the Tribes rests exclusively with the federal government. To appreciate this point, walk through time once more.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,195,"Since the first days of British rule, the Crown oversaw—and retained the power to dictate—the Colonies' engagement with the Indian Tribes. See Clinton 1995, at 1064-1098. In response to a pattern of conflict arising out of colonial intrusion on tribal land, that supervision grew increasingly exacting. Ibid., see also R.

In 1743, for example, a British royal commission rejected an effort by the colony of Connecticut to exercise independent jurisdiction over a Tribe within its borders. Id., at 335-336. The decision rested on a now-familiar logic: The Indians, though living amongst the king's subjects in these countries, are a separate and distinct people from them, they are treated with as such, they have a polity of their own, they make peace and war with any nation of Indians when they think fit, without controul from the English.

That proclamation announced the Crown's intent to manage all land cessions, diplomatic and other relations, and trade with the Indian Tribes, and to displace contrary colonial practice. Id., at 357.

2022-018,197,"After the Revolution, the Articles of Confederation gave the newly formed United States  the sole and exclusive right and power of  managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the States. Art. IX (1777). In providing that grant of authority, the Articles' drafters may have meant to codify the centralized approach the British had pursued. But the byzantine document the drafters created, Ablavsky 2015, at 1034, came with a pair of easily exploited loopholes. First, the language of its Indian affairs clause allowed some to claim that various Tribes were `members' of the States and thus exclusively or principally subject to state legislative control. Clinton 1995, at 1103, 1150. Second, owing to a fear that the phrase sole and exclusive could give the misimpression that States lacked power to manage their own affairs, the Articles' drafters added another clause stipulating that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violated. Art IX. Taken literally, that provision meant only that the Articles left to States what belonged to the States and to the Tribes what belonged to the Tribes. But some States saw in that language too an opportunity to assert their own control. See Clinton 1995, at 1103, 1107, 1113-1118, 1128-1131.",Gorsuch,0,

By the time the Constitutional Convention rolled around, Indian uprisings had occurred in the Ohio River Valley and Virginia, the Creeks and Georgia were on the brink of open warfare, and there was significant turmoil on the western frontier. Clinton 1995, at 1147. Those events were not lost on the framers. As they debated how to broker enduring peace, two predominant schools of thought emerged. Madison and his followers favored preventing intrusions on Indian land and interests, Hamilton and his adherents favored resort to military might. Ablavsky 2014, at 1035-1038. Both sides, however, found agreement on the need for a stronger federal government presence, without the impediment of state interference. Id., at 1038.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,199,"Even as the Constitutional Convention assembled, a committee of the Continental Congress noted that it had been long understood and pretty well ascertained that the Crown's absolute powers to manage Affairs with the Indians passed in its entirety to the Union following Independence, meaning that the laws of the State can have no effect upon a Tribe of Indians or their lands within the limits of the State so long as that Tribe is independent. 33 Journals of the Continental Congress 1774-1789, p. 458 (R. Hill ed. 1936). That had to be so, the committee observed, for the same reason that individual States could not enter treaties with foreign powers: The Indian Tribes are justly considered the common friends or enemies of the United States, and no particular State can have an exclusive interest in the management of Affairs with any of the Tribes. Id., at 459.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,200,"This understanding found its way directly into the text of the Constitution. The final version assigned the newly formed federal government a bundle of powers that encompassed all that is required for the regulation of the Nation's intercourse with the Indians. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 559. By contrast, the Constitution came with no indication that States had any similar sort of power. Indeed, it omitted the nettlesome language in the Articles about the legislative right of States. Not only that. The Constitution's express exclusion of Indians not taxed from the apportionment formula, Art. I, § 2, cl. 3, threw cold water on some States' attempts to claim that Tribes fell within their territory—and therefore their control. And, lest any doubt remain, the Constitution divested States of any power to enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation. § 10, cl. 1. By removing that diplomatic power, the Constitution's design also divested them of the leading tool for managing tribal relations at that time.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,201,"The Constitution's departure from the Articles' articulation was praised by many and criticized by some. Federalists (such as James Madison) applauded the fact that the new federal government would be unfettered by the Articles' constraints. The Federalist No. 42, p. 268 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Certain Anti-Federalists (including Abraham Yates Jr.) disfavored the total surrender into the hands of Congress of the management and regulation of the Indian affairs. Letter to Citizens of New York (June 13-14, 1788), in 20 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 1153, 1158 (J. Kaminski et al. eds. 2004) (emphasis added). At bottom, however, no one questioned that the Constitution took a view about where the power to manage Indian affairs would reside in the future. And no one doubted that it selected the federal government, not the States.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,202,"Early practice confirmed this understanding. The Washington Administration insisted that the federal government enjoyed exclusive constitutional authority over managing relationships with the Indian Tribes. Ablavsky 2015, at 1019. As President Washington put it, the federal government possessed the only authority of regulating an intercourse with the Tribes, and redressing their grievances. Letter to T. Mifflin (Sept. 4, 1790), in 6 The Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 396 (D. Twohig ed. 1996) (emphasis added). Even many state officials agreed with President Washington's assessment. Ablavsky 2015, at 1019. South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney acknowledged that the sole management of Indian affairs is committed to the general Government. Letter to G. Washington (Dec. 14, 1789), in 4 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 404 (D. Twohig ed. 1996). Other leading proponents of States' rights reluctantly drew the same conclusion. Under the present Constitution, Thomas Jefferson lamented, States lack any right to Treat with the Indians without the consent of the General Government. Letter to H. Knox (Aug. 10, 1791), in 22 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 27 (C. Cullen ed. 1986).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,203,"For its part, this Court understood the absence of state authority over tribal matters as a natural corollary of Tribes' inherent sovereignty. Precisely because Tribes exist as a distinct community, this Court concluded in Worcester, the laws of States can have no force as to them. 6 Pet. at 561. States could no more prescribe rules for Tribes than they could legislate for one another or a foreign sovereign. More than that, this Court recognized that the whole intercourse between the United States and each Tribe, is by our Constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States. Ibid. (emphasis added). State laws cannot interfere  forcibly with the relations established between the United States and an Indian Tribe, the regulation of which, according to the settled principles of our Constitution, are committed exclusively to the government of the Union. Ibid. (emphasis added). That principle, too, has endured. No one can contest the `historic immunity from state and local control' that the Tribes enjoy, nor the permissibility of constitutional provisions enacted to protect the Tribes' sovereign status. New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324, 332, 103 S.Ct. 2378, 76 L.Ed.2d 611 (1983). Tuck that point away too.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,205,"We now know that, at the founding, the Tribes retained their sovereignty. We know also that States have virtually no role to play in managing interactions with Tribes. From this, it follows that the only restriction on the power of Tribes in respect to their internal affairs arises when their actions conflict with the Constitution or laws of the United States. Roff v. Burney, 168 U.S. 218, 222, 18 S.Ct. 60, 42 L.Ed. 442 (1897). In cases like that, the Constitution provides, federal law must prevail. See Art. VI. This creates a hydraulic relationship between federal and tribal authority. The more the former expands, the more the latter shrinks. All of which raises the question: What powers does the federal government possess with respect to Tribes?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,207,"Because the federal government enjoys only limited and enumerated powers, we look to the Constitution's text. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). Notably, our founding document does not include a plenary federal authority over Tribes. Nor was this an accident, at least not in the final accounting. The framers considered a general Indian Affairs Clause but left it on the cutting-room floor. See L. Toler, The Missing Indian Affairs Clause, 88 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 444-476 (2021) (Toler). That choice reflects an important insight about the Constitution's Indian-law bargain: Without an Indian affairs power, any assertion of unbounded federal authority over the Tribes is constitutionally wanting. Id., at 476.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,208,"Instead of a free-floating Indian-affairs power, the framers opted for a bundle of federal authorities tailored to the regulation of the Nation's intercourse with the Indians. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 559. In keeping with the framers' faith in the separation of powers, they chose to split those authorities between the Executive and the Legislature. Toler 479. The residue of Indian affairs power—all those Indian-related powers not expressly doled out by the Constitution—remained the province of the sovereign Tribes. Id., at 481.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,209,"What was included in the federal government's bundle of enumerated powers? In the early years, the most important component was the authority to make Treaties with the Tribes. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. But other provisions also facilitated the management of Indian relations. The Constitution vested in Congress the power to declare War against the Tribes. Art. I., § 8, cl. 11. It gave Congress authority to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States, allowing it considerable power over Indians on federal territory. Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. The Constitution also authorized Congress to employ its spending power to divert funds toward Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Where all those powers came up short, the Constitution afforded the federal government the power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several  States, and with the Indian Tribes. § 8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). Much of modern federal Indian law rests on that commerce power. It demands a closer look.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,211,"Contained in a single sentence, what we sometimes call the Commerce Clause is really three distinct Clauses rolled into one: a Foreign Commerce Clause, an Interstate Commerce Clause, and an Indian Commerce Clause. To be sure, those Clauses share the same lead word: Commerce. And, viewed in isolation, that word might appear to sweep narrowly—encompassing activities like selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 585-586, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citing founding-era definitions). But it is well established that the individual Commerce Clauses have very different applications, Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 192, 109 S.Ct. 1698, 104 L.Ed.2d 209 (1989), a point the framers themselves acknowledged, see, e.g., Letter from E. Randolph to G. Washington (Feb. 12, 1791), in 7 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 330, 331-337 (D. Twohig 1998).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,212,"Start with the word Commerce. From the Nation's earliest days, Indian commerce was considered a special subject with a definite content, quite distinct and specialized from other sorts of commerce. A. Abel, The Commerce Clause in the Constitutional Convention and in Contemporary Comment, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 432, 467-468 (1941). A survey of founding-era usage confirms that the term Commerce, when describing relations with Indians, took on a broader meaning than simple economic exchange. See Ablavsky 2015, at 1012-1032 (compiling primary sources), Brief for Gregory Ablavsky as Amicus Curiae 8-11, App. to id., at 1-18 (same), see also A. Amar, America's Constitution: A Biography 107 (2005). Instead, the word was used as a term of art, Pearl 322, to encompass all manner of bilateral relations with the Tribes, Clinton 1995, at 1145, see also Toler 422 (noting that Indian commerce was a legal term of art that was informed by the practicalities of Indian affairs).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,213,"This special usage likely emerged out of an international-law idea widely shared at the time of the founding: When dealing with a foreign sovereign, the commercial and noncommercial aspects of bilateral interactions were inevitably intertwined because any intercourse carried potential diplomatic consequences and could even lead to war. J. Balkin, Commerce, 109 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 25 (2010) (Balkin), see also Ablavsky 2015, at 1028-1032 (demonstrating that trade with the Indians was understood almost solely through this political and diplomatic lens), Clinton 1989, at 362-363 (observing that, at the founding, Indian trade was intertwined with concerns of peace and diplomacy and with the threat of war). Nor was that a speculative possibility when it came to Tribes. As we have seen, even the noncommercial conduct of settlers in the early years was a continual source of violent conflict with Indians, partially motivating the move away from the Articles of Confederation framework. M. Fletcher & L. Jurss, Tribal Jurisdiction—A Historical Bargain, 76 Md. L. Rev. 593, 597 (2017), see also Ablavsky 2014, at 1033-1038.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,214,"At least two terms in the Commerce Clause confirm this special usage. For one thing, the Constitution speaks of Commerce among when discussing interstate dealings, but Commerce with when addressing dealings with tribal and foreign sovereigns. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3 (emphases added). This language suggests a shared  framework for Congress's Indian and foreign commerce powers and a different one for its interstate commerce authority. See R. Monette, A New Federalism for Indian Tribes: The Relationship Between the United States and Tribes in Light of Our Federalism and Republican Democracy, 25 U. Toledo L. Rev. 617, 629, n. 82 (1994). More than that, the term with suggests that Congress has the authority to manage all interactions or affairs  with the Indian Tribes and foreign sovereigns— wherever those interactions or affairs may occur. Balkin 23. By contrast, the term among found in the Interstate Commerce Clause most naturally suggests that Congress may regulate only activities that extend in their operation beyond the bounds of a particular State and into another. Id., at 30. All this goes a long way toward explaining why Congress's powers to regulate domestic commerce are more constrained than its powers to regulate Indian and foreign commerce. Id., at 29.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,215,"For another thing, as nouns, States and Indian Tribes are not alike—and they were not alike at the founding. States generally referred then, as it does today, to a collection of territorial entities. Not so Tribes. That term necessarily referred to collections of individuals. See C. Green, Tribes, Nations, States: Our Three Commerce Powers, 127 Pa. St. L. Rev. 643, 649, 654-669 (2023) (Green), see also 1 W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 77 (1953). Want proof? Dust off most any founding-era dictionary and look up the definition of Tribe. See, e.g., 2 J. Ash, The New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775) (a family, a body of the people distinguished by family or fortune), 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 1773) (a distinct body of the people as divided by family or fortune, or any other characteristick), T. Dyche, A New General English Dictionary (14th ed. 1771) (the particular descendants or people sprung from some noted head, or a collective number of people in a colony), N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (22d ed. 1770) (a company of people dwelling together in the same ward or liberty).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,216,"This observation sheds light on why ordinary speakers use the two terms differently. It explains, for instance, why it is grammatical to say you are vacationing in Colorado, but not to say you are vacationing in Navajo. It explains why it is sensible to say you are meeting with some Cherokee, but not to say you are meeting with some New Jersey. But this point also helps us make sense of why the Legislative Branch may regulate commerce with Indian Tribes differently than it may regulate commerce among the States. Because Tribes are collections of people, the Indian Commerce Clause endows Congress with the authority to regulate commerce with Native Americans as individuals. McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 207 L.Ed.2d 985 (2020). By contrast, Congress's power under the Interstate Commerce Clause operates only on commerce that involves more States than one. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824). In other words, commerce that takes place among (or between) two or more territorial units, and not just any commerce that involves some member of some State. See Green 649-654.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,217,"This Court has long appreciated these points of distinction. For example, in United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 18 L.Ed. 182 (1866), the Court upheld a federal statute that prohibited the sale of alcohol by non-Indians to Indians—on or off tribal land. Id., at 416-417. Giving the Indian Commerce Clause its most natural reading, the Court concluded that the power to regulate commerce with Indian Tribes  must mean the power to regulate commerce with the individuals composing those Tribes. Id., at 417 (emphasis added). For that reason, too, the locality of the commerce could have nothing to do with the scope of the power. Id., at 418, see also Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92 U.S. 259, 270, 23 L.Ed. 543 (1876) (quoting Holliday and echoing this point in the context of the Foreign Commerce Clause). More than that, Holliday recognized that this focus on individuals means that Indian commerce must cover something more than just economic exchange. 3 Wall. at 417 (internal quotation marks omitted). While it includes buying and selling and exchanging commodities, it also extends to the entire intercourse between the citizens of the United States and those Tribes. Ibid. That intercourse, the Court recognized, is another branch of commerce with Indians, and a very important one at that. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,218,"If the Constitution's text left any uncertainty about the scope of Congress's Indian commerce power, early practice liquidated it. The First Congress adopted the initial Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which prohibited the sale of lands made by any Indians to non-Indians absent a public treaty. Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, § 4, 1 Stat. 138. The law also extended criminal liability to non-Indians who committed any crime upon, or trespass against, the person or property of any peaceable and friendly Indian in Indian country. § 5, ibid. The first of these provisions arguably addressed a narrow question of commerce. But the second plainly regulated noneconomic interaction. A. Amar, America's Constitution and the Yale School of Constitutional Interpretation, 115 Yale L. J. 1997, 2004, n. 25 (2006).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,219,"Despite that fact, the Act (and its successors) were not controversial exercises of congressional power. N. Newton, Federal Power Over Indians: Its Sources, Scope, and Limitations, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 195, 201, n. 25 (1984). Any doubt about their validity would have been quieted by the Commerce Clause's commitment of commerce with the Indian Tribes to Congress. Ibid. As Justice McLean (riding circuit) recognized, punishing non-Indians for committing violence upon the persons or property of the Indians, fell clearly within the scope of the power to regulate commerce with the Indian Tribes. United States v. Bailey, 24 F. Cas. 937, 939 (No. 14,495) (CCD Tenn. 1834). Of course, the kinds of criminal trespasses Congress regulated as early as 1790 were not themselves commercial. But a trespass against even one individual Indian could disrupt commerce with that individual. See Green 660-661, and n. 76. By extension, such a trespass could disrupt dealings with other members of the Tribe and with other allied Tribes too. See Balkin 24-26. Recognizing this, the framers entrusted Congress with the power previously exercised by the British Parliament to restrain the disorderly and licentious from intrusions by non-Indians against even individual Indians —all to preserve functioning channels of trade and intercourse with the Indians. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 552, 556.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,221,"If Congress's powers under the Indian Commerce Clause are broader than those it enjoys under the Interstate Commerce Clause, broader does not mean plenary. Even the federal government's power to control and manage relations with the Tribes under the Indian Commerce Clause comes with pertinent constitutional restrictions. United States v. Creek Nation, 295 U.S. 103, 110, 55 S.Ct. 681, 79 L.Ed. 1331 (1935). Congress cannot, for example, expand the scope of its own power by arbitrarily labeling non-Indians as Indians. See United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,222,"28, 46, 34 S.Ct. 1, 58 L.Ed. 107 (1913). Nor can it regulate in peripherally related fields merely by identifying some incidental connection to non-Indians' dealings with Indians. Instead, Congress's actions must still bear a valid nexus to Indian commerce to withstand constitutional challenge. Lopez, 514 U.S. at 562, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971)). As we have seen, too, the scope of congressional authority over the Tribes under the Indian Commerce Clause is best construed as a negative one. Pearl 325. Its text limits the legislative reach to creating federal restrictions concerning what United States citizens and States may do in the context of Indian Tribes. Ibid. Nothing in the Clause grants Congress the affirmative power to reassign to the federal government inherent sovereign authorities that belong to the Tribes.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,223,"In that way, the Indian Commerce Clause confirms, rather than abridges, principles of tribal sovereignty. As it must. It is inconceivable that a power to regulate non-Indians' dealings with Indians could be used to divest Tribes of the right of self-government. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 554. Otherwise, a power to manage relations with a party would become an instrument for annihilating the political existence of one of the parties. Ibid. No one in the Nation's formative years thought that could be the law. They understood that Congress could no more use its commerce powers to legislate away a Tribe than it could a State or a foreign sovereign. Cf. National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 855, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976), Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U.S. 514, 523-526, 46 S.Ct. 172, 70 L.Ed. 384 (1926), Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76-77, 19 L.Ed. 101 (1869). The framers appreciated, too, that they possessed no more authority to delegate to the national government power to regulate the Tribes directly than they possessed authority to delegate power to the federal government over other peoples who were not part of the federal union. Clinton 2002, at 254, see also R. Barsh, Book Review, Felix S. Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law, 1982 Ed., 57 Wash. L. Rev. 799, 803 (1982).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,225,"As we have now seen, the Constitution reflected a carefully considered balance between tribal, state, and federal powers. That scheme predated the founding and it persisted long after. It is not, however, the balance this Court always maintained in the years since. More than a little fault for that fact lies with a doctrinal misstep. In the late 19th century, this Court misplaced the original meaning of the Indian Commerce Clause. That error sent this Court's Indian-law jurisprudence into a tailspin from which it has only recently begun to recover. Understanding that error—and the steps this Court has taken to correct it—are the last missing pieces of the puzzle.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,226,"In 1885, during the period of assimilationist federal policy, Congress enacted the Indian Major Crimes Act, § 9, 23 Stat. 385. Among other things, that law extended federal-court jurisdiction over various crimes committed by Indians against Indians on tribal lands. Ibid. In United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886), this Court upheld the constitutionality of that Act. In the process, though, it stepped off the doctrinal trail. Instead of examining the text and history of the Indian Commerce Clause, the Court offered a free-floating and purposivist account of the Constitution, describing it as extending broad power to the General Government over tribal affairs. Id., at 384, 6 S.Ct. 1109. Building on that move, the Court would later come to  describe the federal power over the Tribes as plenary. See, e.g., Winton v. Amos, 255 U.S. 373, 391, 41 S.Ct. 342, 65 L.Ed. 684 (1921), Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 565, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,227,"Perhaps the Court meant well. Surely many of its so-called plenary power cases reached results explainable under a proper reading of the Constitution's enumerated powers. Maybe the turn of phrase even made some sense: Congress's power with regard to the Tribes is plenary in that it leaves no room for State involvement. See Ablavsky 2015, at 1014 (The Court used the term plenary interchangeably with `exclusive'). But as sometimes happens when this Court elides text and original meaning in favor of broad pronouncements about the Constitution's purposes, the plenary-power idea baked in the prejudices of the day. Cf. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896). The Court suggested that the federal government's total power over the Tribes derived from its supposedly inherent right to enforce its laws over the remnants of a race once powerful, now weak. Kagama, 118 U.S. at 384-385, 6 S.Ct. 1109. Of course, nothing of the sort follows from a reasoned analysis derived from the text or history  of the United States Constitution. Clinton 2002, at 163. Instead, the plenary-power idea constituted an unprincipled assertion of raw federal authority. Ibid. It rested on nothing more than judicial claims about putative constitutional purposes that aligned with contemporary policy preferences.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,228,"Nor was anachronistic language the only consequence of this Court's abandonment of the Constitution's original meaning. During what has been called the high plenary power era of U. S. Indian law, this Court sometimes took the word plenary pretty literally. S. Cleveland, Powers Inherent in Sovereignty: Indians, Aliens, Territories, and the Nineteenth Century Origins of Plenary Power Over Foreign Affairs, 81 Texas L. Rev. 1, 62 (2002) (Cleveland). It assumed that Congress possesses a virtually unlimited authority to regulate Tribes in every respect. M. Steele, Plenary Power, Political Questions, and Sovereignty in Indian Affairs, 63 UCLA L. Rev. 666, 670 (2016), see Cleveland 62-74. Perhaps most notably, the Court even suggested that Congress's plenary authority might allow it to limit, modify, or eliminate the powers of local self-government which the Tribes otherwise possess. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56-57, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978). It is an inconceivable suggestion for anyone who takes the Constitution's original meaning seriously. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 554.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,229,"The Court's atextual and ahistorical plenary-power move did not just serve to expand the scope of federal power over the Tribes. It also had predictable downstream effects on the relationship between States and Tribes. As Congress assumed new power to intrude on tribal sovereignty, the Constitution's concomitant jurisdictional limit on the reach of state law began to wane. McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 171, 93 S.Ct. 1257. It is not hard to draw a through-line between these developments. This Court itself has acknowledged that its plenary-power cases embodied a trend away from the idea of inherent Indian sovereignty as a bar to state jurisdiction. Id., at 172, and n. 7, 93 S.Ct. 1257.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,230,"It is no coincidence either that this Court's plenary-power jurisprudence emerged in the same era as Indian boarding schools and other assimilationist policies. See D. Moore & M. Steele, Revitalizing Tribal Sovereignty in Treatymaking, 97 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 137, 142 (2022). Rather, federal bureaucratic control  over Indian leadership and governments ran parallel to the government's control over Indian children during this period. Fletcher & Singel 930. Indian boarding schools and other intrusive federal educational programs  could not have been implemented without federal control of reservation governance. Ibid. Nor could any of these federal intrusions on internal tribal affairs have been possible without this Court's plenary-power misadventure.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,231,"I do not mean to overstate the point. Even in the heyday of the plenary-power theory, this Court never doubted that Tribes retain a variety of self-government powers. It has always acknowledged that Tribes are a separate people, with the power of regulating their internal and social relations. Kagama, 118 U.S. at 381-382, 6 S.Ct. 1109. They may make their own substantive law in internal matters. Martinez, 436 U.S. at 55, 98 S.Ct. 1670. They may define their own membership. Roff, 168 U.S. at 222, 18 S.Ct. 60. They may set probate rules of their choice. Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1, 29, 20 S.Ct. 1, 44 L.Ed. 49 (1899). And—especially relevant here—they may handle their own family-law matters, Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U.S. 382, 387, 96 S.Ct. 943, 47 L.Ed.2d 106 (1976) (per curiam), and domestic disputes, United States v. Quiver, 241 U.S. 602, 605, 36 S.Ct. 699, 60 L.Ed. 1196 (1916). But for a period at least, this Court let itself drift from the basic policy of Worcester, and with it the Constitution's promise of tribal sovereignty. Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 219, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,232,"Doubtless, too, the rise of the plenary-power theory injected incoherence into our Indian-law jurisprudence. Many scholars have commented on it. See, e.g., P. Frickey, Doctrine, Context, Institutional Relationships, and Commentary: The Malaise of Federal Indian Law Through the Lens of Lone Wolf, 38 Tulsa L. Rev. 5, 9 (2002) (describing our doctrine as riddled with inconsistency), F. Pommersheim, A Path Near the Clearing: An Essay on Constitutional Adjudication in Tribal Courts, 27 Gonz. L. Rev. 393, 403 (1991) (calling our doctrine bifurcated, if not fully schizophrenic). So have Members of this Court. Justice THOMAS has put the problem well: Much of the confusion reflected in our precedent arises from two largely incompatible assumptions: That Congress can regulate virtually every aspect of the Tribes, and that Indian Tribes retain inherent sovereignty. Lara, 541 U.S. at 214-215, 124 S.Ct. 1628 (opinion concurring in judgment). Those two propositions of course clash. That is because only one is true. Yes, Tribes retain the inherent sovereignty the Constitution left for them. But no, Congress does not possess power to calibrate `the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty.' Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,233,"In recent years, this Court has begun to correct its mistake. Increasingly, it has emphasized original meaning in constitutional interpretation. See, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist., 597 U. S. ___, ___-___, 142 S.Ct. 2407, 2427-2429, 213 L.Ed.2d 755 (2022), Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 1390, 1396-1397, 1399-1403, 206 L.Ed.2d 583 (2020). In the process, it has come again to recognize the Indian Commerce Clause provides the federal government only so much power to deal with the Indian Tribes. Mancari, 417 U.S. at 551-552, 94 S.Ct. 2474. But to date, these corrective steps have not yielded all they should. While this Court has stopped overreading its own plenary-power precedents, it has yet to recover fully the original meaning of the Indian Commerce Clause.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,234,"Today, the Court takes further steps in the right direction. It recognizes that Congress's powers with respect to the Tribes derive from the Constitution, not the atmosphere. Ante, at 1627. It engages in a robust history-driven analysis of the various fonts of congressional authority without relying only on platitudes about plenary power. Ante, at 1627-1629. It notes that, as an original matter, the Indian Commerce Clause is broad and covers more than garden-variety commercial activity. Ante, at 1627-1631. In the process, it reaffirms that `commerce with the Indian Tribes' necessarily covers commerce with Indians as individuals. Ante, at 1630.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,235,"No less importantly, the Court acknowledges what the federal government cannot do. Article I gives Congress a series of enumerated powers, not a series of blank checks. Ante, at 1629. And that means that Congress's authority to legislate with respect to Indians is not unbounded, but instead comes with concrete limitations. Ibid. To resolve the present dispute, the Court understandably sees no need to demarcate those limitations further. But I hope that, in time, it will follow the implications of today's decision where they lead and return us to the original bargain struck in the Constitution—and, with it, the respect for Indian sovereignty it entails.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,237,"With all the historical pieces of this puzzle assembled, only one task remains. You must decide for yourself if ICWA passes constitutional muster.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,238,"By now, the full picture has come into view and it is easy to see why ICWA must stand. Under our Constitution, Tribes remain independent sovereigns responsible for governing their own affairs. And as this Court has long recognized, domestic law arrangements fall within Tribes' traditional powers of self-governance. See, e.g., Fisher, 424 U.S. at 387, 96 S.Ct. 943, Quiver, 241 U.S. at 605, 36 S.Ct. 699. As `a separate people' Tribes may `regulate their internal and social relations' as they wish. Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 322, 98 S.Ct. 1079 (quoting Kagama, 118 U.S. at 381-382, 6 S.Ct. 1109). In enacting ICWA, Congress affirmed this understanding. It recognized that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian Tribes than their children. 25 U.S.C. § 1901(3). Yet it also recognized that the mass-removal of Indian children by States and other outsiders threatened the continued existence and integrity of Indian Tribes. Ibid., see also § 1901(4). By setting out to eliminate that practice, Congress sought to preserve the Indian-law bargain written into the Constitution's text by securing the continued viability of the third sovereign. S. O'Connor, Remark, Lessons From the Third Sovereign: Indian Tribal Courts, 33 Tulsa L. J. 1 (1997).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,239,"No doubt, ICWA sharply limits the ability of States to impose their own family-law policies on tribal members. But as we have seen, state intrusions on tribal authority have been a recurring theme throughout American history. See Ablavsky 2014, at 1009-1037. Long ago, those intrusions led the framers to abandon the loophole-ridden Indian affairs provision in the Articles of Confederation and adopt in the Constitution a different arrangement that commits the management of tribal relations solely to the federal government. Id., at 1038-1051, see also Clinton 1995, at 1098-1165. Recognizing as much, this Court has consistently reaffirmed the Tribes' immunity from state and local control. Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Ariz., 463 U.S. 545, 571, 103 S.Ct. 3201, 77 L.Ed.2d 837 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,240,"If that immunity means anything, it must mean that States and others cannot use their own laws to displace federal Indian policy.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,241,"Nor is there any serious question that Congress has the power under the Indian Commerce Clause to enact protections against the removal of Indian children. Thankfully, Indian children are not (these days) units of commerce. Cf. Fletcher & Singel 897-898 (describing an early practice of enslaving Indian children). But at its core, ICWA restricts how non-Indians (States and private individuals) may engage with Indians. And, as we have seen, that falls in the heartland of Congress's constitutional authority. Recall that the very first Congresses punished non-Indians who committed any crime upon any friendly Indian. Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, § 5, 1 Stat. 138. ICWA operates in much the same way. The mass removal of Indian children by States and private parties, no less than a pattern of criminal trespasses by States and private parties, directly interferes with tribal intercourse. More than that, it threatens the Tribes' political existence. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 536. And at the risk of stating the obvious, Indian commerce is hard to maintain if there are no Indian communities left to do commerce with.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,243,"Often, Native American Tribes have come to this Court seeking justice only to leave with bowed heads and empty hands. But that is not because this Court has no justice to offer them. Our Constitution reserves for the Tribes a place—an enduring place—in the structure of American life. It promises them sovereignty for as long as they wish to keep it. And it secures that promise by divesting States of authority over Indian affairs and by giving the federal government certain significant (but limited and enumerated) powers aimed at building a lasting peace. In adopting the Indian Child Welfare Act, Congress exercised that lawful authority to secure the right of Indian parents to raise their families as they please, the right of Indian children to grow in their culture, and the right of Indian communities to resist fading into the twilight of history. All of that is in keeping with the Constitution's original design.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-018,244,"Justice KAVANAUGH, concurring.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-018,245,"I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to emphasize that the Court today does not address or decide the equal protection issue that can arise when the Indian Child Welfare Act is applied in individual foster care or adoption proceedings. See ante, at 1638, 1640, n. 10. As the Court explains, the plaintiffs in this federal-court suit against federal parties lack standing to raise the equal protection issue. So the equal protection issue remains undecided.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-018,246,"In my view, the equal protection issue is serious. Under the Act, a child in foster care or adoption proceedings may in some cases be denied a particular placement because of the child's race—even if the placement is otherwise determined to be in the child's best interests. And a prospective foster or adoptive parent may in some cases be denied the opportunity to foster or adopt a child because of the prospective parent's race. Those scenarios raise significant questions under bedrock equal protection principles and this Court's precedents. See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984). Courts, including ultimately this Court, will be able to address the equal protection issue when it is properly raised by a plaintiff with standing—for example, by a prospective foster or adoptive parent or child in a case arising out of a state-court foster care or  adoption proceeding. See ante, at 1638, 1640, n. 10.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-018,247,"Justice THOMAS, dissenting.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,248,"These cases concern the Federal Government's attempt to regulate child-welfare proceedings in state courts. That should raise alarm bells. Our Federal Government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers, having only those powers that the Constitution confers expressly or by necessary implication. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). All other powers (like family or criminal law) generally remain with the States. The Federal Government thus lacks a general police power to regulate state family law.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,249,"However, in the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), Congress ignored the normal limits on the Federal Government's power and prescribed rules to regulate state child custody proceedings in one circumstance: when the child involved happens to be an Indian. As the majority acknowledges, ICWA often overrides state family law by dictating that state courts place Indian children with Indian caretakers even if doing so is not in the child's best interest. See ante, at 1622-1623. It imposes heightened standards before removing Indian children from unsafe environments. See ante, at 1623-1624. And it allows tribes to unilaterally enroll Indian children and then intervene in their custody proceedings. See ante, at 1623-1624, 1625-1626.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,250,"In the normal course, we would say that the Federal Government has no authority to enact any of this. Yet the majority declines to hold that ICWA is unconstitutional, reasoning that the petitioners before us have not borne their burden of showing how Congress exceeded its powers. This gets things backwards. When Congress has so clearly intruded upon a longstanding domain of exclusive state powers, we must ask not whether a constitutional provision prohibits that intrusion, but whether a constitutional provision authorizes it.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,251,"The majority and respondents gesture to a smorgasbord of constitutional hooks to support ICWA, not one of them works. First, the Indian Commerce Clause is about commerce, not children. See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 570 U.S. 637, 659-665, 133 S.Ct. 2552, 186 L.Ed.2d 729 (2013) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Second, the Treaty Clause does no work because ICWA is not based on any treaty. Third, the foreign-affairs powers (what the majority terms structural principles) inherent in the Federal Government have no application to regulating the domestic child custody proceedings of U. S. citizens living within the jurisdiction of States.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,252,"I would go no further. But, as the majority notes, the Court's precedents have repeatedly referred to a plenary power that Congress possesses over Indian affairs, as well as a general trust relationship with the Indians. I have searched in vain for any constitutional basis for such a plenary power, which appears to have been born of loose language and judicial ipse dixit. And, even taking the Court's precedents as given, there is no reason to extend this plenary power to the situation before us today: regulating state-court child custody proceedings of U. S. citizens, who may never have even set foot on Indian lands, merely because the child involved happens to be an Indian.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,254,"State courts usually apply state law when resolving child custody issues. This would normally be true for most Indians, too. Today, Indians are citizens of the United States, the vast majority of them do not live on any reservation or Indian lands, but live (as most citizens) on lands  that are wholly within a State's jurisdiction. See ch. 233, 43 Stat. 253, Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, Profile: American Indian/Alaska Native (Feb. 24, 2023), https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=3&lvlid=62 (87% live off Indian lands). Thus, one might expect that when a child custody issue regarding an Indian child arises in a state court, that court would apply the same laws that it would for any other citizen.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,255,"But ICWA displaces the normal state laws governing child custody when it comes to only one group of citizens: Indian children. ICWA defines Indian child capaciously: It includes not only children who are members of an Indian tribe, but also those children who are merely eligible for membership in a tribe and are the biological child of a tribal member. See 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4). If the child resides on Indian tribal lands, then the Indian tribal court has jurisdiction. § 1911(a). But, if the child resides within a State, ICWA requires state courts to transfer any proceedings to a tribal court, absent good cause to the contrary, upon petition by the child's parent, custodian, or tribe. § 1911(b).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,256,"Even when the state court retains the proceedings, ICWA replaces state law with a strict set of federal rules. For example, if the State fears that a child is suffering physical or sexual abuse, it must clear a set of hurdles before placing the child in foster care or terminating the parent's rights. §§ 1912(a)-(e). If the parent wishes to voluntarily relinquish his or her rights and facilitate an adoption, the child's tribe has a right to intervene at any point and to collaterally attack the court's decree. §§ 1911(c), 1914. Moreover, it appears that tribes can enroll children unilaterally, without the parent's consent. Accordingly, even if the biological parents, the child, the adoptive parents, and the court all agree on what is best for the child, the tribe can intervene at the eleventh hour, without any consent from the parents or child, and block the proceedings. In fact, that is exactly what happened here—the children were unilaterally designated as tribal members by tribes, which then sought to block adoptions that everyone else thought were best for the children involved. And, even though some of those adoptions have now been finalized, it appears that the tribes can collaterally attack them for an indefinite period of time. § 1914.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,257,"Besides these procedural hurdles, ICWA dictates the preferences a court must adhere to when deciding where to place the child. In the typical case, the primary consideration would be the best interests of that child. E.g., Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.002 (West 2014), American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution § 2.02 (2002), Friederwitzer v. Friederwitzer, 55 N.Y.2d 89, 92, 432 N.E.2d 765, 767, 447 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1982), Karner v. McMahon, 433 Pa.Super. 290, 302, 640 A.2d 926, 932 (1994). That makes sense, as the majority notes, these children are some of the most vulnerable among us, and their interests should be a court's primary concern. See ante, at 1622. But ICWA displaces that standard with its own hierarchy of preferences, requiring a court to prefer any placements with (1) a member of the child's extended family, (2) other members of the child's tribe, and (3) other Indian families of any tribe, anywhere in the country. § 1915(a). Similar rules govern foster-care placements. § 1915(b). As the majority notes, these preferences collectively ensure that any Indian from any tribe in the country outranks all non-Indians for adopting and fostering those whom ICWA deems to be Indian children. See ante, at 1624-1625.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,258,"Again, these detailed rules govern the child custody proceedings of U. S. citizens in state courts only because the child is also either a member of an Indian tribe or merely eligible for membership in a tribe. (The child or parents need never have set foot on Indian lands or have any desire to affiliate themselves with a tribe.1) The child and his or her biological parents and relatives can all support an adoption, yet ICWA may stand in the way.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,259,"Normally, we would say that the Federal Government plainly lacks the authority to enact a law like this. The only question is thus whether Congress has some additional authority that allows it to regulate the adoption process for U. S. citizens in state courts merely because the child involved happens to be an Indian. To answer that question, I turn first to the text and original meaning of the Constitution.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,261,"To explain the original understanding of the Constitution's enumerated powers with regard to Indians, I start with our Nation's Founding-era dealings with Indian tribes. Those early interactions underscore that the Constitution conferred specific, enumerated powers on the Federal Government which aimed at specific problems that the Nation faced under the Articles of Confederation. The new Federal Government's actions with respect to Indian tribes are easily explained by those enumerated powers. Meanwhile, the States continued to enjoy substantial authority with regard to tribes. At each turn, history and constitutional text thus point to a set of enumerated powers that can be applied to Indian tribes—not some sort of amorphous, unlimited power than can be applied to displace all state laws when it comes to Indians.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,263,"Before the Revolution, most of the Thirteen Colonies adopted their own regulations governing Indian trade. See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 660, 133 S.Ct. 2552 (THOMAS, J., concurring), R. Natelson, The Original Understanding of the Indian Commerce Clause, 85 Denver U. L. Rev. 201, 219, and n. 121 (2007) (Natelson) (collecting laws). These regulations were necessary because colonial traders abused their Indian trading partners, often provoking violent Indian retaliation. See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 660-661, 133 S.Ct. 2552, 1 F. Prucha, The Great Father 18-21 (1984) (Prucha). Most colonial governments thus imposed licensing systems of some form both to protect Indians and to maintain trading relationships with them. See id., at 19. However, the colonial laws were not uniform, leading to rivalries between the Colonies, corruption, fraud, and other abuses by traders. Id., at 21. Then, once the Nation had achieved independence, it faced innumerable difficulties, id., at 46, from finding ways to uphold its treaties with foreign nations to economic upheaval at home, J. Marshall, The Life of George Washington 313-316 (R. Faulkner & P. Carrese eds. 2000). Peace with the Indians, rather than conflicts sparked by unscrupulous traders, was imperative. Prucha 46.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,264,"The Articles of Confederation aimed to meet that need in part by giving Congress the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians. Art. IX, cl. 4. However, that broad power came with two limitations: First, the Indians could not be  members of any of the states. Ibid. And, second, the legislative right of any state within its own limits could not be infringed or violated. Ibid. In part because of those limitations, the Articles' solution proved to be less than ideal. As James Madison would later write, the two limits were obscure and contradictory, the new Nation had not yet settled on which Indians were members of a State or which state legislative rights could not be infringed. The Federalist No. 42, pp. 268-269 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).2 More broadly, the Confederation Congress lacked any robust authority to enforce congressional laws or treaties (in this or any other domain). For example, it had no power to make laws supreme over state law, there was no executive power independent of the States, and state officers were not bound by oath to support the Articles.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,265,"Under the Articles, Congress entered treaties with various tribes and sought to maintain a mostly peaceful relationship with the Indians—but its authority was undermined at every turn. See Prucha 44-50. Again and again, Congress entered treaties with Indians that established boundary lines and lands set apart for the Indians, and again and again, frontier settlers encroached on Indian territory and committed acts that violated those treaties. Id., at 46-48, F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 1.023, pp. 21-22 (2012) (Cohen). Such violations were taken seriously, as offenses against the laws of nations, they provoked the Indians and provided just causes of war. The Federalist No. 3, at 44 (J. Jay), see also 2 E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations §§ 71-76, pp. 161-163 (J. Chitty ed. 1876).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,266,"Yet the Confederation Congress was almost powerless to stop these abuses. After a committee noted confusion about the extent of congressional power over Indian affairs in 1787, Congress had to ask the States for their cooperation in curbing the abuses that their own citizens were perpetrating. Prucha 48-49. The weakness of Congress meant, however, that federal attempts to check state intrusions were often ignored. Cohen § 1.023, at 22. The result was that, by the time of the Constitutional Convention, the young nation stood on the brink of Indian warfare on several fronts. Ibid. Such a war, feared some Founders, could be destructive to the fledgling Republic. See G. Ablavsky, The Savage Constitution, 63 Duke L. J. 999, 1033 (2014).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,267,"The Constitution addressed those problems in several ways. First and most plainly, the Constitution made all federal treaties and laws the supreme Law of the Land, notwithstanding the laws of any State. Art. VI. It empowered Congress not only to declare War, but also to raise and support Armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union. Art. I, § 8. It enabled Congress to define and punish  Offences against the Law of Nations. Ibid. And it granted Congress the authority to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying out any of those powers. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,268,"The Constitution also provided one power specific to Indian tribes: the power to regulate Commerce  with the Indian Tribes. § 8, cl. 3. That power, however, came very late in the drafting process and was narrower than initially proposed. See L. Toler, The Missing Indian Affairs  Clause, 88 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 444-464 (2021) (Toler). At two separate points, James Madison and John Rutledge proposed a power to `regulate affairs with the Indians,' a provision that would have mirrored the Articles. Id., at 447-448, 464-465 (emphasis added). Neither proposal received much debate, and both were rejected. See id., at 464-466. Instead, the Convention opted to include Indian tribes in a provision that had initially been drafted to include only power to `regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States.' See ibid. The Convention thus expanded the Commerce Clause to the form we know today, empowering Congress to `regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.' Id., at 466.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,269,"On top of those powers, one more warrants note. As I have written previously, the Constitution vests the President with certain foreign-affairs powers including the executive Power, which includes a residual authority over war, peace, and foreign interactions. See Art. II, Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 35-40, 135 S.Ct. 2076, 192 L.Ed.2d 83 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). From the start, Presidents have exercised foreign-affairs powers not specifically enumerated on matters ranging from maintaining the peace and issuing passports to communicating with foreign governments and repelling sudden attacks on the Nation. S. Prakash, Imperial From the Beginning 119-132 (2015). In his Neutrality Proclamation, for example, President Washington declared that the United States would remain strictly neutral in the then-ongoing war between England and France. See A Proclamation (Apr. 22, 1793), reprinted in 1 American State Papers 140 (W. Lowrie & M. Clarke eds. 1833). Congress supported his Proclamation by imposing criminal penalties on anyone who, among other things, went beyond the limits or jurisdiction of the United States with intent to be enlisted or entered in the service of any foreign prince or state. § 2, 1 Stat. 383. While this Court has at times debated whether those residual foreign-affairs powers are located in the Executive exclusively or the Federal Government more broadly, see Zivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 20-22, 135 S.Ct. 2076, it has long recognized the powers as arising from our constitutional framework and residing at the federal level, see, e.g., Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 318, 57 S.Ct. 216.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,271,"After the Constitution's ratification, the new Federal Government exercised its enumerated powers with regard to Indian tribes. To start, the Government embarked on an era of treaty-making with Indian tribes. See Cohen § 1.031, at 23. That treaty-focused policy reflected the Washington administration's view that Indian tribes were best dealt with as mostly foreign nations, with an eye towards peace lest frontier conflicts continue to plague the new Nation. See Letter from H. Knox to G. Washington (July 7, 1789), reprinted in 3 Papers of George Washington 138 (W. Abbot 1989), see also Toler 433-434. Many early treaties thus were treaties of peace and friendship, often providing for the restoration or exchange of prisoners or including mutual assistance pacts. Cohen § 1.031, at 25. Others dealt with passports and commercial affairs. Id., at 25-26. And many attested to the tribes' status as dependent nations, with the United States sometimes promising to protect the tribe. Id., at 26.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,272,"Unlike the Confederation Congress, the new Federal Government was no longer  powerless to maintain and enforce its treaties. Exercising its new military powers, the First Congress established a Department of War and vested the Department with authority over Indian affairs. See § 1, 1 Stat. 50. War Secretary Henry Knox then called for, and obtained, a line of garrisons in the Indian Country, in order to enforce the treaties and maintain the peace of the frontier. F. Prucha, American Indian Policy in the Formative Years 61 (1962) (Prucha, American Indian Policy). Those garrisons remained for years, working to prevent American settlers from illegally entering Indian country or otherwise stirring up conflicts. Id., at 61-63.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,273,"Meanwhile, President Washington exercised his diplomatic authority to maintain peace on the frontier. For example, when Pennsylvania settlers killed two members of the Seneca Nation, Washington appointed a federal agent to meet with the Seneca and `give the strongest assurances of the friendship of the United States towards that Tribe, and to make pecuniary satisfaction.' Letter to T. Mifflin (Sept. 4, 1790), reprinted in 6 Papers of George Washington 396 (D. Twohig ed. 1996). And, in line with his executive authority to regulate all intercourse with foreign powers, see 4 J. Elliot, Debates on the Constitution 126-127 (1863), Washington instructed Pennsylvania's Governor to refer the Seneca `to the Executive of the United States, as possessing the only authority of regulating an intercourse with them, and redressing their grievances,' Letter to T. Mifflin, in Papers of George Washington 396.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,274,"Congress too did its part, enacting a series of acts to regulate Trade and Intercourse with the Indian Tribes, and to preserve Peace on the Frontiers. See, e.g., 1 Stat. 469, 2 Stat. 139, 1 Stat. 137 (emphasis deleted). Those Trade and Intercourse Acts underscored the Federal Government's new powers and worked to establish a policy of peace and trade with Indian tribes. For example, the Acts threatened criminal penalties on any U. S. citizen who entered Indian lands and there committed crimes against Indians. See, e.g., id., at 137, see also Prucha, American Indian Policy 188-193. Though opponents of those provisions contended that they were unnecessary because state laws and some treaties already provided for criminal punishment, proponents explained that the provisions were needed for those who went out of the limits of any of the States and committed crimes that may not have been covered by a particular treaty. See 3 Annals of Cong. 751 (1792).3 Thus, as with the border garrisons, these provisions were meant as an answer to the charge that the United States did not respect its treaties with Indian tribes, Prucha 92, while also securing peace with the Indian tribes on the frontier, 3 Annals of Cong. 751. In that respect, they were much like the criminal penalties that Congress levied on those who went abroad and enlisted with England or France and thereby threatened the United States' peace with those nations. See 1 Stat. 383.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,275,"The Trade and Intercourse Acts further hammered out the Nation's diplomatic and territorial stance with respect to the Indian tribes. For example, reflecting the Federal Government's powers over commerce, territories, and foreign affairs, the Acts forbade U. S. citizens from purchasing,  surveying, or settling on Indian lands. E.g., id., at 329-330. One of the Acts, enacted in 1796, then drew a boundary line with Indian tribes and required citizens to have passports when entering Indian lands. Id., at 470. If an Indian came over the boundary line and committed a crime against a U. S. citizen, the Acts authorized the President to demand satisfaction from the tribe (while specifying that the Indian could be arrested within the limits of any state). See, e.g., § 14, id., at 472-473. Then, to prevent the tribes from allying themselves with European powers, Congress forbade people from conveying messages to Indian tribes from foreign states. 2 Stat. 6.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,276,"Congress also, of course, regulated trade with the Indian tribes. For example, the Acts continued the colonial practice of requiring licenses to trade with Indians and threatened penalties on anyone who sold or purchased goods from Indians without a license. See, e.g., 1 Stat. 329-330. To facilitate trade, Congress also established a series of trading houses on the frontiers, appropriating federal funds to set up the houses and purchase goods from Indians. See, e.g., id., at 443, 453-454, 2 Stat. 173. And, to promote civilization and secure the tribes' friendship, Congress appropriated funds for the President to furnish gifts to the Indians. See, e.g., § 13, 1 Stat. 472.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,277,"To be sure, these measures were not entirely successful, and the Federal Government's policy was not always one of peace. American frontiersmen continued to push into Indian lands, and the military garrisons sometimes could not stem the tide. See Prucha 62-63, 112. The Indians (often supported by the British) engaged in intermittent raids and attacks against American settlers, and the Federal Government and several confederated tribes fought a significant war in the Northwest Territories. Id., at 63-67, J. Yoo, Crisis and Command 75-79 (2011), M. Fletcher & W. Singel, Indian Children and the Federal-Tribal Trust Relationship, 95 Neb. L. Rev. 885, 904-905 (2017) (Fletcher & Singel). Additionally, the Federal Government often played tribes against each other to obtain land concessions by treaty, leading many tribes (again goaded by the British) to take up arms against the United States in the War of 1812. See Cohen § 1.033, at 39-41. In the aftermath of that conflict, Presidents Monroe and John Quincy Adams generally pursued a policy of assimilation or removing Indians west with their consent. Prucha, American Indian Policy 226-233. That policy then gave way to a more forceful policy of removing Indians west, particularly during the administration of President Andrew Jackson. Id., at 233-249, Cohen § 1.034, at 41-51, Prucha 193-195, 239-240.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,278,"But, at least until the War of 1812 (and, in large part, in the years after it), Founding-era Presidents' primary goals in this area were to achieve peace with the Indians, sustain trade with them, and obtain Indian lands through treaties. See id., at 32-33, 59, 61, 93. By establishing a peaceful and trade-oriented relationship with the Indians, the new country further hoped to exclude British Canada and other European powers that might seek alliances with the Indian tribes. See Cohen § 1.033, at 37-38, n. 102, 2 Stat. 6. During that time, the Federal Government's relationship with the Indians thus remained (as it did for nearly the first hundred years of our Nation) `more an aspect of military and foreign policy' than simple domestic law. See United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 201, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,280,"Notably, neither President Washington nor the first Congresses were particularly  concerned with the remnants of tribes that had been absorbed by the states and had come under their direction and control. Prucha 92. The first Trade and Intercourse Acts specifically provided that nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent any trade or intercourse with Indians living on lands surrounded by settlements of the citizens of the United States, and being within the jurisdiction of any of the individual states. § 13, 1 Stat. 331, § 19, id., at 474. And the Constitution's Apportionment Clause provided that representatives would be apportioned by the population of each State, excluding Indians not taxed—implying that there were Indians who paid taxes and were incorporated into the bodies politic of the States. Art. I, § 2, cl. 3.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,281,"The States accordingly enacted numerous laws to regulate Indians within their territorial boundaries, as well as those Indians' interactions with the States' citizens. See, e.g., D. Rosen, American Indians and State Law 34, 52 (2007) (Rosen). For example, New York passed laws forbidding its citizens from suing to enforce contracts with Indians who lived on Indian lands, and Virginia regulated the sale of land held by Indians. See Laws of the Colonial and State Governments, Relating to Indians and Indian Affairs, From 1633 to 1831, pp. 65-67, 158-159 (1832). Massachusetts authorized its Governor to appoint guardians to oversee Indians and their property, while Ohio and Indiana forbade the sale of liquor to Indians. Id., at 21-22, 232-234.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,282,"On the whole, States also generally applied both their civil and criminal laws to Indians, with many extending their criminal laws to all Indians anywhere in the State—including, sometimes, on Indian reservations within the State. See Rosen 53, see also, e.g., Goodell v. Jackson ex dem. Smith, 20 Johns. 693 (N. Y. Ct. Corr. Errors 1823), State v. Doxtater, 47 Wis. 278, 2 N.W. 439 (1879) (collecting cases). To be sure, some of these laws may have conflicted with valid federal treaties or statutes on point, and courts at the time often did not precisely demarcate the constitutional boundaries between state and federal authority. Rosen 55-56.4 But, when opponents of the Trade and Intercourse Acts' criminal provisions complained that state laws would take care of criminal offenses, the provisions' proponents did not reply that state laws were disabled on this point—they instead noted that citizens might go beyond the limits of States and commit crimes. See 3 Annals of Cong. 751. And notably, Congress' early statutes did not purport to regulate Indians either on or off Indian lands—they instead regulated and penalized only U. S. citizens who were trading with Indians or committing acts on Indian lands that threatened the peace with the tribes.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,283,"Those statutory lines reflected the early dynamic of federal-Indian relations, with Indian affairs counting as both a matter of quasi-foreign affairs and of state jurisdiction. For example, the early Trade and Intercourse Acts only demanded satisfaction from Indian tribes if an Indian went onto a State's land and committed a crime.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,284,"E.g., 1 Stat. 472-473. Under that regime, the Federal Government asserted no authority over the acts of Indians who lived on tribal lands—much less over Indians who lived off tribal lands and within a State's sole jurisdiction.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,285,"That general jurisdictional line held until 1817, when Congress first enacted a statute to impose penalties on anyone who committed a crime against a U. S. citizen while on Indian lands. See 3 Stat. 383. But Justice McLean, riding circuit, held that statute unconstitutional in 1834—at least as it applied to Indian lands located within the territorial limits of a State. See United States v. Bailey, 24 F.Cas. 937, (No. 14,495) (CCD Tenn.). As Justice McLean explained, that the federal government is one of limited powers, is a principle so obvious as not to admit of controversy. Id., at 938. Yet the Indian lands at issue were not located within a federal territory, and there had not been any cession of jurisdiction by the state of Tennessee. Id., at 939.5 Nor was the criminal statute in any way related to commerce with the Indian tribes. Ibid. Indeed, Justice McLean asked, if Congress could enact this statute, why may not Congress legislate on crimes for the states generally? Id., at 940. He concluded that Congress transcended their constitutional powers in asserting a general criminal jurisdiction over tribal lands within the limits of a State. Ibid. And, given the limited nature of the Federal Government's authority, state laws thus played a significant role in regulating Indians within the territorial limits of States. See id., at 939.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,287,"The Constitution's text and the foregoing history point to a set of discrete, enumerated powers applicable to Indian tribes—just as in any other context. Although our cases have at times suggested a broader power with respect to Indians, there is no evidence for such a free-floating authority anywhere in the text or original understanding of the Constitution. To the contrary, all of the Government's early acts with respect to Indians are easily explicable under our normal understanding of the Constitution's enumerated powers. For example, the Treaty Clause supported the Federal Government's treaties with Indians, and the Property Clause supported the gifts allocated to Indians. The powers to regulate territories and foreign affairs supported the regulation of passports and penalties for criminal acts on Indian lands. The various war-related powers supported military campaigns against Indian tribes. And the Commerce Clause supported the regulation of trade with Indian tribes.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,288,"Moreover, the Founders deliberately chose to enumerate one power specific to Indian tribes: the power to regulate Commerce with tribes. Because the Constitution contains one Indian-specific power, there is simply no reason to think that there is some sort of free-floating, unlimited power over all things related to Indians. That is common sense: expressio unius est exclusio alterius. And that is particularly true here, because the Founders adopted the Indian Commerce Clause while rejecting an arguably broader authority over Indian affairs. See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 662, 133 S.Ct. 2552. Accordingly, here as elsewhere, the Federal Government can exercise only its constitutionally enumerated powers. Because each of those  powers contains its own inherent limits, none of them can support an additional unbounded power over all Indian-related matters. Indeed, the history of the plenary power doctrine in Indian law shows that, from its inception, it has been a power in search of a constitutional basis—and the majority opinion shows that this is still the case.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,290,"As the majority notes, some of the candidates that this Court has suggested as the source of the plenary power are the Treaty Clause, the Commerce Clause, and principles inherent in the Constitution's structure. See ante, at 1627-1629, Lara, 541 U.S. at 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628. But each of those powers has clear, inherent limits, and not one suggests any sort of unlimited power over Indian affairs—much less a power to regulate U. S. citizens outside of Indian lands merely because those individuals happen to be Indians. I will discuss each in turn.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,292,"First, and most obviously, the Treaty Clause confers only the power to make Treaties, the Supremacy Clause then makes those treaties the supreme law of the land. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, Art. VI. Even under our most expansive Treaty Clause precedents, this power is still limited to actual treaties. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 854-855, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), id., at 893-894, 134 S.Ct. 2077 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (the Treaty Power supports treaties only on matters of international intercourse), Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 433-435, 40 S.Ct. 382, 64 L.Ed. 641 (1920). It does not confer a free-floating power over matters that might involve a party to a treaty.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,294,"Second, the Commerce Clause confers only the authority to regulate Commerce with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). At the time the original Constitution was ratified, `commerce' consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 585, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring), see also 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 361 (4th rev. ed. 1773) (reprint 1978) (defining commerce as Intercourse, exchange of one thing for another, interchange of any thing, trade, traffick). And even under our most expansive Commerce Clause precedents, the Clause permits Congress to regulate only economic activity like producing materials that will be sold or exchanged as a matter of commerce. See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 560, 115 S.Ct. 1624, Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 22, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005).6",Thomas,0,
2022-018,295,"The majority, however, suggests that the Commerce Clause could have a broader application with respect to Indian tribes than for commerce between States or with foreign nations. See ante, at 1627-1628,  1630-1631. That makes little textual sense. The Commerce Clause confers the power to regulate a single object—Commerce —that is then cabined by three prepositional phrases: with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Accordingly, one would naturally read the term Commerce as having the same meaning with respect to each type of Commerce the Clause proceeds to identify. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 74, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824). I would think that is how we would read, for example, the President's appointment power with respect to Ambassadors,  Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. There is no textual reason why the Commerce Clause would be different. Nor have the parties or the numerous amici presented any evidence that the Founders thought that the term Commerce in the Commerce Clause meant different things for Indian tribes than it did for commerce between States. See S. Prakash, Our Three Commerce Clauses and the Presumption of Intrasentence Uniformity, 55 Ark. L. Rev. 1149, 1161-1162 (2003).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,296,"Rather, the evidence points in the opposite direction. See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 659-660, 133 S.Ct. 2552 (THOMAS, J., concurring). When discussing commerce with Indian tribes, the Founders plainly meant buying and selling goods and transportation for that purpose. For example, President Washington once informed Congress of the need for new channels for the commerce of the Creeks, because their trade is liable to be interrupted by conflicts with England. Statement to the Senate (Aug. 4, 1790), reprinted in 4 American State Papers 80. Henry Knox similarly referred to the profits of this commerce with the Creeks in the context of a trading house which has the monopoly of the trade of the Creeks. Report (July 6, 1789), reprinted in id., at 15. And President Jefferson likewise discussed the commerce that shall be carried on liberally at trading houses with Indians. Statement to Congress (Jan. 18, 1803), reprinted in id., at 684.7 All of this makes sense, given that the Founders both wanted  to facilitate trade with Indians and rejected a facially broader Indian affairs power in favor of a narrower power over Commerce  with the Indian Tribes.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,297,"As noted above, that omission was not accidental, the Articles of Confederation had contained that Indian affairs language, and that language was twice proposed (and rejected) at the Constitutional Convention. See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.S. at 662, 133 S.Ct. 2552.8 Then, as today, affairs was a broader term than commerce, with affairs more generally referring to things to be done.9 Thus, whatever the precise contours of a freestanding Indian Affairs Clause might have been, the Founders' specific rejection of such a power shows that there is no basis to stretch the Commerce Clause beyond its normal limits.10  3",Thomas,0,
2022-018,298,"Third, the structural principles that the majority points to are only the foreign-affairs powers that the Constitution provides more generally. See Lara, 541 U.S. at 201, 124 S.Ct. 1628 (citing Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 315-322, 57 S.Ct. 216). As detailed above, the Constitution plainly confers foreign-affairs powers on the Federal Government to regulate passports, offenses against the laws of nations, and citizens' acts abroad that threaten the Nation's peace. S. Prakash & M. Ramsey, The Executive Power Over Foreign Affairs, 111 Yale L. J. 231, 298-332 (2001). Those powers were brought to bear on Indian tribes, with whom the Federal Government maintained a government-to-government relationship. See, e.g., Cohen § 1.031, at 25-26, 1 Stat. 470 (passports on Indian lands), at id., at 137 (crimes on Indian lands), id., at 383 (enlisting with foreign states).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,299,"But that authority is a foreign, not domestic, affairs power. It comprehends external relations, like matters of war, peace, and diplomacy—not internal affairs like adoption proceedings. The Court made that point explicit in Curtiss-Wright: The power over external affairs is in origin and essential character different from that over internal affairs. 299 U.S. at 319, 57 S.Ct. 216, see also Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635, n. 2, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring in judgment and opinion of Court) (recognizing this distinction). For external affairs, the Constitution grants the Federal Government a wider authority, but for internal affairs, the Constitution provides fewer, more discrete powers. See, e.g., Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 315, 319, 57 S.Ct. 216, Zivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 34-35, 135 S.Ct. 2076 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,300,"Again, all those limits dovetail with the historical practices of the Founding era. As discussed above, the Founding-era Government undertook a wide array of measures with respect to Indian tribes. But, apart from measures dealing with commerce, most (if not all) of the Federal Government's actions toward Indians either treated them as sovereign entities or regulated citizens on Indian lands who might threaten to breach treaties with Indians or otherwise disrupt the peace.11 For example, early treaties that dealt with questions of peace and war plainly involved some sort of sovereign-to-sovereign relationship. See, e.g., Treaty with the Cherokees (1791), 7 Stat. 39. And the early Trade and Intercourse Acts regulated only the criminal conduct of U. S. citizens on Indian lands.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,301,"This congruence—between the government's actions and the Constitution's enumerated powers—likely reflects the fact that those powers, collectively, responded to the most pressing concerns of the day: that Congress could not enforce its treaties with Indians, police the frontier, or regulate unscrupulous traders—all of which caused violence and raised the specter of war with Indian tribes. As noted, when Congress tried to expand its domain in 1817 to regulate the criminal acts of Indians, one Justice of this Court found it to be a palpable violation of Congress' limited powers. See Bailey, 24 F.Cas., at 938-940. And, all the while, States continued to regulate matters relating to Indians within their territorial limits. The normal federalist dynamic thus extended to the domain of Indian affairs: The Federal Government was supreme with respect to its enumerated powers, but States retained all residual police powers within their territorial borders. See id., at 938-939, McCulloch, 4 Wheat. at 405. And the Federal Government's enumerated powers were not unlimited, but confined to their plain meaning and limits.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,303,"So where did the idea of a plenary power over Indian affairs come from? As it turns out, little more than ipse dixit. The story begins with loose dicta from Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 8 L.Ed. 25 (1831). In that case, the Cherokee Nation petitioned this Court for an injunction to prevent Georgia from enforcing state laws in Cherokee territory and from seizing Cherokee lands. Id., at 11. The Tribe asserted that Article III both allowed the suit and gave this Court original jurisdiction because the suit was one by a foreign State against the State of Georgia. § 2, cls. 1-2. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall admitted that the Tribe's argument was imposing: The Tribe was a state, as a distinct political society, but it was not a state of the union. 5 Pet. at 16. Nonetheless, the Court refused to hear the case. As Marshall reasoned, Indian tribes were not foreign states in the sense of the constitution, as shown in part by the Commerce Clause's delineation of States, foreign nations, and Indian tribes.12 Ibid. Rather, Marshall reasoned that the Indian tribes occupied a unique status, which he characterized as that of domestic dependent nations whose relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian. Id., at 17.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,304,"Other than this opinion, I have been unable to locate any evidence that the Founders thought of the Federal Government as having a generalized guardianship-type relationship with the Indian tribes—much less one conferring any congressional power over Indian affairs. To the contrary, such a status seems difficult to square with the relationship between the Federal Government and tribes, which at times involved warfare, not trust. See, e.g., Fletcher & Singel 904-907, F. Hutchins, Tribes and the American Constitution 104 (2000). And, if such a general relationship existed, there would seem to be little need for the Federal Government to have ratified specific treaties with tribes calling for federal protection. E.g., Treaty with the Kaskaskia (1803), 7 Stat. 78, Treaty with the Creeks (1790), id., at 35. At bottom, Cherokee Nation's loose dicta cannot support a broader power over Indian affairs.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,305,"Nevertheless, Cherokee Nation's suggestion was picked up decades later in United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886)—the first case to actually apply a broader, unenumerated power over Indian affairs. In Kagama, the Court considered the Major Crimes Act of 1885, which, similar to the 1817 Act held unconstitutional by Justice McLean while riding circuit, regulated crimes on Indian lands committed by Indians, the Major Crimes Act differed from the 1817 Act only in that it extended to crimes committed against other Indians. See § 9, 23 Stat. 385. Similarly to Justice McLean's Bailey opinion, the Court first rejected the idea that the Commerce Clause could support the Act—reasoning that it would be a very strained construction of the clause, that a system of criminal laws for Indians  was authorized by the grant of power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes. Kagama, 118 U.S. at 378-379, 6 S.Ct. 1109.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,306,"But the Court determined that the Major Crimes Act was constitutional nevertheless. As the Court first noted, the Act was confined to the acts of an Indian of some tribe, of a criminal character, committed within the limits of the reservation. Id., at 383, 6 S.Ct. 1109. The Court then cited several cases arising from congressional regulations of Indian lands located within federal territories, noting that Congress had previously punished offenses committed on such lands. See id., at 380, 6 S.Ct. 1109 (citing United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567, 572, 11 L.Ed. 1105 (1846), Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 44, 5 S.Ct. 747, 29 L.Ed. 47 (1885), American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511, 542, 7 L.Ed. 242 (1828)). Next, the Court reasoned that the Act does not interfere with the process of the State courts within the reservation, nor with the operation of State laws upon white people found there. 118 U.S. at 383, 6 S.Ct. 1109. Instead, the Act's effects are confined to the acts of an Indian of some tribe, of a criminal character, committed within the limits of the reservation. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,307,"That sort of language seems to view Indian lands as akin to quasi-federal lands or perhaps external to the Nation's normal affairs. But nothing the Court cited actually supported such a view. For example, the fact that the Federal Government could regulate Indians on federal territories does not justify such regulations for Indians within a State's limits. Nor does the fact that tribes were external at the Founding mean that they remained external in 1886.13 Nor does the fact that Congress could regulate citizens who went onto Indian lands, see Rogers, 4 How. at 572, mean that Congress automatically has the power to regulate Indians on those lands.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,308,"But the Court then subtly shifted its approach. Drawing on Cherokee Nation, the Court next asserted that Indian tribes are the wards of the nation. Kagama, 118 U.S. at 383, 6 S.Ct. 1109 (emphasis in original). Because of their very weakness and helplessness, it reasoned, so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal Government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and with it the power. Id., at 384, 6 S.Ct. 1109. This power over the remnants of the Indian tribes, the Court stated, must exist in the federal government, because it never has existed anywhere else, because it has  never been denied, and because it alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes. Id., at 384-385, 6 S.Ct. 1109.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,309,"These pronouncements, however, were pure ipse dixit. The Court pointed to nothing in the text of the Constitution or its original understanding to support them. Nor did the Court give any other real support for those conclusions, instead, it cited three cases, all of which held only that States were restricted in certain ways from governing Indians on Indian lands. Id., at 384, 6 S.Ct. 1109 (citing Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832), Fellows v. Blacksmith, 19 How. 366, 60 U.S. 366, 15 L.Ed. 684 (1856) (only the Federal Government, not private parties, can enforce removal treaties), The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 18 L.Ed. 667 (1867) (States cannot tax Indian lands)). It does not follow from those cases that the Federal Government has any additional authority with regard to Indians—much less a sweeping, unbounded authority over all matters relating to Indians. Cf. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 547 (suggesting that tribes had long been left to regulate their internal affairs). At each step, Kagama thus lacked any constitutional basis.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,310,"Nonetheless, in the years after Kagama, this Court started referring to a plenary power or plenary authority that Congress possessed over Indian tribes, as well as a trust relationship with the Indians. See, e.g., Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445, 478, 19 S.Ct. 722, 43 L.Ed. 1041 (1899), Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 565, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903), Winton v. Amos, 255 U.S. 373, 391, 41 S.Ct. 342, 65 L.Ed. 684 (1921). And, in the decades since, this Court has increasingly gestured to such a plenary power, usually in the context of regulating a tribal government or tribal lands, while conspicuously failing to ground the power in any constitutional text and cautioning that the power is not absolute. See, e.g., ante, at 1629 (noting this problem), United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U.S. 40, 54, 67 S.Ct. 167, 91 L.Ed. 29 (1946) (opinion of Vinson, C. J.), Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56-57, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,311,"The majority's opinion today continues in that vein—only confirming its lack of any constitutional basis. Like so many cases before it, the majority's opinion lurches from one constitutional hook to another, not quite hanging the idea of a plenary power on any of them, while insisting that the plenary power is not absolute. See ante, at 1627-1629. While I empathize with the majority regarding the confusion that Kagama and its progeny have engendered, I cannot reflexively reaffirm a power that remains in search of a constitutional basis. And, while the majority points to a few actual constitutional provisions, like the Commerce and Treaty Clauses, those provisions cannot bear the weight that our cases have placed upon them.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,312,"At bottom, Kagama simply departed from the text and original meaning of the Constitution, which confers only the enumerated powers discussed above. Those powers are not boundless and did not operate differently with respect to Indian tribes at the Founding, instead, they conferred all the authority that the new Federal Government needed at the time to deal with Indian tribes. When dealing with Indian affairs, as with any other affairs, we should always evaluate whether a law can be justified by the Constitution's enumerated powers, rather than pointing to amorphous powers with no textual or historical basis.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,314,"Properly understood, the Constitution's enumerated powers cannot support ICWA. Not one of those powers, as originally  understood, comes anywhere close to including the child custody proceedings of U. S. citizens living within the sole jurisdiction of States. Moreover, ICWA has no constitutional basis even under Kagama and later precedents. While those cases have extended the Federal Government's Indian-related powers beyond the original understanding of the Constitution, this Court has never extended them far enough to support ICWA. Rather, virtually all of this Court's modern Indian-law precedents —upholding laws that regulate tribal lands, tribal governments, and commerce with tribes—can be understood through a core conceptual framework that at least arguably corresponds to Founding-era practices. To extend those cases to uphold ICWA thus would require ignoring the context of those precedents, treating their loose plenary power language as talismanic, and transforming that power into the truly unbounded, absolute power that they disclaim. The basic premise that the powers of the Federal Government are limited and defined should counsel against taking that step.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,316,"ICWA lacks any foothold in the Constitution's original meaning. Most obviously, ICWA has no parallel from the Founding era, it regulates the child custody proceedings of U. S. citizens in state courts—not on Indian lands—merely because the children involved happen to be Indians. No law from that time even came close to asserting a general police power over citizens who happened to be Indians—by, for example, regulating the acts of Indians who were also citizens and who lived within the sole jurisdiction of States (and not on Indian lands). If nothing else, the dearth of Founding-era laws even remotely similar to ICWA should give us pause.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,317,"Nor can ICWA find any support in the Constitution's enumerated powers as originally understood. I take those powers in turn: First, the Property Clause cannot support ICWA because ICWA is not based on the disposition of federal property and is not limited to federal lands, in fact, the Federal Government owns very little Indian land. See Statistical Record of Native North Americans 1054 (M. Reddy ed. 1993), S. Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 1092-1093 (2004).",Thomas,0,
2022-018,318,"Second, the Treaty Clause cannot support ICWA because no one has identified a treaty that governs child custody proceedings —much less a treaty with each of the 574 federally recognized tribes to which ICWA applies. 25 U.S.C. §§ 1903(3), (8), 86 Fed. Reg. 7554 (2021). Nor could they, Congress declared an end to treaty-making with Indian tribes in 1871, and it appears that well over half of the tribes lack any treaty with the Federal Government. See 16 Stat. 566, Brief for Tribal Defendants 37-38, see also generally Vols. 1-2 C. Kappler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties (2d ed. 1902, 1904). And, in part because one Congress can never bind a later Congress, the Federal Government retains the power to abrogate treaties and has done so for at least some Indian treaties. E.g., Lone Wolf, 187 U.S. at 566, 23 S.Ct. 216, accord, La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 423, 460, 20 S.Ct. 168, 44 L.Ed. 223 (1899), 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 90 (1765) (Blackstone). Whatever number of treaties remain in force, they cannot justify ICWA.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,319,"Third, the Commerce Clause cannot support ICWA. As originally understood, the Clause confers a power only over buying and selling, not family law and child custody disputes. Even under our more modern, expansive precedents, the Clause  is still limited to only economic activity and cannot support the regulation of core domestic matters like family or criminal laws. See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 560, 115 S.Ct. 1624, United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 610-611, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 552, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), id., at 657, 132 S.Ct. 2566 (Scalia, J., dissenting).14 And even Kagama itself rejected the Commerce Clause as a basis for any sort of expansive power over Indian affairs. 118 U.S., at 378-379, 6 S.Ct. 1109. Therefore, nothing about that Clause supports a law, like ICWA, governing child custody disputes in state courts.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,320,"Fourth, the Federal Government's foreign-affairs powers cannot support ICWA. For today's purposes, I will assume that some tribes still enjoy the same sort of pre-existing sovereignty and autonomy as tribes at the Founding, thereby establishing the sort of quasi-foreign, government-to-government relationship that appears to have defined those powers at the Founding. Even so, the foreign-affairs powers can operate only externally, in the context of lands under the purview of another sovereign (like Indian tribal lands) or in the context of a government-to-government relationship (such as matters of diplomacy or peace). See Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 315, 319, 57 S.Ct. 216. But regulating child custody proceedings of citizens within a State is the paradigmatic domestic situation, the Federal Government surely could not apply its foreign-affairs powers to the domestic family-law or criminal matters of any other citizens merely because they happened to have citizenship or ancestral connections with another nation.15 Apart from the single provision that allows tribal governments jurisdiction over proceedings for Indians on tribal lands, see § 1911(a), ICWA is completely untethered from any external aspect of our Nation that could somehow implicate these powers.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,321,"That should be the end of the analysis. Again, as the majority notes, our Federal Government has only the powers that the Constitution enumerates. See ante, at 1627-1628, McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405. Not one of those enumerated powers justifies ICWA. Therefore, it has no basis whatsoever in our constitutional system.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,323,"Even taking our plenary power precedents as given (as the majority seems to  do for purposes of these cases), nothing in those precedents supports ICWA. To be sure, this Court has repeatedly used loose language concerning a plenary power and trust relationship with Indians, and that language has been taken by some to displace the normal constitutional rules. See ante, at 1627-1630. But, even taken to their new limits, the Court's precedents have upheld only a variety of laws that either regulate commerce with Indians or deal with Indian tribes and their lands. Despite citing a veritable avalanche of precedents, respondents have failed to identify a single case where this Court upheld a federal statute comparable to ICWA.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,324,"As noted above, Kagama was careful to note that the Major Crimes Act at issue was confined to the acts of an Indian of some tribe, of a criminal character, committed within the limits of the reservation. 118 U.S. at 383, 6 S.Ct. 1109. In that vein, the opinion cited cases arising from congressional regulations of Indian lands located within Federal Territories. See id., at 380, 6 S.Ct. 1109 (citing Rogers, 4 How. at 572, citing Murphy, 114 U.S. at 44, and 356, 5 S.Ct. 747 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. at 542). In other words, it is possible that Kagama viewed Congress as having the power to regulate crimes by Indians on Indian lands because those lands remained in a sense external to the Nation's normal affairs and akin to quasi-federal lands.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,325,"Again, that would be a non sequitur. Nevertheless, at a high level, it is possible to see how Kagama was rooted in the same foreign-affairs and territorial powers that authorized much of the early Trade and Intercourse Acts (and which Congress may have relied upon when passing the 1817 Act). See Cohen § 5.014, at 390, and nn. 47, 48 (linking Kagama with Curtiss-Wright, 299 U.S. at 318, 57 S.Ct. 216), United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978) (describing Indian tribes as possessing a pre-existing sovereignty, apart from the United States). And, viewed in that light, it would make sense to limit Kagama to that conceptual root, treating regulations of tribal lands and tribal governments as external to the normal affairs of the Nation.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,326,"Indeed, such a line explains almost all of the myriad cases that respondents have cataloged as showing an unqualified power over Indian affairs. See, e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 789, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014) (tribal government's sovereign immunity), Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 294, 299, 308, 23 S.Ct. 115, 47 L.Ed. 183 (1902) (federal approval of mining leases on tribal lands), Stephens, 174 U.S. at 476-477, 19 S.Ct. 722 (federal court in Indian territory). Many, for example, dealt with federal laws that purported to diminish a tribe's territory or jurisdiction. South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. 329, 118 S.Ct. 789, 139 L.Ed.2d 773 (1998), Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99, 113 S.Ct. 1119, 122 L.Ed.2d 457 (1993), Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979), United States v. Hellard, 322 U.S. 363, 64 S.Ct. 985, 88 L.Ed. 1326 (1944). Others dealt with state taxes on Indian lands. See, e.g., Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 109 S.Ct. 1698, 104 L.Ed.2d 209 (1989), Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373, 96 S.Ct. 2102, 48 L.Ed.2d 710 (1976), Board of County Comm'rs v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705, 63 S.Ct. 920, 87 L.Ed. 1094 (1943), Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 32 S.Ct. 565, 56 L.Ed. 941 (1912). Others still have permitted the Federal Government to diminish a tribe's self-government. See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56-57, 98 S.Ct. 1670. And yet others, in Kagama's direct lineage, dealt with crimes on Indian lands. See, e.g., Lara, 541 U.S. at 200, 124  S.Ct. 1628, see also, e.g., United States v. Cooley, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1638, 1641-1642, 210 L.Ed.2d 1 (2021), Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 323-324, 98 S.Ct. 1079.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,327,"In doing so, some of those criminal law cases reasoned that the Double Jeopardy Clause permits separate punishments by tribal governments and the Federal Government because of the tribe's separate sovereignty, underscoring Kagama's conceptual root. See, e.g., Cooley, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1641-1642, Lara, 541 U.S. at 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628. And, along the way, at least some of these cases clarified, like Kagama, that they dealt not with Indians who have left or never inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal self-government, but only with Indians residing on Indian lands. McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 167-168, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973), accord, Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U.S. 382, 383, 96 S.Ct. 943, 47 L.Ed.2d 106 (1976) (per curiam) (dealing with an adoption proceeding in which all parties are members of the Tribe and residents of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation), United States v. Algoma Lumber Co., 305 U.S. 415, 417, 59 S.Ct. 267, 83 L.Ed. 260 (1939) (regulations of contracts for the sale of timber on land of the Klamath Indian Reservation). In case after case, the law at issue purported to reach only tribal governments or tribal lands, no more.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,328,"To be sure, applying Kagama's conceptual framework ultimately reveals a catch-22 of sorts: If Congress regulates tribal governments as a matter of external affairs, then such regulation seems to undercut the very tribal sovereignty that serves as the basis for that congressional power. See Lara, 541 U.S. at 214-215, 124 S.Ct. 1628 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). But that appears to be a hallmark of Kagama and its progeny, not a peculiarity. As Chief Justice Marshall once stated, Indians are neither wholly foreign nor wholly domestic, but are instead domestic dependent nations, akin to `tributary' states. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 561, Cherokee Nation, 5 Pet. at 16-17. It may be that this contradiction is simply baked into our Indian jurisprudence. And, in any event, recognizing the proper conceptual root for these precedents makes the most sense of them as a textual and original matter—and it is surely preferable to continuing along this meandering and ill-defined path.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,329,"Yet, even confining Kagama's conceptual error to its roots, the majority seems concerned that other precedents suggest that the Commerce Clause has broader application with respect to Indian affairs. But many of this Court's precedents, even when referring to some broader power, dealt with laws that governed trade with Indians, no more. See, e.g., United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 18 L.Ed. 182 (1866) (selling liquor to Indians), Perrin v. United States, 232 U.S. 478, 34 S.Ct. 387, 58 L.Ed. 691 (1914) (same), United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, 34 S.Ct. 1, 58 L.Ed. 107 (1913) (same), Dick v. United States, 208 U.S. 340, 28 S.Ct. 399, 52 L.Ed. 520 (1908) (selling liquor on Indian lands). Thus, even if those cases suggest a broader power, they must be taken in context. And the cases that the majority cites for its proposition turn out to be the ones that do so in the most obvious dicta. For example, Cotton Petroleum considered state taxes on Indian lands, it had no need to opine on the Commerce Clause beyond explaining that Indian tribes are not States. See 490 U.S. at 192, 109 S.Ct. 1698. In a similar vein, Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), held only that the Commerce Clause does not confer any authority  to abrogate state sovereign immunity, any language about the breadth of the Indian Commerce Clause was wholly unnecessary to that result. Id., at 62, 116 S.Ct. 1114. Shorn of their dicta, all of these precedents reflect only the longstanding— and enumerated—authority to regulate commerce with Indian tribes.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,330,"Other precedents cited by the majority that do not fit into Kagama's conceptual framework are easily explicable as supported by other, specific powers of Congress. For example, Lone Wolf held that Congress can enact laws that violate treaties with Indians, that holding was justified by Congress' general power to abrogate an existing law or treaty. 187 U.S. at 565-566, 23 S.Ct. 216, accord, La Abra Silver Mining Co., 175 U.S. at 460, 20 S.Ct. 168, Blackstone 90. Another treaty-based case, Delaware Tribal Business Comm. v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73, 97 S.Ct. 911, 51 L.Ed.2d 173 (1977), involved the disposition of funds paid pursuant to a treaty. It therefore makes sense as a matter of both the Property and Treaty Clauses. And yet another treaty-based case involved a promise by the United States to establish a discrete trust fund with $500,000 for a Tribe, with annual interest to be paid to the Tribe. See Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 293-294, 62 S.Ct. 1049, 86 L.Ed. 1480 (1942). Though that case spoke of historic trust obligations, it arose from an explicit promise to create a trust with $500,000.16 There is little reason to view such cases as expanding Congress' powers.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,331,"Accordingly, the context of all these cases points to lines that are at least plausibly rooted in Founding-era practices and the text of the Constitution. See Brown v. Davenport, 596 U. S. ___, ___-___, 142 S.Ct. 1510, 1527-1529, 212 L.Ed.2d 463 (2022) (judicial opinions must be taken in context, not read like statutes). Congress can regulate commerce with Indian tribes, it may be able to regulate tribal governments and lands in Kagama's vein, and it can make treaties, dispose of federal funds, and establish discrete trusts.17",Thomas,0,
2022-018,332,"ICWA does not remotely resemble those practices. It does not regulate commerce, tribal governments, or tribal lands. Nor is it based on treaties, federal funds, or any discrete trust. By regulating family-law  matters of citizens living within the sole jurisdiction of States merely because they happen to be Indians, ICWA stands clearly outside the framework of our Indian-law precedents. To uphold ICWA therefore would drastically expand the context in which we have previously upheld Indian-related laws in Kagama's framework.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,333,"But, even if that is so, the majority appears to ask why Congress's power is limited to these scenarios. Ante, at 1631, n. 4. The majority nearly answers itself: because our Constitution is one of enumerated powers, and limiting Congress' authority to those buckets would bring our jurisprudence closer to the powers enumerated by the text and original meaning of the Constitution. See ante, at 1627-1628, 1629-1630, 1631, n. 4. While I share the majority's frustration with petitioners' limited engagement with the Court's precedents, I would recognize the contexts of those cases and limit the so-called plenary power to those contexts. Such limits would at least start us on the road back to the Constitution's original meaning in the area of Indian law.* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-018,334,"The Constitution confers enumerated powers on the Federal Government. Not one of them supports ICWA. Nor does precedent. To the contrary, this Court has never upheld a federal statute that regulates the noncommercial activities of a U. S. citizen residing on lands under the sole jurisdiction of States merely because he happens to be an Indian. But that is exactly what ICWA does: It regulates child custody proceedings, brought in state courts, for those who need never have set foot on Indian lands. It is not about tribal lands or tribal governments, commerce, treaties, or federal property. It therefore fails equally under the Court's precedents as it fails under the plain text and original meaning of the Constitution.",Thomas,0,
2022-018,335,"If there is one saving grace to today's decision, it is that the majority holds only that Texas has failed to demonstrate that ICWA is unconstitutional. See ante, at 1630, 1631. It declines to disturb the Fifth Circuit's conclusion that ICWA is consistent with Article I, but without deciding that ICWA is, in fact, consistent with Article I. But, given ICWA's patent intrusion into the normal domain of state government and clear departure from the Federal Government's enumerated powers, I would hold that Congress lacked any authority to enact ICWA.",Thomas,0,

2022-018,337,"Justice ALITO, dissenting.",Alito,0,
2022-018,338,"The first line in the Court's opinion identifies what is most important about these cases: they are about children who are among the most vulnerable. Ante, at 1622. But after that opening nod, the Court loses sight of this overriding concern and decides one question after another in a way that disserves the rights and interests of these children and their parents, as well as our Constitution's division of federal and state authority.",Alito,0,
2022-018,339,"Decisions about child custody, foster care, and adoption are core state functions. The paramount concern in these cases has long been the best interests of the children involved. See, e.g., 3 T. Zeller, Family Law and Practice §§ 32.06, 32.08 (2022), 6 id., § 64.06. But in many cases, provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) compel actions that conflict with this fundamental state policy, subordinating what family-court judges—and often biological parents—determine to be in the best interest of a child to what Congress believed is in the best interest of a tribe.",Alito,0,
2022-018,340,"The cases involved in this litigation illustrate the distressing consequences. To its credit, the Court acknowledges what happened  to these children, but its decision does nothing to prevent the repetition of similar events. Take A. L. M. His adoption by a loving non-Indian couple, with whom he had lived for over a year and had developed a strong emotional bond, was initially blocked even though it was supported by both of his biological parents, his grandmother, and the testimony of both his court-appointed guardian and a psychological expert. Because a Tribe objected, he would have been sent to an Indian couple that he did not know in another State had the non-Indian couple not sought and obtained an emergency judicial order.",Alito,0,
2022-018,341,"Baby O.'s story is similar. A non-Indian couple welcomed Baby O. into their home when she was three days old and cared for her for more than two years while seeking to adopt her. The couple ensured that Baby O.'s serious medical needs were met and maintained regular visits with Baby O.'s biological mother so that Baby O. could have a continuing relationship with her biological family. Even though both biological parents supported the couple's adoption of Baby O., a Tribe objected and sought to send Baby O. to live in foster care on a reservation in another State. Only after the couple joined this lawsuit did the Tribe agree to a settlement that would permit the couple to finalize the adoption.",Alito,0,
2022-018,342,"After nearly two years moving between foster-care placements, Child P., whose maternal grandmother is a member of an Indian Tribe, was placed with a non-Indian couple who provided her a stable home. After the placement, the Tribe, which had told the state court years earlier that Child P. was not eligible for tribal membership, reversed its position without explanation and enrolled her as a member. The Tribe then objected to the couple's efforts to adopt Child P., even though her court-appointed guardian believed that the adoption was in Child P.'s best interest. To comply with the ICWA, the state court removed Child P. from the couple's custody and placed her with her maternal grandmother, who had lost her foster license due to a criminal conviction. Ante, at 1626 (majority opinion).",Alito,0,
2022-018,343,"Does the Constitution give Congress the authority to bring about such results? I would hold that it does not. Whatever authority Congress possesses in the area of Indian affairs, it does not have the power to sacrifice the best interests of vulnerable children to promote the interests of tribes in maintaining membership. Nor does Congress have the power to force state judges to disserve the best interests of children or the power to delegate to tribes the authority to force those judges to abide by the tribes' priorities regarding adoption and foster-care placement.",Alito,0,
2022-018,345,"The Court makes a valiant effort to bring coherence to what has been said in past cases about Congress's power in this area, but its attempt falls short. At the end of a lengthy discussion, the majority distills only this nugget: Congress's power over Indian affairs is plenary but not absolute. Ante, at 1629-1630. The majority in today's cases did not coin this formulation, it merely repeats what earlier cases have said. See, e.g., Delaware Tribal Business Comm. v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73, 84, 97 S.Ct. 911, 51 L.Ed.2d 173 (1977) (quoting United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U.S. 40, 54, 67 S.Ct. 167, 91 L.Ed. 29 (1946) (plurality opinion)). But the formulation's pedigree cannot make up for its vacuity. The term plenary is defined in one dictionary after another as absolute. See, e.g., New Oxford American Dictionary 1343 (3d ed. 2010), Webster's Third New International Dictionary  1739 (2002), The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1486 (2d ed. 1987). If we accept these definitions, what the Court says is that absolute # absolute and plenary # plenary, violating one of the most basic laws of logic. Surely we can do better than that.",Alito,0,
2022-018,346,"We need not map the outer bounds of Congress's Indian affairs authority to hold that the challenged provisions of ICWA lie outside it. We need only acknowledge that even so-called plenary powers cannot override foundational constitutional constraints. By attempting to control state judicial proceedings in a field long-recognized to be the virtually exclusive province of the States, ICWA violates the fundamental structure of our constitutional order.",Alito,0,
2022-018,347,"In reaching this conclusion, I do not question the proposition that Congress has broad power to regulate Indian affairs. We have consistently described Congress's powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes as `plenary and exclusive.' United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004) (collecting cases). Reflecting this understanding, we have sanctioned a wide range of enactments that bear on Indian tribes and their members, sometimes (regrettably) without tracing the source of Congress's authority to a particular enumerated power. See, e.g., Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56-58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978) (modifying tribal governments' powers of self-government), Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 565-566, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903) (transferring tribal land). Nor do I dispute the notion that Congress has undertaken responsibilities that have been roughly analogized to those of a trustee. In exercising its constitutionally-granted powers, the Federal Government, following `a humane and self imposed policy,' has committed itself to `moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust' to the Indian people. United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 176, 131 S.Ct. 2313, 180 L.Ed.2d 187 (2011).1",Alito,0,
2022-018,348,"Nevertheless, we have repeatedly cautioned that Congress's Indian affairs power is not unbounded. And while we have articulated few limits, we have acknowledged what should be one obvious constraint: Congress's authority to regulate Indian affairs is limited by other pertinent constitutional restrictions that circumscribe the legislative power. United States v. Creek Nation, 295 U.S. 103, 109-110, 55 S.Ct. 681, 79 L.Ed. 1331 (1935), see also New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (Congress exercises its conferred powers subject to the limitations contained in the Constitution).",Alito,0,
2022-018,349,"For example, in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), we held that Congress's power under the Indian Commerce Clause was limited by the background principle of state sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment. Id., at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114. We rejected the Tribe's argument that Congress's Indian affairs power could exceed other constitutional restrictions when necessary to `protect the tribes' from state interference. Id., at 60, 116 S.Ct. 1114. Foundational constitutional principles like state  sovereign immunity, we observed, are not so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the suit is in an area, like the regulation of Indian commerce, that is under the exclusive control of the Federal Government. Id., at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114. Even when we have sustained legislation, we have cautioned against congressional overreach. See Lara, 541 U.S. at 203-205, 124 S.Ct. 1628. We have suggested that a law may exceed Congress's power to regulate Indian affairs if it has an unusual legislative objective, brings about radical changes in tribal status, or interferes with the power or authority of any State. Ibid.",Alito,0,
2022-018,350,"We have rarely had occasion to enforce these limits, in part because the enactments before us have often fallen comfortably within the historical bounds of Congress's enumerated powers. See ante, at 1679-1683 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). But that does not mean that we should shy away from enforcement when presented with a statute that exceeds what the Constitution allows.",Alito,0,
2022-018,352,"Congress's power in the area of Indian affairs cannot exceed the limits imposed by the system of dual sovereignty between the States and the Federal Government established by the Constitution. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 457, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991). The powers delegated to the federal government are few and defined, while those which  remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The Federalist No. 45, p. 292 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The powers retained by the States constitute `a residuary and inviolable sovereignty,' secure against federal intrusion. Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 919, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997) (quoting The Federalist No. 39, at 245 (J. Madison)). This structural principle, reinforced in the Tenth Amendment, confirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power to the States. New York, 505 U.S. at 157, 112 S.Ct. 2408. The corollary is also true: in some circumstances, the powers reserved to the States inform the scope of Congress's power. Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1461, 1476, 200 L.Ed.2d 854 (2018). This includes in the area of Indian affairs. Dick v. United States, 208 U.S. 340, 353, 28 S.Ct. 399, 52 L.Ed. 520 (1908) (Congress's primacy over Indian tribes and States' full and complete jurisdiction over all persons and things within their limits are fundamental principles  of equal dignity, and neither must be so enforced as to nullify or substantially impair the other).",Alito,0,
2022-018,353,"While we have never comprehensively enumerated the States' reserved powers, we have long recognized that governance of family relations—including marriage relationships and child custody—is among them. It is not merely that these matters have traditionally been governed by state law or that the responsibility over them remains primarily with the States, ante, at 1629 (majority opinion), but that the field of domestic relations has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975) (emphasis added). The whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States, and not to the laws of the United States. In re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-594, 10 S.Ct. 850, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890). Cases decided by this Court over a period of more than a century bear witness to this historical fact. Sosna, 419 U.S. at 404, 95 S.Ct. 553. See, e.g., United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 766, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 186 L.Ed.2d 808 (2013), McCarty v.",Alito,0,

2022-018,355,"This does not mean that federal law may never touch on family matters. As the majority observes, ante, at 1629-1630, we have held that federal legislation that regulates certain economic aspects of domestic relations can preempt conflicting state law. Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U.S. 46, 55-56, 102 S.Ct. 49, 70 L.Ed.2d 39 (1981) (providing an order of precedence for beneficiaries of a service member's life insurance policy), see, e.g., Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.S. 483, 485-486, 133 S.Ct. 1943, 186 L.Ed.2d 43 (2013) (allocating federal death benefits), McCarty, 453 U.S. at 211, 235-236, 101 S.Ct. 2728 (allocating military retirement pay). But we have never held that Congress under any of its enumerated powers may regulate the very nature of those relations or dictate their creation, dissolution, or modification. Nor could we and remain faithful to our founding. No one denies that the States, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed full power over ordinary family relations, and the Constitution delegated no authority to the Government of the United States in this area. Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U.S. 562, 575, 26 S.Ct. 525, 50 L.Ed. 867 (1906). It is a most important aspect of our federalism that the domestic relations of husband and wife—and parent and child—are matters reserved to the States and do not belong to the United States. Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S. 226, 233, 65 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed. 1577 (1945) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).",Alito,0,
2022-018,356,"As part of that reserved power, state courts have resolved child custody matters arising among state citizens since the earliest days of the Nation. See, e.g., Nickols v. Giles, 2 Root 461, 461-462 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1796) (declining to remove daughter from mother's care), Wright v. Wright, 2 Mass. 109, 110-111 (1806) (awarding custody of child to mother following divorce), Commonwealth v. Nutt, 1 Browne 143, 145 (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas 1810) (assigning custody of child to her sister). Then, as now, state courts' overriding concern was the best interests of the children. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Addicks, 5 Binn. 520, 521 (Pa. 1813) (court's anxiety is principally directed to the child's welfare), In re Waldron, 13 Johns. Cas. 418, 421 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1816) (court is principally to be directed by the benefit and the welfare of the child). By the mid-19th century, States had begun enacting statutory adoption schemes, enforceable through state courts, to provide for the welfare of dependent children, starting with Massachusetts in 1851. S. Presser, The Historical Background of the American Law of Adoption, 11 J. Fam. L. 443, 453, 465 (1971) (Presser), 1851 Mass. Acts ch. 324. Over the next 25 years, 23 other States followed suit. Presser 465-466, and nn. 111, 112. As the cases before us attest, this historic tradition of state oversight of child custody and welfare through state judicial proceedings continues to the present day.",Alito,0,
2022-018,357,"The ICWA provisions challenged here do not simply run up against this traditional state authority, they run roughshod over it when the State seeks to protect one of its young citizens who also happens to be a member of an Indian tribe or who is the biological child of a member and eligible for tribal membership, herself. 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4). In those circumstances, ICWA requires a State to abandon the carefully-considered judicial procedures and standards it has established to provide for a child's welfare and instead apply a scheme devised by Congress that focuses not solely on the best interest of the child, but also on the stability and security of Indian  tribes. § 1902. That scheme requires States to invite tribal authorities with no existing relationship to a child to intervene in judicial custody proceedings, §§ 1911(c), 1912(a), 1914. It requires States to replace their reasoned standards for termination of parental rights and placement in foster care with standards that favor the interests of an Indian custodian over those of the child. §§ 1912(e), (f). It forces state courts to give Indian couples (even those of different tribes) priority in adoption and foster-care placements, even over a non-Indian couple who would better serve a child's emotional and other needs. §§ 1915(a), (b). And it requires state judges to subordinate the State's typical custodial considerations to a tribe's alternative preference. § 1915(c).",Alito,0,
2022-018,358,"It is worth underscoring that ICWA's directives apply even when the child is not a member of a tribe and has never been involved in tribal life, and even when a child's biological parents object. As seen in the cases before us, the sad consequence is that ICWA's provisions may delay or prevent a child's adoption by a family ready to provide her a permanent home.",Alito,0,
2022-018,359,"ICWA's mandates do not simply touch on family matters. They override States' authority to determine—and implement through their courts—the child custody and welfare policies they deem most appropriate for their citizens. And in doing so, the mandates harm vulnerable children and their parents. In my view, the Constitution cannot countenance this result. The guarantee of dual sovereignty embodied in the constitutional structure is not so ephemeral as to dissipate simply because Congress invoked a so-called plenary power. Seminole Tribe of Fla., 517 U.S. at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114. The challenged ICWA provisions effectively nullify a State's authority to conduct state child custody proceedings in accordance with its own preferred family relations policies, a prerogative that States have exercised for centuries. Dick, 208 U.S. at 353, 28 S.Ct. 399. Congress's Indian affairs power, broad as it is, does not extend that far.2",Alito,0,
2022-018,360,"The indicators we previously identified also signal that ICWA exceeds Congress's constitutional bounds. See Lara, 541 U.S. at 203-205, 124 S.Ct. 1628. First, the law has an unusual legislative objective. Id., at 203, 124 S.Ct. 1628. ICWA's attempt to control local judicial proceedings in a core field of state concern departs significantly from other Indian affairs legislation that we have sanctioned—laws that typically regulated actual commerce, related to tribal lands and governance, or fulfilled treaty obligations. See ante, at 1679-1683 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Second, the law brings about radical changes in tribal status, effectively granting tribes veto power over state judgments regarding the welfare of resident Indian children. Lara, 541 U.S. at 205, 124 S.Ct. 1628. And third, the law interferes with the power and authority of every State in the conduct of state judicial proceedings and determination of child custody arrangements. Ibid.",Alito,0,
2022-018,361,"That is, in fact, its express design. See, e.g., §§ 1911(c), 1912, 1915. These indicators confirm that ICWA surpasses even a generous understanding of Congress's Indian affairs authority.* * *",Alito,0,
2022-018,362,I am sympathetic to the challenges that tribes face in maintaining membership and preserving their cultures. And I do not question the idea that the best interests of children may in some circumstances take into account a desire to enable children to maintain a connection with the culture of their ancestors. The Constitution provides Congress with many means for promoting such interests. But the Constitution does not permit Congress to displace long-exercised state authority over child custody proceedings to advance those interests at the expense of vulnerable children and their families.,Alito,0,

In that suit, she sought an injunction to prevent the State from forcing her to create wedding websites celebrating marriages that defy her beliefs. App. 303-305. To secure relief, Ms. Smith first had to establish her standing to sue. That required her to show a credible threat existed that Colorado would, in fact, seek to compel speech from her that she did not wish to produce. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.

2022-019,43,"Toward that end, Ms. Smith began by directing the court to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA). That law defines a public accommodation broadly to include almost every public-facing business in the State. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-601(1) (2022). In what some call its Accommodation Clause, the law prohibits a public accommodation from denying the full and equal enjoyment of its goods and  services to any customer based on his race, creed, disability, sexual orientation, or other statutorily enumerated trait. § 24-34-601(2)(a). Either state officials or private citizens may bring actions to enforce the law. §§ 24-34-306, 24-34-602(1). And a variety of penalties can follow. Courts can order fines up to $500 per violation. § 24-34-602(1)(a). The Colorado Commission on Civil Rights can issue cease-and-desist orders, § 24-34-306(9), and require violators to take various other affirmative actions. § 24-34-605, § 24-34-306(9). In the past, these have included participation in mandatory educational programs and the submission of ongoing compliance reports to state officials. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v.

Id., at 1172-1175. The court pointed to the fact that Colorado has a history of past enforcement against nearly identical conduct — i.e., Masterpiece Cakeshop, that anyone in the State may file a complaint against Ms. Smith and initiate a potentially burdensome administrative hearing process, and that Colorado has declined to disavow future enforcement proceedings against her. Id., at 1174. Before us, no party challenges these conclusions.",,0,

The court acknowledged that Ms. Smith's planned wedding websites qualify as pure speech protected by the First Amendment. Id., at 1176. As a result, the court reasoned, Colorado had to satisfy strict scrutiny before compelling speech from her that she did not wish to create. Id., at 1178. Under that standard, the court continued, the State had to show both that forcing Ms. Smith to create speech would serve a compelling governmental interest and that no less restrictive alternative exists to secure that interest. Ibid. Ultimately, a divided panel concluded that the State had carried these burdens. As the majority saw it, Colorado has a compelling interest in ensuring equal access to publicly available goods and services, and no option short of coercing speech from Ms. Smith can satisfy that interest because she plans to offer unique services that are, by definition, unavailable elsewhere.

An  end because the freedom to think and speak is among our inalienable human rights. See, e.g., 4 Annals of Cong. 934 (1794) (Rep. Madison). A means because the freedom of thought and speech is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. Whitney, 274 U. S., at 375, 47 S.Ct. 641 (Brandeis, J., concurring). By allowing all views to flourish, the framers understood, we may test and improve our own thinking both as individuals and as a Nation. For all these reasons, if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), it is the principle that the government may not interfere with an uninhibited marketplace of ideas, McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.

If the students refused, the State threatened to expel them and fine or jail their parents. Some families objected on the ground that the State sought to compel their children to express views at odds with their faith as Jehovah's Witnesses. When the dispute arrived here, this Court offered a firm response. In seeking to compel students to salute the flag and recite a pledge, the Court held, state authorities had transcended constitutional limitations on their powers. 319 U.S. at 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178.

Id., at 561-566, 115 S.Ct. 2338. But this Court reversed. Id., at 581, 115 S.Ct. 2338. Whatever state law may demand, this Court explained, the parade was constitutionally protected speech and requiring the veterans to include voices they wished to exclude would impermissibly require them to alter the expressive content of their parade. Id., at 572-573, 115 S.Ct. 2338. The veterans' choice of what to say (and not say) might have been unpopular, but they had a First Amendment right to present their message undiluted by views they did not share.",,0,
2022-019,65,"Then there is Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. In that case, the Boy Scouts excluded James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster, from membership after learning he was gay. Mr. Dale argued that New Jersey's public accommodations law required the Scouts to reinstate him. 530 U.S. at 644-645, 120 S.Ct. 2446. The New Jersey Supreme Court sided with Mr. Dale, id., at 646-647, 120 S.Ct. 2446, but again this Court reversed, id., at 661, 120 S.Ct. 2446. The decision to exclude Mr. Dale may not have implicated pure speech, but this Court held that the Boy Scouts is an expressive association entitled to First Amendment protection. Id., at 656, 120 S.Ct. 2446. And, the Court found, forcing the Scouts to include Mr. Dale would interfere with its choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs. Id., at 654, 120 S.Ct. 2446.",,0,
2022-019,66,"As these cases illustrate, the First Amendment protects an individual's right to speak his mind regardless of whether the government considers his speech sensible and well intentioned or deeply misguided, Hurley, 515 U. S., at 574, 115 S.Ct. 2338, and likely to cause anguish or incalculable grief, Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. 443, 456, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011). Equally, the First Amendment protects acts of expressive association. See, e.g., Dale, 530 U. S., at 647-656, 120 S.Ct. 2446, Hurley, 515 U. S., at 568-570, 579, 115 S.Ct. 2338. Generally, too, the government may not compel a person to speak its own preferred messages. See Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 505-506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), see also, e.g., Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 256, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974), Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 714, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 2361, 2371, 201 L.Ed.2d 835 (2018) (NIFLA). Nor does it matter whether the government seeks to compel a person to speak its message when he would prefer to remain silent or to force an individual to include other ideas with his own speech that he would prefer not to include. See Hurley, 515 U. S., at 568-570, 576, 115 S.Ct. 2338, see also Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 63-64, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006) (FAIR) (discussing cases). All that offends the First Amendment just the same.",,0,
2022-019,68,"Applying these principles to this case, we align ourselves with much of the Tenth Circuit's analysis. The Tenth Circuit held that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create qualify as pure speech under this Court's precedents. 6 F.4th at 1176. We agree. It is a conclusion that flows directly from the parties' stipulations. They have stipulated that Ms. Smith's websites promise to contain images, words, symbols, and other modes of expression. App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a. They have stipulated that every website will be her original, customized creation. Id., at 181a-182a. And they have stipulated that Ms. Smith will create these websites to communicate ideas—namely, to celebrate and promote the couple's wedding and unique love story and to celebrate and promote what Ms. Smith understands to be a true marriage. Id., at 186a-187a.",,0,
2022-019,69,"A hundred years ago, Ms. Smith might have furnished her services using pen and paper. Those services are no less protected speech today because they are conveyed with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 870, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). All manner of speech—from pictures, films, paintings, drawings, and engravings, to oral utterance and the printed word—qualify for the First Amendment's protections, no less can hold true when it comes to speech like Ms. Smith's conveyed over the Internet. Kaplan v. California, 413 U. S. 115, 119-120, 93 S.Ct. 2680, 37 L.Ed.2d 492 (1973), see also Shurtleff v. Boston, 596 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct. 1583, 1590-91, 212 L.Ed.2d 621 (2022) (flags), Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U. S. 786, 790, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011) (video games), Hurley, 515 U. S., at 568-570, 115 S.Ct. 2338 (parades), Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 790, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (music), Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S. 495, 501-502, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952) (movies).",,0,
2022-019,70,"We further agree with the Tenth Circuit that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create involve her speech. 6 F.4th at 1181, and n. 5. Again, the parties' stipulations lead the way to that conclusion. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a, 187a. As the parties have described it, Ms. Smith intends to vet each prospective project to determine whether it is one she is willing to endorse. Id., at 185a. She will consult with clients to discuss their unique stories as source material. Id., at 186a. And she will produce a final story for each couple using her own words and her own original artwork. Id., at 182a-183a. Of course, Ms. Smith's speech may combine with the couple's in the final product. But for purposes of the First Amendment that changes nothing. An individual does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices in a single communication. Hurley, 515 U. S., at 569, 115 S.Ct. 2338.",,0,
2022-019,71,"As surely as Ms. Smith seeks to engage in protected First Amendment speech, Colorado seeks to compel speech Ms. Smith does not wish to provide. As the Tenth Circuit observed, if Ms. Smith offers wedding websites celebrating marriages she endorses, the State intends to force her to create custom websites celebrating other marriages she does not. 6 F.4th at 1178. Colorado seeks to compel this speech in order to excise certain ideas or viewpoints from the public dialogue. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 642, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). Indeed, the Tenth Circuit recognized that the coercive elimination of dissenting ideas about marriage constitutes Colorado's very purpose in seeking to apply its law to Ms. Smith. 6 F.4th at 1178.",,0,
2022-019,72,"We part ways with the Tenth Circuit only when it comes to the legal conclusions that follow. While that court thought Colorado could compel speech from Ms. Smith consistent with the Constitution, our First Amendment precedents laid out above teach otherwise. In Hurley, the Court found that Massachusetts impermissibly compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment when it sought to force parade organizers to accept participants who would affect their message. 515 U.S. at 572, 115 S.Ct. 2338. In Dale, the Court held that New Jersey intruded on the Boy Scouts' First Amendment rights when it tried to require the group to propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs by directing its membership choices. 530 U.S. at 654, 120 S.Ct. 2446. And in Barnette, this Court found impermissible coercion when West Virginia required schoolchildren to recite a pledge that contravened their convictions on threat of punishment or expulsion. 319 U.S. at 626-629, 63 S.Ct. 1178. Here, Colorado seeks to put Ms. Smith to a similar choice: If she wishes to speak, she must either speak as the State demands or face sanctions for expressing her own beliefs, sanctions that may include compulsory participation in remedial  training, filing periodic compliance reports as officials deem necessary, and paying monetary fines. App. 120, supra, at 2308-2309. Under our precedents, that is enough, more than enough, to represent an impermissible abridgment of the First Amendment's right to speak freely. Hurley, 515 U. S., at 574, 115 S.Ct. 2338.",,0,
2022-019,73,"Consider what a contrary approach would mean. Under Colorado's logic, the government may compel anyone who speaks for pay on a given topic to accept all commissions on that same topic —no matter the underlying message—if the topic somehow implicates a customer's statutorily protected trait. 6 F.4th at 1198 (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting). Taken seriously, that principle would allow the government to force all manner of artists,  speechwriters, and others whose services involve speech to speak what they do not believe on pain of penalty. The government could require an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a film with a Zionist message, or an atheist muralist to accept a commission celebrating Evangelical zeal, so long as they would make films or murals for other members of the public with different messages. Id., at 1199. Equally, the government could force a male website designer married to another man to design websites for an organization that advocates against same-sex marriage. See Brief for Petitioners 26-27. Countless other creative professionals, too, could be forced to choose between remaining silent, producing speech that violates their beliefs, or speaking their minds and incurring sanctions for doing so. See, e.g., Brief for Creative Professionals et al. as Amici Curiae 5-10, Brief for First Amendment Scholars as Amici Curiae 19-22. As our precedents recognize, the First Amendment tolerates none of that.",,0,
2022-019,74,"In saying this much, we do not question the vital role public accommodations laws play in realizing the civil rights of all Americans. This Court has recognized that governments in this country have a compelling interest in eliminating discrimination in places of public accommodation. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 628, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984), see also Hurley, 515 U. S., at 571-572, 115 S.Ct. 2338. This Court has recognized, too, that public accommodations laws vindicate the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to public establishments. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 250, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964) (internal quotation marks omitted), see also, e.g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964), Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) (per curiam).",,0,
2022-019,75,"Over time, governments in this country have expanded public accommodations laws in notable ways too. Statutes like Colorado's grow from nondiscrimination rules the common law sometimes imposed on common carriers and places of traditional public accommodation like hotels and restaurants. Dale, 530 U. S., at 656-657, 120 S.Ct. 2446. Often, these enterprises exercised something like monopoly power or hosted or transported others or their belongings much like bailees. See, e.g., Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397, 437, 9 S.Ct. 469, 32 L.Ed. 788 (1889), Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 154 U. S. 1, 14, 14 S.Ct. 1098, 38 L.Ed. 883 (1894). Over time, some States, Colorado included, have expanded the reach of these nondiscrimination rules to cover virtually every place of business engaged in any sales to the public. Compare 1885 Colo. Sess. Laws pp. 132-133 (a short list of entities originally bound by the State's public accommodations law) with Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-601(1) (currently defining a public accommodation to include any place of business engaged in any sales to the public).",,0,
2022-019,76,"Importantly, States have also expanded their laws to prohibit more forms of discrimination. Today, for example, approximately half the States have laws like Colorado's that expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.2  And, as we have recognized, this is entirely unexceptional. Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct. at 1728. States may protect gay persons, just as they can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment. Ibid., see also Hurley, 515 U. S., at 571-572, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 6 F.4th at 1203 (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting). Consistent with all of this, Ms. Smith herself recognizes that Colorado and other States are generally free to apply their public accommodations laws, including their provisions protecting gay persons, to a vast array of businesses. Reply Brief 15, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46.",,0,
2022-019,77,"At the same time, this Court has also recognized that no public accommodations law is immune from the demands of the Constitution. In particular, this Court has held, public accommodations statutes can sweep too broadly when deployed to compel speech. In Hurley, the Court commented favorably on Massachusetts' public accommodations law, but made plain it could not be applied to expressive activity to compel speech. 515 U. S. at 571, 578, 115 S.Ct. 2338. In Dale, the Court observed that New Jersey's public accommodations law had many lawful applications but held that it could not justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts' rights to freedom of expressive association. 530 U.S. at 659, 120 S.Ct. 2446. And, once more, what was true in those cases must hold true here. When a state public accommodations law and the Constitution collide, there can be no question which must prevail. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.",,0,
2022-019,78,"Nor is it any answer, as the Tenth Circuit seemed to suppose, that Ms. Smith's services are unique. 6 F.4th at 1180. In some sense, of course, her voice is unique, so is everyone's. But that hardly means a State may coopt an individual's voice for its own purposes. In Hurley, the veterans had an enviable outlet for speech, after all, their parade was a notable and singular event. 515 U. S. at 560, 577-578, 115 S.Ct. 2338. In Dale, the Boy Scouts offered what some might consider a unique experience. 530 U.S. at 649-650, 120 S.Ct. 2446. But in both cases this Court held that the State could not use its public accommodations statute to deny speakers the right to choose the content of their own messages. Hurley, 515 U. S., at 573, 115 S.Ct. 2338, see Dale, 530 U. S., at 650-656, 120 S.Ct. 2446. Were the rule otherwise, the better the artist, the finer the writer, the more unique his talent, the more easily his voice could be conscripted to disseminate the government's preferred messages. That would not respect the First Amendment, more nearly, it would spell its demise.",,0,
2022-019,80,"Before us, Colorado appears to distance itself from the Tenth Circuit's reasoning. Now, the State seems to acknowledge that the First Amendment does forbid it from  coercing Ms. Smith to create websites endorsing same-sex marriage or expressing any other message with which she disagrees. See Brief for Respondents 12 (disclaiming any interest in interfering with Ms. Smith's choice to offer only websites of her own design), see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19 (conceding that constitutional concerns would arise if Colorado required petitioner to design a website that she would not create or convey for any client). Instead, Colorado devotes most of its efforts to advancing an alternative theory for affirmance.",,0,
2022-019,81,"The State's alternative theory runs this way. To comply with Colorado law, the State says, all Ms. Smith must do is repurpose websites she will create to celebrate marriages she does endorse for marriages she does not. She sells a product to some, the State reasons, so she must sell the same product to all. Brief for Respondents 15, 20. At bottom, Colorado's theory rests on a belief that the Tenth Circuit erred at the outset when it said this case implicates pure speech. Id., at 19. Instead, Colorado says, this case involves only the sale of an ordinary commercial product and any burden on Ms. Smith's speech is purely incidental. Id., at 18, 25-28, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 65, 97-98. On the State's telling, then, speech more or less vanishes from the picture—and, with it, any need for First Amendment scrutiny. In places, the dissent seems to advance the same line of argument. Post, at 2337-2338 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).",,0,
2022-019,82,"This alternative theory, however, is difficult to square with the parties' stipulations. As we have seen, the State has stipulated that Ms. Smith does not seek to sell an ordinary commercial good but intends to create customized and tailored speech for each couple. App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a, 187a. The State has stipulated that each website 303 Creative designs and creates is an original, customized creation for each client. Id., at 181a. The State has stipulated, too, that Ms. Smith's wedding websites will be expressive in nature, using text, graphics, and in some cases videos to celebrate and promote the couple's wedding and unique love story. Id., at 187a. As the case comes to us, then, Colorado seeks to compel just the sort of speech that it tacitly concedes lies beyond the reach of its powers.",,0,
2022-019,83,"Of course, as the State emphasizes, Ms. Smith offers her speech for pay and does so through 303 Creative LLC, a company in which she is the sole member-owner. Id., at 181a, see also post, at 2339-2340 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (emphasizing Ms. Smith's commercial activity). But none of that makes a difference. Does anyone think a speechwriter loses his First Amendment right to choose for whom he works if he accepts money in return? Or that a visual artist who accepts commissions from the public does the same? Many of the world's great works of literature and art were created with an expectation of compensation. Nor, this Court has held, do speakers shed their First Amendment protections by employing the corporate form to disseminate their speech. This fact underlies our cases involving everything from movie producers to book publishers to newspapers. See, e.g., Joseph Burstyn, Inc., 343 U. S., at 497-503, 72 S.Ct. 777, Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 114-116, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991), Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 240-241, 249, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936).",,0,
2022-019,84,"Colorado next urges us to focus on the reason Ms. Smith refuses to offer the speech it seeks to compel. She refuses, the State insists, because she objects to the protected characteristics of  certain customers. Brief for Respondents 16, see also post, at 2335-2337, 2338 2339 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (reciting the same argument). But once more, the parties' stipulations speak differently. The parties agree that Ms. Smith will gladly create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, or bisexual clients or for organizations run by gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons so long as the custom graphics and websites do not violate her beliefs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. That is a condition, the parties acknowledge, Ms. Smith applies to all customers. Ibid. Ms. Smith stresses, too, that she has not and will not create expressions that defy any of her beliefs for any customer, whether that involves encouraging violence, demeaning another person, or promoting views inconsistent with her religious commitments. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-20. Nor, in any event, do the First Amendment's protections belong only to speakers whose motives the government finds worthy, its protections belong to all, including to speakers whose motives others may find misinformed or offensive. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 468-469, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (observing that a speaker's motivation is entirely irrelevant (internal quotation marks omitted)), National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43, 43-44, 97 S.Ct. 2205, 53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977) (per curiam) (upholding free-speech rights of participants in a Nazi parade), Snyder, 562 U. S., at 456-457, 131 S.Ct. 1207 (same for protestors of a soldier's funeral).3",,0,
2022-019,85,"Failing all else, Colorado suggests that this Court's decision in FAIR supports affirmance. See also post, at 2335-2336 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (making the same argument). In FAIR, a group of schools challenged a law requiring them, as a condition of accepting federal funds, to permit military recruiters space on campus on equal terms with other potential employers. 547 U. S. at 51-52, 58, 126 S.Ct. 1297. The only expressive activity required of the law schools, the Court found, involved the posting of logistical notices along these lines: `The U. S. Army recruiter will meet interested students in Room 123 at 11 a.m.' Id., at 61-62, 126 S.Ct. 1297. And, the Court reasoned, compelled speech of this sort was incidental and a far cry from the speech at issue in our leading First Amendment precedents that have established the principle that freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say. Ibid., see also NIFLA, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct. at 2371.",,0,
2022-019,86,"It is a far cry from this case too. To be sure, our cases have held that the government may sometimes require the dissemination of purely factual and uncontroversial information, particularly  in the context of commercial advertising. Hurley, 515 U. S., at 573, 115 S.Ct. 2338 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also NIFLA, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct. at 2373, Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 795-796, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988). But this case involves nothing like that. Here, Colorado does not seek to impose an incidental burden on speech. It seeks to force an individual to utter what is not in her mind about a question of political and religious significance. Barnette, 319 U. S., at 634, 63 S.Ct. 1178. And that, FAIR reaffirmed, is something the First Amendment does not tolerate. No government, FAIR recognized, may affect a speaker's message by forcing her to accommodate other views, 547 U.S. at 63, 126 S.Ct. 1297, no government may `alter' the `expressive content' of her message, id., at 63-64, 126 S.Ct. 1297 (alteration omitted), and no government may interfere with her desired message, id., at 64, 126 S.Ct. 1297.",,0,
2022-019,88,"It is difficult to read the dissent and conclude we are looking at the same case. Much of it focuses on the evolution of public accommodations laws, post, at 2325-2329, and the strides gay Americans have made towards securing equal justice under law, post, at 2329-2331. And, no doubt, there is much to applaud here. But none of this answers the question we face today: Can a State force someone who provides her own expressive services to abandon her conscience and speak its preferred message instead?",,0,
2022-019,89,"When the dissent finally gets around to that question—more than halfway into its opinion—it reimagines the facts of this case from top to bottom. The dissent claims that Colorado wishes to regulate Ms. Smith's conduct, not her speech. Post, at 2334-2338. Forget Colorado's stipulation that Ms. Smith's activities are expressive, App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a, and the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that the State seeks to compel pure speech, 6 F.4th at 1176. The dissent chides us for deciding a pre-enforcement challenge. Post, at 2334. But it ignores the Tenth Circuit's finding that Ms. Smith faces a credible threat of sanctions unless she conforms her views to the State's. 6 F.4th at 1172-1175. The dissent suggests (over and over again) that any burden on speech here is incidental. Post, at 2334-2335, 2335-2338, 2339-2340. All despite the Tenth Circuit's finding that Colorado intends to force Ms. Smith to convey a message she does not believe with the very purpose of eliminating  ideas that differ from its own. 6 F.4th at 1178.4",,0,
2022-019,90,"Nor does the dissent's reimagination end there. It claims that, for the first time in its history, the Court grants a business open to the public a right to refuse to serve members of a protected class. Post, at 2322, see also id., at 26, n. 10, 35, 14 S.Ct. 1098. Never mind that we do no such thing and Colorado itself has stipulated Ms. Smith will (as CADA requires) work with all people regardless of  sexual orientation. App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. Never mind, too, that it is the dissent that would have this Court do something truly novel by allowing a government to coerce an individual to speak contrary to her beliefs on a significant issue of personal conviction, all in order to eliminate ideas that differ from its own.",,0,
2022-019,91,"There is still more. The dissent asserts that we sweep under the rug petitioners' challenge to CADA's Communication Clause. Post, at 26. This despite the fact the parties and the Tenth Circuit recognized that Ms. Smith's Communication Clause challenge hinges on her Accommodation Clause challenge. (So much so that Colorado devoted less than two pages at the tail end of its brief to the Communication Clause and the Tenth Circuit afforded it just three paragraphs in its free-speech analysis. See Brief for Respondents 44-45, 6 F.4th at 1182-1183.)5 The dissent even suggests that our decision today is akin to endorsing a separate but equal regime that would allow law firms to refuse women admission into partnership, restaurants to deny service to Black Americans, or businesses seeking employees to post something like a White Applicants Only sign. Post, at 2322, 2330-2333, 2335 2336, 2337-2338, 2339, and n. 13, 2342. Pure fiction all.",,0,
2022-019,92,"In some places, the dissent gets so turned around about the facts that it opens fire on its own position. For instance: While stressing that a Colorado company cannot refuse the full and equal enjoyment of its services based on a customer's protected status, post, at 2336, the dissent assures us that a company selling creative services to the public does have a right to decide what messages to include or not to include, post, at 2337. But if that is true, what are we even debating?",,0,
2022-019,93,"Instead of addressing the parties' stipulations about the case actually before us, the dissent spends much of its time adrift on a sea of hypotheticals about photographers, stationers, and others, asking if they too provide expressive services covered by the First Amendment. Post, at 2336-2338, 2338-2339, 2342. But those cases are not this case. Doubtless, determining what qualifies as expressive activity protected by the First Amendment can sometimes raise difficult questions. But this case presents no complication of that kind. The parties have stipulated that Ms. Smith seeks to engage in expressive activity. And the Tenth Circuit has recognized her services involve pure speech. See supra, at 2310, 2312. Nothing the dissent says can alter this—nor can it displace the First Amendment protections that follow.",,0,
2022-019,94,"The dissent's treatment of precedent parallels its handling of the facts. Take its remarkable suggestion that a government forcing an individual to create speech on weighty issues with which she disagrees—all, as the Tenth Circuit found, with the goal of eliminating views it does not share, 6 F.4th at 1178—only incidentally burdens First Amendment liberties. Post, at 2335-2341. Far from embracing a notion like that, our cases have rejected it time after time—including in the context of public accommodations laws. See Parts II-IV, supra, FAIR, 547 U. S., at 61-64, 126 S.Ct. 1297 (no government may affect a speaker's own message by forcing her to accommodate views she does not hold), Hurley, 515 U. S., at 563, 566, 115 S.Ct. 2338 (using a  public accommodations law to compel parade organizers to include speech they did not believe was no mere `incidental' infringement on First Amendment rights), Dale, 530 U. S., at 659, 120 S.Ct. 2446 (employing a public accommodations law to require the Boy Scouts to alter their admissions policies had more than an incidental effect on protected speech).6",,0,
2022-019,95,"When it finally gets around to discussing these controlling precedents, the dissent offers a wholly unpersuasive attempt to distinguish them. The First Amendment protections furnished in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale, the dissent declares, were limited to schoolchildren and nonprofits, and it is dispiriting to think they might also apply to Ms. Smith's commercial activity. Post, at 2339-2341. But our precedents endorse nothing like the limits the dissent would project on them. Instead, as we have seen, the First Amendment extends to all persons engaged in expressive conduct, including those who seek profit (such as speechwriters, artists, and website designers). See supra, at 2316-2317. If anything is truly dispiriting here, it is the dissent's failure to take seriously this Court's enduring commitment to protecting the speech rights of all comers, no matter how controversial— or even repugnant—many may find the message at hand.",,0,
2022-019,96,"Finally, the dissent comes out and says what it really means: Once Ms. Smith offers some speech, Colorado would require her to create and sell speech, notwithstanding her sincere objection to doing so—and the dissent would force her to comply with that demand. Post, at 2338. Even as it does so, however, the dissent refuses to acknowledge where its reasoning leads. In a world like that, as Chief Judge Tymkovich highlighted, governments could force an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a film with a Zionist message, they could compel an atheist muralist to accept a commission celebrating Evangelical zeal, and they could require a gay website designer to create websites for a group advocating against same-sex marriage, so long as these speakers would accept commissions from the public with different messages. 6 F.4th at 1199 (dissenting opinion). Perhaps the dissent finds these possibilities untroubling because it trusts state governments to coerce only enlightened speech. But if that is the calculation, it is a dangerous one indeed.7  The dissent is right about one thing— what a difference time can make. See post, at 2322-2323 (internal quotation marks omitted). Eighty years ago in Barnette, this Court affirmed that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion. 319 U.S. at 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178. The Court did so despite the fact that the speech rights it defended were deeply unpopular, at the time, the world was at war and many thought respect for the flag and the pledge essential for the welfare of the state. Id., at 662-663, 63 S.Ct. 1178 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), see also id., at 636, 640, 63 S.Ct. 1178 (majority opinion). Fifty years ago, this Court protected the right of Nazis to march through a town home to many Holocaust survivors and along the way espouse ideas antithetical to those for which this Nation stands. See Skokie, 432 U. S., at 43-44, 97 S.Ct. 2205, supra, at 2316-2317. Five years ago, in a case the dissenters highlight at the outset of their opinion, the Court stressed that it is not the role of the State or its officials to prescribe what shall be offensive. Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct. at 1746.

2022-019,97,"Today, however, the dissent abandons what this Court's cases have recognized time and time again: A commitment to speech for only some messages and some persons is no commitment at all. By approving a government's effort to eliminate disfavored ideas, 6 F.4th at 1178, today's dissent is emblematic of an unfortunate tendency by some to defend First Amendment values only when they find the speaker's message sympathetic.

In the past, other States in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale have similarly tested the First Amendment's boundaries by seeking to compel speech they thought vital at the time. But, as this Court has long held, the opportunity to think for ourselves and to express those thoughts freely is among our most cherished liberties and part of what keeps our Republic strong.

2022-019,113,"A public accommodations law has two core purposes. First, the law ensures  equal access to publicly available goods and services. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 468 U.S. 609, 624, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) (emphasis added). For social groups that face discrimination, such access is vital. All the more so if the group is small in number or if discrimination against the group is widespread. Equal access is mutually beneficial: Protected persons receive equally effective and meaningful opportunity to benefit from all aspects of life in America, 135 Cong. Rec. 8506 (1989) (remarks of Sen. Harkin) (Americans with Disabilities Act), and society, in return, receives the benefits of wide participation in political, economic, and cultural life. Roberts, 468 U. S., at 625, 104 S.Ct. 3244.",,0,
2022-019,114,"Second, a public accommodations law ensures equal dignity in the common market. Indeed, that is the law's fundamental object: to vindicate `the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to public establishments.' Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 250, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964) (quoting S. Rep. No. 872, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 16 (1964)). This purpose does not depend on whether goods or services are otherwise available. `Discrimination is not simply dollars and cents, hamburgers and movies, it is the humiliation, frustration, and embarrassment that a person must surely feel when he is told that he is unacceptable as a member of the public because of his social identity. It is equally the inability to explain to a child that regardless of education, civility, courtesy, and morality he will be denied the right to enjoy equal treatment.' 379 U.S. at 292, 85 S.Ct. 348 (Goldberg, J., concurring). When a young Jewish girl and her parents come across a business with a sign out front that says, `No dogs or Jews allowed,'3 the fact that another business might serve her family does not redress that stigmatizing injury, Roberts, 468 U. S., at 625, 104 S.Ct. 3244. Or, put another way, the hardship Jackie Robinson suffered when on the road with his baseball team was not an inability to find some hotel that would have him, it was the indignity of not being allowed to stay in the same hotel as his white teammates.

Moreover, a law that prohibits only such acts by businesses open to the public is narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest.

Some public accommodations laws, such as the federal Civil Rights Act, list establishments that qualify, but these establishments are ones open to the public generally. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(b) (hotels, restaurants, gas stations, movie theaters, concert halls, sports arenas, stadiums). A public accommodations law does not force anyone to start a business, or to hold out the business's goods or services to the public at large. The law also does not compel any business to sell any particular good or service. But if a business chooses to profit from the public market, which is established and maintained by the state, the state may require the business to abide by a legal norm of nondiscrimination.

S. 644, 660-661, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015). Gays and lesbians were also prohibited from most government employment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to associate. Id., at 661, 135 S.Ct. 2584. These policies worked to create and reinforce the belief that gay men and lesbians constituted an inferior class.

The Court, however, reasoned that the schools' practice of denying educational services to racial minorities was not shielded by the First Amendment, for two reasons: First, the Constitution places no value on discrimination. 427 U.S. at 176, 96 S.Ct. 2586 (alterations and internal quotations marks omitted). Second, the government's regulation of conduct did not inhibit the schools' ability to teach its preferred ideas or dogma. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

2022-019,155,"First Amendment rights of expression and association were also raised to challenge laws against sex discrimination. In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, the United States Jaycees sought an exemption from a Minnesota law that forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public accommodations. The U. S. Jaycees was a civic organization, which until then had denied admission to women. The organization alleged that applying the law to require it to include women would violate its members' constitutional rights of free speech and association. 468 U.S. at 615, 104 S.Ct. 3244. The power of the state to change the membership of an organization is inevitably the power to change the way in which it speaks, the Jaycees argued. Brief for Appellee, O. T. 1983, No. 83-724, p. 19 (emphasis added). Thus, the right of the Jaycees to decide its own membership was inseparable, in its view, from its ability to freely express itself. Ibid.",,0,
2022-019,156,"This Court took a different view. The Court held that the application of the Minnesota statute to compel the Jaycees to accept women did not infringe the organization's First Amendment freedom of expressive association. Roberts, 468 U. S., at 622, 104 S.Ct. 3244. That was so because the State's public accommodations law did not aim at the suppression of speech and did not distinguish between prohibited and permitted activity on the basis of viewpoint. Id., at 623-624, 104 S.Ct. 3244. If the State had applied the law for the purpose of hampering the organization's ability to express its views, that would be a different matter. Id., at 624, 104 S.Ct. 3244 (emphasis added). Instead, the law's purpose was eliminating discrimination and assuring the State's citizens equal access to publicly available goods and services. Ibid.

The law partnership was an act of association. Its services (legal advocacy) were expressive, indeed, they consisted of speech. So the law firm argued that requiring it to consider a woman for the partnership violated its First Amendment rights of free expression and of commercial association. Brief for Respondent, O. T. 1983, No. 82-940, pp. 14-18. This Court rejected that argument. The application of Title VII did not infringe constitutional rights of expression or association, the Court held, because compliance with Title VII did not inhibit the partnership's ability to advocate for certain ideas and beliefs. 467 U.S. at 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also supra, at 2331-2332 (discussing Runyon, 427 U.

Under state law, the business is free to include, or not to include, any lawful message it wants in its wedding websites. The only thing the business may not do is deny whatever websites it offers on the basis of sexual orientation.

The fact that this will require an employer to take down a sign reading `White Applicants Only' hardly means that the law should be analyzed as one regulating the employer's speech rather than conduct.

In that case, the Court upheld the application of a law against the destruction of draft cards to a defendant who had burned his draft card to protest the Vietnam War. The protester's conduct was indisputably expressive. Indeed, it was political expression, which lies at the heart of the First Amendment. Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Yet the O'Brien Court focused on whether the Government's interest in regulating the conduct was to burden expression. Because it was not, the regulation was subject to lesser constitutional scrutiny. 391 U. S., at 376-377, 381-382, 88 S.Ct. 1673, Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 294, 299, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984).

FAIR, 547 U. S., at 67, 126 S.Ct. 1297 (quoting United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 86 L.Ed.2d 536 (1985)).9",,0,

A group of law schools challenged the Solomon Amendment based on their sincere objection to the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. For those who are too young to know, Don't Ask, Don't Tell was a homophobic policy that barred openly LGBT people from serving in the military.

The schools provided recruiting assistance in the form of emails, notices on bulletin boards, and flyers. 547 U. S., at 60-61, 126 S.Ct. 1297. As the Court acknowledged, those services clearly involve speech. Id., at 60, 126 S.Ct. 1297. And the Solomon Amendment required schools offering such services to other recruiters to provide them equally on behalf of the military, even if the school deeply objected to creating such speech. Id., at 61, 126 S.Ct. 1297. But that did not transform the equal provision of services into compelled speech of the kind barred by the First Amendment, because the school's speech was only `compelled' if, and to the extent, the school provides such speech for other recruiters. Id., at 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297. Thus, any speech compulsion was plainly incidental to the Solomon Amendment's regulation of conduct. Ibid.",,0,
2022-019,175,"The same principle resolves this case. The majority tries to sweep under the rug petitioners' challenge to CADA's Communication  Clause, so I will start with it. Recall that Smith wants to post a notice on her company's homepage that the company will refuse to sell any website for a same-sex couple's wedding. This Court, however, has already said that a ban on race-based hiring may require employers to remove `White Applicants Only' signs. Sorrell, 564 U. S., at 567, 131 S.Ct. 2653 (quoting FAIR, 547 U.

So petitioners concede that they are not entitled to an exemption from the Communication Clause unless they are also entitled to an exemption from the Accommodation Clause.

2022-019,176,"CADA's Accommodation Clause and its application here are valid regulations of conduct. It is well settled that a public accommodations law like the Accommodation Clause does not target speech or discriminate on the basis of its content. Hurley, 515 U. S., at 572, 115 S.Ct. 2338. Rather, the focal point of its prohibition is on the act of discriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and services. Ibid. (emphasis added).

2022-019,177,"Crucially, the law does not dictate the content of speech at all, which is only `compelled' if, and to the extent, the company offers such speech to other customers. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297. Colorado does not require the company to speak the State's preferred message. Ante, at 2318. Nor does it prohibit the company from speaking the company's preferred message. The company could, for example, offer only wedding websites with biblical quotations describing marriage as between one man and one woman. Brief for Respondents 15. (Just as it could offer only t-shirts with such quotations.) The company could also refuse to include the words Love is Love if it would not provide those words to any customer. All the company has to do is offer its services without regard to customers' protected characteristics. Id., at 15-16. Any effect on the company's speech is therefore incidental to the State's content-neutral regulation of conduct. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297, see Hurley, 515 U.

2022-019,178,"Once these features of the law are understood, it becomes clear that petitioners' freedom of speech is not abridged in any meaningful sense, factual or legal. Petitioners remain free to advocate the idea that same-sex marriage betrays God's laws. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 60, 126 S.Ct. 1297, Hishon, 467 U. S., at 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229, Runyon, 427 U. S., at 176, 96 S.Ct. 2586. Even if Smith believes God is calling her to do so through her for-profit company,  the company need not hold out its goods or services to the public at large. Many filmmakers, visual artists, and writers never do. (That is why the law does not require Steven Spielberg or Banksy to make films or art for anyone who asks. But cf. ante, at 2313 — 2314, 2320 — 2321.) Finally, and most importantly, even if the company offers its goods or services to the public, it remains free under state law to decide what messages to include or not to include. To repeat (because it escapes the majority): The company can put whatever harmful or low-value speech it wants on its websites. It can tell people what they do not want to hear. Ante, at 2321 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). All the company may not do is offer wedding websites to the public yet refuse those same websites to gay and lesbian couples. See Runyon, 427 U.

2022-019,179,"Another example might help to illustrate the point. A professional photographer is generally free to choose her subjects. She can make a living taking photos of flowers or celebrities. The State does not regulate that choice. If the photographer opens a portrait photography business to the public, however, the business may not deny to any person, because of race, sex, national origin, or other protected characteristic, the full and equal enjoyment of whatever services the business chooses to offer. That is so even though portrait photography services are customized and expressive. If the business offers school photos, it may not deny those services to multiracial children because the owner does not want to create any speech indicating that interracial couples are acceptable. If the business offers corporate headshots, it may not deny those services to women because the owner believes a woman's place is in the home. And if the business offers passport photos, it may not deny those services to Mexican Americans because the owner opposes immigration from Mexico.",,0,

If a photographer opens a photo booth outside of city hall and offers to sell newlywed photos captioned with the words Just Married, she may not refuse to sell that service to a newlywed gay or lesbian couple, even if she believes the couple is not, in fact, just married because in her view their marriage is false.

2022-019,182,"Because any burden on petitioners' speech is incidental to CADA's neutral regulation of commercial conduct, the regulation is subject to the standard set forth in O'Brien. That standard is easily satisfied here because the law's application promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 67, 126 S.Ct. 1297 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, this Court has already held that the State's goal of eliminating discrimination and assuring its citizens equal access to publicly available goods and services is unrelated to the suppression of expression and plainly serves compelling state interests of the highest order. Roberts, 468 U. S., at 624, 104 S.Ct. 3244. The Court has also held that by prohibiting only acts of invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods, services, and other advantages, the law responds precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concerns the State and abridges no more speech  than is necessary to accomplish that purpose. Id., at 628-629, 104 S.Ct. 3244 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted), see supra, at 2323-2325.",,0,
2022-019,184,"The Court reaches the wrong answer in this case because it asks the wrong questions. The question is not whether the company's products include elements of speech. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 61, 126 S.Ct. 1297. (They do.) The question is not even whether CADA would require the company to create and sell speech, notwithstanding the owner's sincere objection to doing so, if the company chooses to offer such speech to the public. Id., at 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297. (It would.) These questions do not resolve the First Amendment inquiry any more than they did in FAIR. Instead, the proper focus is on the character of state action and its relationship to expression. Because Colorado seeks to apply CADA only to the refusal to provide same-sex couples the full and equal enjoyment of the company's publicly available services, so that the company's speech is only `compelled' if, and to the extent, the company chooses to offer such speech to the public, any burden on speech is plainly incidental to a content-neutral regulation of conduct. Ibid.",,0,
2022-019,185,"The majority attempts to distinguish this clear holding of FAIR by suggesting that the compelled speech in FAIR was incidental because it was logistical (e.g., The U. S. Army recruiter will meet interested students in Room 123 at 11 a.m.). Ante, at 2317 (internal quotation marks omitted). This attempt fails twice over. First, the law schools in FAIR alleged that the Solomon Amendment required them to create and disseminate speech propagating the military's message, which they deeply objected to, and to include military speakers in on- and off-campus forums (if the schools provided equally favorable services to other recruiters). 547 U.S. at 60-61, 126 S.Ct. 1297, App. 27 and Brief for Respondents 5-8 in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., O. T. 2005, No. 04-1152. The majority simply skips over the Court's key reasoning for why any speech compulsion was nevertheless incidental to the Amendment's regulation of conduct: It would occur only if, and to the extent, the regulated entity provided such speech to others. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297. Likewise in O'Brien, the reason the burden on O'Brien's expression was incidental was not because his message was factual or uncontroversial. But cf. ante, at 2317-2318. O'Brien burned his draft card to send a political message, and the burden on his expression was substantial. Still, the burden was incidental because it was ancillary to a regulation that did not aim at expression. 391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673.",,0,
2022-019,186,"Second, the majority completely ignores the categorical nature of the exemption claimed by petitioners. Petitioners maintain, as they have throughout this litigation, that they will refuse to create any wedding website for a same-sex couple. Even an announcement of the time and place of a wedding (similar to the majority's example from FAIR) abridges petitioners' freedom of speech, they claim, because the announcement of the wedding itself is a concept that Smith believes to be false. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Indeed, petitioners here concede that if a same-sex couple came across an opposite-sex wedding website created by the company and requested an identical website, with only the names and date of the wedding changed, petitioners would refuse.

The company, says the majority, will not sell same-sex wedding websites to anyone. Ante, at 2316-2317. It will sell only opposite-sex wedding websites, that is its service. Petitioners, however, cannot define their service as `opposite-sex wedding websites' any more than a hotel can recast its services as `whites-only lodgings.' Telescope Media Group v. Lucero, 936 F.3d 740, 769 (CA8 2019) (Kelly, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

She just will not sell websites for same-sex weddings. Apparently, a gay or lesbian couple might buy a wedding website for their straight friends. This logic would be amusing if it were not so embarrassing.12 I suppose the Heart of Atlanta Motel could have argued that Black people may still rent rooms for their white friends. Smith answers that she will sell other websites for gay or lesbian clients. But then she, like Ollie McClung, who would serve Black people take-out but not table service, discriminates against LGBT people by offering them a limited menu.13 This is plain to see, for all who do not look the other way.",,0,

The law schools in FAIR likewise relied on Hurley and Dale to argue that the Solomon Amendment violated their free-speech rights. FAIR confirmed, however, that a neutral regulation of conduct imposes an incidental burden on speech when the regulation grants a right of equal access that requires the regulated party to provide speech only if, and to the extent, it provides such speech for others.

The Court in Hurley and Dale stressed that the speech burdens in those cases were not incidental to prohibitions on status-based discrimination because the associations did not assert that mere acceptance of a member from a particular group would impair the association's message. Dale, 530 U. S., at 653, 120 S.Ct. 2446, see also ibid. (reasoning that Dale was excluded for being a gay rights activist, not for being gay), ibid.

And the company confirms that it plans to engage in status-based discrimination. Supra, at 2333-2334, 2338-2339. Therefore, any burden on the company's expression is incidental to the State's content-neutral regulation of commercial conduct.",,0,
2022-019,192,"Frustrated by this inescapable logic, the majority dials up the rhetoric, asserting that Colorado seeks to compel the company's speech in order to excise certain ideas or viewpoints from the public dialogue. The State's very purpose in seeking to apply its law, in the majority's view, is the coercive elimination of dissenting ideas about marriage. Ante, at 2312-2313 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).14 That is an astonishing view of the law. It is contrary to the fact that a law requiring public-facing businesses to accept all comers is textbook viewpoint neutral, Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v.

A content-neutral equal-access policy is a far cry from a mandate to endorse a pledge chosen by the Government. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297. This Court has said it trivializes the freedom protected in Barnette to equate the two. Ibid. Requiring Smith's company to abide by a law against invidious discrimination in commercial sales to the public does not conscript her into espousing the government's message.

All it does is require her to stick to her bargain: The owner who hangs a shingle and offers her services to the public cannot retreat from the promise of open service, to do so is to offer the public marked money.

The Supreme Court of the United States declares that a particular kind of business, though open to the public, has a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of a protected class. The Court does so for the first time in its history. By issuing this new license to discriminate in a case brought by a company that seeks to deny same-sex couples the full and equal enjoyment of its services, the immediate, symbolic effect of the decision is to mark gays and lesbians for second-class status. In this way, the decision itself inflicts a kind of stigmatic harm, on top of any harm caused by denials of service.

To see how, imagine a same-sex couple browses the public market with their child. The market could be online or in a shopping mall. Some stores sell products that are customized and expressive. The family sees a notice announcing that services will be refused for same-sex weddings. What message does that send? It sends the message that we live in a society with social castes. It says to the child of the same-sex couple that their parents' relationship is not equal to others'. And it reminds LGBT people of a painful feeling that they know all too well: There are some public places where they can be themselves, and some where they cannot. K. Yoshino, Covering 61-66 (2006). Ask any LGBT person, and you will learn just how often they are forced to navigate life in this way. They must ask themselves: If I reveal my identity to this co-worker, or to this shopkeeper, will they treat me the same way? If I hold the hand of my partner in this setting, will someone stare at me, harass me, or even hurt me? It is an awful way to live.

The decision threatens to balkanize the market and to allow the exclusion of other groups from many services.

One such exception bars debtors from discharging any debt for money obtained by  fraud. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A). The provision obviously applies to a debtor who was the fraudster. But sometimes a debtor is liable for fraud that she did not personally commit—for example, deceit practiced by a partner or an agent. We must decide whether the bar extends to this situation too.

Alleging that he had overpaid in reliance on the Bartenwerfers' misrepresentations, Buckley sued them in California state court.

2022-020,44,"It is true, of course, that context can confine a passive-voice sentence to a likely set of actors. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U.S. 112, 128-129, 97 S.Ct. 965, 51 L.Ed.2d 204 (1977). If the dean of the law school delivers Bartenwerfer's hypothetical statement to Jane's parents, the most natural implication is that Jane's hard work led to the clerkship. But in the fraud-discharge exception, context does not single out the wrongdoer as the relevant actor. Quite the opposite: The relevant legal context—the common law of fraud—has long maintained that fraud liability is not limited to the wrongdoer. Field v. Mans, 516 U.S. 59, 70-75, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (interpreting § 523(a)(2)(A) with reference to the common law of fraud). For instance, courts have traditionally held principals liable for the frauds of their agents. McCord v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 39 Minn. 181, 185, 39 N.W. 315, 317 (1888), Tome v. Parkersburg Branch R. Co., 39 Md. 36, 70-71 (1873), White v. Sawyer, 82 Mass. 586, 589 (1860), J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Agency 465-467 (1839). They have also held individuals liable for the frauds committed by their partners within the scope of the partnership. Tucker v. Cole, 54 Wis. 539, 540-541, 11 N.W. 703, 703-704 (1882), Alexander v. State, 56 Ga. 478, 491-493 (1876), Chester v. Dickerson, 54 N.Y. 1, 11 (1873), J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Partnership 161, 257-259 (1841). Understanding § 523(a)(2)(A) to reflect the passive voice's usual agnosticism is thus consistent with the age-old rule that individual debtors can  be liable for fraudulent schemes they did not devise.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,45,"Searching for a way to defeat the natural breadth of the passive voice, Bartenwerfer points to our observation that `exceptions to discharge should be confined to those plainly expressed.' Bullock v. BankChampaign, N. A., 569 U.S. 267, 275, 133 S.Ct. 1754, 185 L.Ed.2d 922 (2013) (quoting Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U.S. 57, 62, 118 S.Ct. 974, 140 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998)). This does not get her far. We have never used this principle to artificially narrow ordinary meaning, which is what Bartenwerfer asks us to do. Instead, we have invoked it to stress that exceptions should not extend beyond their stated terms. In Gleason v. Thaw, we held that liabilities for obtaining property did not include an attorney's services because services are not property. 236 U.S. 558, 559-562, 35 S.Ct. 287, 59 L.Ed. 717 (1915). In Kawaauhau, we concluded that medical malpractice attributable to negligence or recklessness did not amount to a willful and malicious injury. 523 U.S. at 59, 118 S.Ct. 974. And in Bullock, interpreting the discharge exception for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny, we applied the familiar noscitur a sociis canon to hold that the term defalcation possessed a mens rea requirement akin to those of fraud, embezzlement, and larceny. 569 U.S. at 269, 274-275, 133 S.Ct. 1754. In each case, we reached a result that was plainly expressed by the text and ordinary tools of interpretation. Our interpretation in this case, which rests on basic tenets of grammar, is more of the same.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,46,"Bartenwerfer also seeks support from § 523(a)(2)(A)'s neighboring provisions, which both require action by the debtor herself. Section 523(a)(2)(B) bars the discharge of debts arising from the use of a statement in writing—(i) that is materially false, (ii) respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition, (iii) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable reasonably relied, and (iv) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive. (Emphasis added.) Similarly, § 523(a)(2)(C) presumptively bars the discharge of recently acquired consumer debts owed to a single creditor and aggregating more than $500 for luxury goods or services incurred by an individual debtor and cash advances aggregating more than $750  obtained by an individual debtor. § 523(a)(2)(C)(i) (emphasis added). Unlike subparagraph (A), the discharge exceptions in subparagraphs (B) and (C) expressly require some culpable act on the part of the debtor. According to Bartenwerfer, these provisions make explicit what goes without saying in (A): The debtor's own fraud must have given rise to the debt.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,47,"This argument flips the rule that `when Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act,' we generally take the choice to be deliberate. Badgerow v. Walters, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1310, 1318, 212 L.Ed.2d 355 (2022) (quoting Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1761, 1782, 210 L.Ed.2d 432 (2021)). As the word generally indicates, this rule is not absolute. Context counts, and it is sometimes difficult to read much into the absence of a word that is present elsewhere in a statute. See, e.g., Field, 516 U.S. at 67-69, 116 S.Ct. 437. But if there is an inference to be drawn here, it is not the one that Bartenwerfer suggests. The more likely inference is that (A) excludes debtor culpability from consideration given that (B) and (C) expressly hinge on it.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,48,"Bartenwerfer retorts that it would have made no sense for Congress to set up such a dichotomy, particularly between (A) and  (B). These two provisions are linked: (A) carves out fraudulent statements respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition, while (B) governs such statements that are reduced to writing. In Bartenwerfer's view, it defies credulity to think that Congress would bar debtors from discharging liability for mine-run fraud they did not personally commit while simultaneously allowing debtors to discharge liability for (potentially more serious) fraudulent statements they did not personally make. Brief for Petitioner 23.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,49,"But in Field, we offered a possible answer for why (B) contains a more debtor-friendly discharge rule than (A): Congress may have wanted to moderate the burden on individuals who submitted false financial statements, not because lies about financial condition are less blameworthy than others, but because the relative equities might be affected by practices of consumer finance companies, which sometimes have encouraged such falsity by their borrowers for the very purpose of insulating their own claims from discharge. 516 U.S. at 76-77, 116 S.Ct. 437. This concern may also have informed Congress's decision to limit (B)'s prohibition on discharge to fraudulent conduct by the debtor herself. Whatever the rationale, it does not defy credulity to think that Congress established differing rules for (A) and (B). Brief for Petitioner 23.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,51,"Our precedent, along with Congress's response to it, eliminates any possible doubt about our textual analysis. In the late 19th century, the discharge exception for fraud read as follows: No debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt  shall be discharged under this act. Act of Mar. 2, 1867, § 33, 14 Stat. 533 (emphasis added). This language seemed to limit the exception to fraud committed by the debtor herself—the position that Bartenwerfer advocates here.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,52,"But we held otherwise in Strang v. Bradner. In that case, the business partner of John and Joseph Holland lied to fellow merchants in order to secure promissory notes for the benefit of their partnership. 114 U.S. at 557-558, 5 S.Ct. 1038. After a state court held all three partners liable for fraud, the Hollands tried to discharge their debts in bankruptcy on the ground that their partner's misrepresentations were not made by their direction nor with their knowledge. Id., at 557, 561, 5 S.Ct. 1038. Even though the statute required the debt to be created by the fraud of the bankrupt, we held that the Hollands could not discharge their debts to the deceived merchants. Id., at 561, 5 S.Ct. 1038. The fraud of one partner, we explained, is the fraud of all because each partner was the agent and representative of the firm with reference to all business within the scope of the partnership. Ibid. And the reason for this rule was particularly easy to see because the partners, who were not themselves guilty of wrong, received and appropriated the fruits of the fraudulent conduct of their associate in business. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,53,"The next development—Congress's post-Strang legislation—is the linchpin.3 This Court generally assumes that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is  aware of this Court's relevant precedents. Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1929, 1940, 213 L.Ed.2d 221 (2022). Section 523(a)(2) is no exception to this interpretive rule. Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct. 1752, 1761-1762, 201 L.Ed.2d 102 (2018). So if Congress had reenacted the discharge exception for fraud without change, we would assume that it meant to incorporate Strang's interpretation. Appling, 584 U. S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1761-1762, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978).",Barrett,0,
2022-020,54,"But Congress went even further than mere reenactment. Thirteen years after Strang, when Congress next overhauled bankruptcy law, it deleted of the bankrupt from the discharge exception for fraud, which is the predecessor to the modern § 523(a)(2)(A). Act of July 1, 1898, § 17, 30 Stat. 550 (A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as  are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another). By doing so, Congress cut from the statute the strongest textual hook counseling against the outcome in Strang. The unmistakable implication is that Congress embraced Strang's holding—so we do too.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,56,"In a last-ditch effort to persuade us, Bartenwerfer invokes the fresh start policy of modern bankruptcy law. Precluding faultless debtors from discharging liabilities run up by their associates, she says, is inconsistent with that policy, so § 523(a)(2)(A) cannot apply to her. A contrary holding would be a throwback to the harsh days when debtors faced `perpetual bondage to their creditors,' surviving on `a miserable pittance and dependent upon the bounty or forbearance of their creditors.' Brief for Petitioner 16 (quoting 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 5 (1833)). The same Congress that championed the fresh start could not also have shackled honest debtors with liability for frauds that they did not personally commit. Brief for Petitioner 37.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,57,"This argument earns credit for color but not much else. To begin, it characterizes the Bankruptcy Code as focused on the unadulterated pursuit of the debtor's interest. But the Code, like all statutes, balances multiple, often competing interests. Section 523 is a case in point: Barring certain debts from discharge necessarily reflects aims distinct from wiping the bankrupt's slate clean. Perhaps Congress concluded that these debts involved particularly deserving creditors, particularly undeserving debtors, or both. Regardless, if a fresh start were all that mattered, § 523 would not exist. No statute pursues a single policy at all costs, and we are not free to rewrite this statute (or any other) as if it did. Azar v. Allina Health Services, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1804, 1815, 204 L.Ed.2d 139 (2019).",Barrett,0,
2022-020,58,"It also bears emphasis—because the thread is easily lost in Bartenwerfer's argument—that § 523(a)(2)(A) does not define the scope of one person's liability for another's fraud. That is the function of the underlying law—here, the law of California. Section 523(a)(2)(A) takes the debt as it finds it, so if California did not extend liability to honest partners, § 523(a)(2)(A) would have no role to play. Bartenwerfer's fairness-based critiques seem better directed toward the state law that imposed the obligation on her in the first place.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,59,"And while Bartenwerfer paints a picture of liability imposed willy-nilly on hapless bystanders, the law of fraud does not work that way. Ordinarily, a faultless individual is responsible for another's debt only when the two have a special relationship, and even then, defenses to liability are available. For instance, though an employer is generally accountable for the wrongdoing of an employee, he usually can escape liability if he proves that the employee's action was committed outside the scope of employment. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.07 (2006), D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, & E. Bublick, Law of Torts § 425 (2022). Similarly, if one partner takes a wrongful act without authority or outside the ordinary course of business, then the partnership—and by extension, the innocent partners—are generally not on the hook. Uniform Partnership Act § 305 (2013). Partnerships and other businesses can also organize as limited-liability entities, which insulate individuals from personal exposure to the business's debts. See, e.g., § 306(c) (limited-liability partnerships), Uniform Limited Partnership Act § 303(a) (2013) (limited partnerships), Uniform Limited Liability Company Act § 304(a) (2013) (limited-liability companies).",Barrett,0,
2022-020,60,"Individuals who themselves are victims of fraud are also likely to have defenses to liability. If a surety or guarantor is duped into assuming secondary liability, then his obligation is typically voidable. Law of Suretyship and Guaranty § 6:8 (2022), Restatement (Third) of Suretyship & Guaranty § 12 (1996). Likewise, if a purchaser unwittingly contracts for fraudulently obtained property, he may be able to rescind the agreement. 27 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 69:47 (4th ed. 2022). Thus, victims have a variety of antecedent defenses at their disposal that, if successful, protect them from acquiring any debt to discharge in a later bankruptcy proceeding.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,61,"All of this said, innocent people are sometimes held liable for fraud they did not personally commit, and, if they declare bankruptcy, § 523(a)(2)(A) bars discharge of that debt. So it is for Bartenwerfer, and we are sensitive to the hardship she faces. But Congress has evidently concluded that the creditors' interest in recovering full payment of debts obtained by fraud outweighs the debtors' interest in a complete fresh start, Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 287, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991), and it is not our role to second-guess that judgment.",Barrett,0,
2022-020,63,We affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment that Kate Bartenwerfer's debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.,Barrett,0,

2022-020,66,"The Court correctly holds that 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A) bars debtors from discharging a debt obtained by fraud of the debtor's agent or partner. Congress incorporated into the statute the common-law principles of fraud, Husky Int'l Electronics, Inc. v. Ritz, 578 U.S. 356, 360, 136 S.Ct. 1581, 194 L.Ed.2d 655 (2016) (citing Field v. Mans, 516 U.S. 59, 69, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995)), which include agency and partnership principles, ante, at 672-673. This Court long ago confirmed that reading when it held that fraudulent debts obtained by partners are not dischargeable, Strang v. Bradner, 114 U.S. 555, 559-561, 5 S.Ct. 1038, 29 L.Ed. 248 (1885), and Congress embraced that reading when it amended the statute in 1898, ante, at 675.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-020,67,"The Bankruptcy Court found that petitioner and her husband had an agency relationship and obtained the debt at issue after they formed a partnership. Because petitioner does not dispute that she and her husband acted as partners, the debt is not dischargeable under the statute.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-020,68,"The Court here does not confront a situation involving fraud by a person bearing no agency or partnership relationship to the debtor. Instead, the relevant legal context concerns fraud only by agents and partners within the scope of the partnership. Ante, at 672. With that understanding, I join the Court's opinion.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-021,31,"The False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, imposes civil liability on any person who presents false or fraudulent claims for payment to the Federal Government. The statute is unusual in authorizing private parties—known as relators—to sue on the Government's behalf. When a relator files a complaint, the Government gets an initial opportunity to intervene in the case. If the Government does so, it takes the lead role. If not, that responsibility falls to the relator, the only person then pressing the suit. But even when that is so, the Government retains certain rights, including the right to intervene later upon a showing of good cause.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,32,"The questions presented here concern the Government's ability to dismiss an FCA suit over a relator's objection. Everyone  agrees that if the Government intervenes at the suit's start, it can later move to dismiss. But the parties dispute whether, or in what circumstances, the same is true if the Government declines its initial chance to intervene. And the parties disagree as well about the standard district courts should use in deciding whether to grant a Government motion to dismiss.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,33,"Today, we hold that the Government may seek dismissal of an FCA action over a relator's objection so long as it intervened sometime in the litigation, whether at the outset or afterward. We also hold that in handling such a motion, district courts should apply the rule generally governing voluntary dismissal of suits: Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,36,"The FCA dates to the Civil War, when a Congressional committee uncovered stupendous abuses in the sale of provisions and munitions to the War Department. H. R. Rep. No. 2, 37th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. II (1861). Testimony before Congress painted a sordid picture of how the United States had been billed for nonexistent or worthless goods, charged exorbitant prices for goods delivered, and generally robbed in purchasing the necessities of war. United States v. McNinch, 356 U.S. 595, 599, 78 S.Ct. 950, 2 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1958). To put a stop to the plunder—and more generally, to protect the funds and property of the Government—Congress enacted the FCA. Rainwater v. United States, 356 U.S. 590, 592, 78 S.Ct. 946, 2 L.Ed.2d 996 (1958). The Act, then as now, imposed civil liability for many deceptive practices meant to appropriate government assets.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,37,"From the start, the FCA has been enforced through a unique public-private scheme. Federal prosecutors may of course sue an alleged violator, all on their own. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(a). But private parties—again, relators—may also sue, in so-called qui tam actions. Those suits are brought in the name of the Government. § 3730(b)(1).1 And the injury they assert is exclusively to the Government. A qui tam suit, this Court has explained, alleges both an injury to the Government's sovereignty arising from violation of its laws and an injury to its proprietary interests resulting from a fraud. Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000). But in one important sense, a qui tam suit is, as the statute puts it, for both the relator and the Government. § 3730(b)(1) (describing the action as for the person and for the United States). The FCA, we have explained, effects a partial assignment of the Government's own damages claim. Id., at 773, 120 S.Ct. 1858. If the action leads to a recovery, the relator may receive up to 30% of the total. See §§ 3730(d)(1)-(2).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,38,"Because the relator is no ordinary civil plaintiff, he is immediately subject to special restrictions. He must file his complaint under seal, and serve both a copy and supporting material evidence on the Government alone. § 3730(b)(2). The Government then has 60 days (often extended for good cause) to decide whether to intervene and proceed with the action.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,39,"§§ 3730(b)(2)-(3). If the Government, during that so-called seal period, elects to intervene, the relator loses control: The action then shall be conducted by the Government, though the relator can continue as a party in a secondary role. §§ 3730(b)(4)(A), (c)(1). Only if the Government passes on intervention does the relator have the right to conduct the action. § 3730(b)(4)(B).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,40,"And even then, the relator is not home free. The Government, after all, is a real party in interest in a qui tam action. United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U.S. 928, 930, 129 S.Ct. 2230, 173 L.Ed.2d 1255 (2009). So Congress gave the Government continuing rights in the action—not least the right to the lion's share of the recovery. Most relevant here, the Government can intervene after the seal period ends, so long as it shows good cause to do so. See § 3730(c)(3).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,41,"The main issue here is whether the Government, if it has declined to intervene during the seal period, retains yet another right: the right to dismiss a qui tam action over the relator's objection. The FCA gives the Government unilateral authority to dismiss in at least some circumstances. Section 3730(c)(2)(A)—which we'll call Subparagraph (2)(A) for short—provides that the Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the relator, so long as the relator has received notice of the motion and an opportunity for a hearing. Nothing in the statute, however, expressly states whether (or when) that authority survives the Government's decision to let the seal period lapse without intervening.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,42,"The competing arguments on that score hinge significantly on surrounding provisions —more precisely, on how Subparagraph (2)(A) fits into the rest of § 3730(c). That subsection addresses the Rights of the Parties—the Government, the relator, and (more briefly) the defendant. It contains four relevant paragraphs, which we summarize in order. (Those who believe in verification may refer to this opinion's appendix, which lays out all of § 3730's relevant text.) A helpful hint to start with: You might want to pay attention to what each paragraph says—or not—about when it applies.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,43,"Paragraph 1 applies, as its first clause states, if the Government proceeds with the action. § 3730(c)(1). In that event, the Government shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the relator. Ibid. The relator still can continue as a party—file motions, conduct discovery, and so forth—but only subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2). Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,44,"Paragraph 2 then spells out certain rights of the Government. You have already seen Subparagraph (2)(A), enabling the Government to dismiss an action over the relator's objection (after notice and opportunity for a hearing). Subparagraph (2)(B) is similar. It allows the Government to settle an action notwithstanding the relator's objections, so long as the court finds after a hearing that the settlement is fair and reasonable. § 3730(c)(2)(B). Finally, subparagraphs (2)(C) and (2)(D) allow the court to limit the relator's participation in the case—because (among other reasons) it would interfere with the Government's prosecution of the case or cause the defendant undue burden. §§ 3730(c)(2)(C)-(D).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,45,"Next, Paragraph 3 applies, as its first clause states, if the Government elects not to proceed with the action. § 3730(c)(3). In that event, the relator shall have the right to conduct the action. Ibid. But a caveat immediately follows.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,46,"The Government, as noted above, may intervene at a later date—i.e., after the seal period—upon a showing of good cause. Ibid., see supra, at 1728. And last, there is a caveat to that caveat: In granting a later intervention motion, the court may not limit the status and rights of the relator. § 3730(c)(3).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,47,"Finally, Paragraph 4 applies, as its first clause states, whether or not the Government proceeds with the action. § 3730(c)(4). That provision enables the Government to obtain a stay of the relator's discovery if it would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a related legal matter.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,48,"And so to recap, focusing on the matter we suggested you attend to. See supra, at 1728. Paragraph 1 applies if the Government proceeds with the action. Paragraph 3 applies if the Government elects not to proceed with the action. Paragraph 4 applies whether or not the Government proceeds with the action. And Paragraph 2? It is not like the others. Though granting the Government important rights—including the right to dismissal over the relator's objection—Paragraph 2 does not specify when it applies. And that is the mystery at this case's heart.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,50,"With the game thus afoot, we turn to the facts—though there are only a few you need to know. Petitioner Jesse Polansky is a doctor who worked for respondent Executive Health Resources (EHR), a company that helped hospitals bill the United States for Medicare-covered services. In 2012, Polansky filed (under seal, as required) a qui tam action against EHR. The complaint alleged that EHR was enabling its clients to cheat the Government—essentially, by charging inpatient rates for what should have been outpatient services. After reviewing Polansky's evidence, the Government declined to intervene during the seal period. The case then spent years in discovery, with EHR demanding both documents and deposition testimony from the Government. As its discovery obligations mounted and weighty privilege issues emerged, the Government assessed and reassessed whether the suit should go forward. By 2019, it had decided that the varied burdens of the suit outweighed its potential value. The Government therefore filed a motion under Subparagraph (2)(A) to dismiss the action over Polansky's objection. The District Court granted the request, finding that the Government had thoroughly investigated the costs and benefits of allowing Polansky's case to proceed and had come to a valid conclusion based on the results of its investigation. 422 F.Supp.3d 916, 927 (ED Pa. 2019).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,51,"The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed after considering two legal questions. First, does the Government have authority to dismiss an action under Subparagraph (2)(A) if it declined to intervene during the seal period? The Court of Appeals held that the Government has that power so long as it intervened sometime later. See 17 F.4th 376, 383-388 (2021). And here, the Third Circuit found, the Government had satisfied that condition because its motion to dismiss was reasonably construed to include a motion to intervene, which the District Court had implicitly granted. See id., at 392-393.2 Second,  what standard should a district court use in ruling on a Subparagraph (2)(A) motion to dismiss? The Court of Appeals held that the proper standard comes from Federal Rule 41(a)—the rule governing voluntary dismissals in ordinary civil litigation. See id., at 389-391. And here, the Third Circuit ruled, the District Court's decision, which was based on a thorough examination of the interests that Rule 41 makes relevant, was not an abuse of discretion. Id., at 393.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,52,"Because both those questions have occasioned circuit splits, we granted certiorari. 596 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2834, 213 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2022), see 17 F.4th at 384, n. 8, 388 (outlining the splits). We now affirm the Third Circuit across the board.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,54,"To show why the Third Circuit is right on the first question presented— about when the Government can make what we'll call a (2)(A) motion—we proceed in two stages, corresponding to two sets of arguments. None of the parties here agrees with the Third Circuit. On the one side, the Government and EHR contend that a (2)(A) motion is always permissible, even if the Government has never intervened. Their argument is mainly one from silence: Because Paragraph 2 does not explicitly say when it applies—e.g., when the Government proceeds with the action or when it elects not to—the provision must apply all the time. §§ 3730(c)(1), (3). On the other side, Polansky (joined by the dissent) contends that the Government can make a (2)(A) motion only if it has intervened during the seal period. Polansky understands the dismissal power to arise only when the Government assumes primary responsibility for the action. And he does not think that occurs—rather, he thinks the relator remains in control—if the Government intervenes later on. To work our way through this thicket, we address first the Government's (and EHR's) theory, then Polansky's (and the dissent's). We come out the other end in the same place as the Third Circuit: Paragraph 2 (like Paragraph 1) applies only if the Government has intervened, but the timing of the intervention makes no difference. So the Government can file a (2)(A) motion to dismiss whenever (whether during the seal period or later) it has intervened.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,56,"Even taken alone, Paragraph 2 refutes the idea that it applies regardless of intervention. When the Government has chosen not to intervene in a qui tam suit, it is (by definition) not a party. See Eisenstein, 556 U.S., at 933, 129 S.Ct. 2230. And non-parties typically cannot do much of anything in a lawsuit. To be sure, a qui tam action is an unusual creature. Even as a non-party, the Government retains an interest in the suit, and possesses specified rights. See, e.g., § 3730(c)(4) (the right to get a stay of some discovery), § 3730(d)(2) (the right to share in the recovery). But Paragraph 2, unlike other FCA provisions, does not say that it applies when the Government is a non-party. See supra, at 1728-1729. So the Government can prevail on its argument only by implication. And the implication does not fit. The paragraph's first two provisions (Subparagraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B)) grant the Government uncommon, even extraordinary, power: to dismiss and settle an action over the objection of the person who brought it. That sort of authority would be odd to house in an entity that is taking no part  in—indeed, has continually declined to join—a case. And still more conclusive, the paragraph's next two provisions presuppose that the Government has in fact intervened. Subparagraph (2)(C) enables the court to restrict the relator's role when needed to prevent interference with—wait for it—the Government's prosecution of the case. And subparagraph (2)(D) allows the court to restrict the relator's participation if the defendant would otherwise suffer an undue burden. The premise is again that the Government has joined the case—else a court would be limiting the role of the defendant's sole adversary.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,57,"Zoom out to the rest of § 3730(c), and the Government's intervention is irrelevant view looks even weaker. Above Paragraph 2 is (you guessed it) Paragraph 1, which begins and ends in telling ways. Recall that Paragraph 1 starts by announcing that it applies only if the Government proceeds with the action— something that (everyone agrees) cannot happen unless the Government intervenes. See supra, at 1728. In that event, the paragraph says, the Government assumes primary responsibility for the suit. But still, the paragraph concludes, the relator may continue as a party, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2). That last subject to phrase links Paragraph 2 to Paragraph 1. It says that when the Paragraph 1 situation obtains, the relator's continuing role will be limited in the ways set out in Paragraph 2. And once again, the Paragraph 1 situation obtains only when the Government has intervened. So that is also when Paragraph 2's provisions (including the one about dismissal) kick in. In other words, the express intervention prerequisite of Paragraph 1 carries forward into Paragraph 2 through the subject to clause connecting the two. Only when Paragraphs 3 and 4 are reached does the necessity of intervention drop away. Recall that they apply, respectively, when the Government elects not to proceed and whether or not the Government proceeds. See supra, at 1729. By contrast, Paragraph 2 is explicitly hooked to Paragraph 1, which applies only when the Government proceeds.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,58,"And just to pile on a bit, the Government's alternative construction would create surplusage twice over. Consider first the whether or not introductory clause of Paragraph 4, noted just above. On the Government's view, that clause has no function: A provision lacking it would likewise apply whether or not the Government chose to intervene. The Government essentially concedes the point, urging only that Paragraph 4's preface is the sort of redundancy that is common in statutory drafting. Brief for United States 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly for the subject to  paragraph (2) proviso in Paragraph 1. On the Government's view, Congress need not have included that language, because every qui tam action (not just those described in Paragraph 1) is subject to Paragraph 2's limits. Again, the Government's only response is that Congress sometimes includes language that could be viewed as `redundant.' Id., at 22. Yes, sometimes. But on top of everything else, the Government's double violation of the interpretive principle that every clause and word of a statute should have meaning, Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 27 L.Ed. 431 (1883), dooms the view that Paragraph 2 applies even when the Government has not intervened. The paragraph does not then apply—which means that the Government cannot then file a (2)(A) motion to dismiss.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,60,"At the same time, a straightforward reading of the FCA refutes Polansky's  (and the dissent's) position—that Paragraph 2 (and also Paragraph 1) applies only when the Government's intervention occurs during the seal period. Recall the way the statute works: The Government can intervene at that early time—but so too it can intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause. § 3730(c)(3), see supra, at 1729. The consequence of a successful motion to intervene, in the FCA context as in any other, is to turn the movant into a party. See Eisenstein, 556 U.S., at 933-934, 129 S.Ct. 2230. And once the Government becomes a party, it (alongside the relator) does what parties do: It proceeds with the action. That quoted phrase, you'll recall, is the trigger for Paragraph 1: When the Government proceeds with the action, it assumes primary responsibility for the case's prosecution. And as shown above, whenever that is true, Paragraph 2 kicks in too. See supra, at 1730-1731. So the right to dismiss under Subparagraph (2)(A) attends a later intervention, just as it does an earlier one. Either way, the Government becomes a party, proceeding with the action, so either way, it acquires the right to dismiss.3",Kagan,0,
2022-021,61,"Polansky's contrary argument (echoed in the dissent) mainly relies on the clause in Paragraph 3 telling the court that it may not limit the status and rights of the relator when it approves a post-seal-period intervention motion. See Brief for Polansky 23, post, at 1739. That clause, he says, prevents the court from giving the Government primary responsibility over the suit, including the power to dismiss. But on that reading, the Paragraph 3 clause would effectively negate Paragraphs 1 and 2. The Paragraph 3 clause would prevent the Government, even though now proceeding with the case, from acquiring the control that Paragraphs 1 and 2 afford in that circumstance. Polansky's construction would thus put the statute at war with itself. United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 180, 31 S.Ct. 632, 55 L.Ed. 663 (1911). The statute would direct one result (the Government assuming the primary role upon intervening) while telling the court not to allow that state of affairs. The better reading makes the instruction to the court congruent with the background operation of the statute. The clause tells the court not to impose additional, extra-statutory limits on the relator when granting the Government's post-seal-period motion to intervene. See United States ex rel. CIMZNHCA, LLC v. UCB, Inc., 970 F.3d 835, 854 (CA7 2020) (explaining that the Paragraph 3 clause instructs the district court not to limit the relator's `status and rights' as they are defined by Paragraphs 1 and 2). In that way, Paragraph 3 ensures that the Government will get no special benefit from the court's involvement in a later intervention: The parties will occupy the same positions as they would have if the Government had intervened in the seal period.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,62,"That seal-agnostic view of intervention's effects also fits the FCA's Government-centered purposes. In Polansky's proposed world, the Government has primary control of the action if it intervenes in the seal period, but the relator has primary control if the intervention occurs later on. See Brief for Polansky 17. But in both cases, the Government's interest in the suit is the same—and is the predominant one. That interest is typically to redress injuries against the Government, through a suit brought in the Government's name. § 3730(b)(1). Or else, as here, that interest is to obtain dismissal of the suit because it will likely cost the Government more than it is worth. Either way, that interest does not diminish in importance because the Government waited to intervene. Congress decided not to make seal-period intervention an on-off switch. It knew that circumstances could change and new information come to light. So Congress enabled the Government, in the protection of its own interests, to reassess qui tam actions and change its mind. See S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 26 (1986) (explaining that the Government should have a continuing chance to intervene because new evidence might cause it to reevaluate its initial assessment). When it does so, nothing about the statute's objectives suggests that the Government should have to take a back seat to its co-party relator. The suit remains, as it was in the seal period, one to vindicate the Government's interests.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,64,"We thus arrive at this case's second question: When the Government, having properly intervened, seeks to dismiss an FCA action over a relator's objection, what standard should a district court use to assess the motion? The Third Circuit held that the appropriate standard derives from Federal Rule 41(a), which governs voluntary dismissals in ordinary civil litigation. See 17 F.4th at 389-391. Under that Rule, the standard varies with the case's procedural posture. If the defendant has not yet served an answer or summary-judgment motion, the plaintiff need only file a notice of dismissal. But once that threshold has been crossed—as in this case—dismissal requires a court order, on terms that the court considers proper. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 41(a)(2). Again, both the Government and Polansky object from different directions. The Government thinks it has essentially unfettered discretion to dismiss, Polansky proposes a complicated form of arbitrary-and-capricious review, with a burden-shifting component. But again, the Third Circuit's Goldilocks position is the legally right one. A district court should assess a (2)(A) motion to dismiss using Rule 41's standards. And in most FCA cases, as the Court of Appeals suggested, those standards will be readily satisfied. See 17 F.4th at 390-391, and n. 18.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,65,"The reason for alighting on Rule 41 is not complicated: The Federal Rules are the default rules in civil litigation, and nothing warrants a departure from them here. As Rule 1 states: These rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts (with specified exceptions not relevant here). Of course, Congress may override that command when it wishes. But we do not lightly infer that Congress has done so, and silence on the subject is seldom enough. See Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 212, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). Here, nothing in the FCA suggests that Congress meant to except qui tam actions from the usual voluntary dismissal rule. To the contrary, the FCA's many cross-references to the Rules suggest that their application is the norm. See, e.g.,  § 3732(a) (requiring that a summons in an FCA action comply with the Rules), §§ 3730(b)(2)-(3) (requiring service to the Government and defendant pursuant to Rule 4). And this Court has made clear that various Rules not specifically mentioned —in particular, those dealing with discovery—also apply. See Eisenstein, 556 U.S., at 933-934, 129 S.Ct. 2230. As a practical matter, the Federal Rules apply in FCA litigation in courts across the country every day. There is no reason to make an exception for the one about voluntary dismissals.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,66,"The application of Rule 41 in the FCA context will differ in two ways from the norm. The first pertains to procedure. The FCA requires notice and an opportunity for a hearing before a Subparagraph (2)(A) dismissal can take place. So the district court must use that procedural framework to apply Rule 41's standards.4 The second pertains to the set of interests the court should consider in ruling on a post-answer motion. In non-FCA cases, Rule 41(a)(2)'s proper terms analysis focuses on the defendant's interests: The court mainly addresses whether that party's commitment of time and money militates against dismissal. Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 397, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). But in the FCA context, the proper terms assessment is more likely to involve the relator. For all relators faced with a (2)(A) motion want their actions to go forward, and many have by then committed substantial resources. Part of the district court's task is to consider their interests. Cf. 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2364, p. 554 (4th ed. 2022) (explaining that a court, in applying Rule 41, should endeavor to ensure that substantial justice is accorded to all parties).",Kagan,0,
2022-021,67,"The Third Circuit, though, was right to note that (2)(A) motions will satisfy Rule 41 in all but the most exceptional cases. See 17 F.4th at 390-391, and n. 18. This Court has never set out a grand theory of what that Rule requires, and we will not do so here. The inquiry is necessarily contextual. 9 Wright & Miller § 2364, at 599. And in this context, the Government's views are entitled to substantial deference. A qui tam suit, as we have explained, is on behalf of and in the name of the Government. The suit alleges injury to the Government alone. And the Government, once it has intervened, assumes primary responsibility for the action. Given all that, a district court should think several times over before denying a motion to dismiss. If the Government offers a reasonable argument for why the burdens of continued litigation outweigh its benefits, the court should grant the motion. And that is so even if the relator presents a credible assessment to the contrary.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,68,"In light of those principles, this case is not a close call. A district  court's Rule 41 order is generally reviewable under an abuse-of-discretion standard, and the Third Circuit properly applied that standard here. But in the interest of providing guidance, it might be useful for us to put that standard of review to the side, and simply to say that the District Court got this one right. The Government, in moving to dismiss, enumerated the significant costs of future discovery in the suit, including the possible disclosure of privileged documents. At the same time, the Government explained in detail why it had come to believe that the suit had little chance of success on the merits. Polansky vigorously disputed the latter point, claiming that the Government was leaving billions of dollars of potential recovery on the table. 17 F.4th at 393 (emphasis deleted). But that competing assessment, the District Court thought, could not outweigh the Government's reasonable view of the suit's costs and benefits. We agree. The Government gave good grounds for thinking that this suit would not do what all qui tam actions are supposed to do: vindicate the Government's interests. Absent some extraordinary circumstance, that sort of showing is all that is needed for the Government to prevail on a (2)(A) motion to dismiss.",Kagan,0,
2022-021,70,"The Government may move to dismiss an FCA action under Subparagraph (2)(A) whenever it has intervened—whether during the seal period or later on. The applicable standards for deciding such a motion are those set out in Federal Rule 41. Under that Rule, the Government was entitled to dismiss this qui tam action.

2022-021,97,"In my view, the text and structure of the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, afford the Government no power to unilaterally dismiss a pending qui tam action after it has declined to take over the action from the relator at its outset. § 3730(b)(4)(B). Thus, I would vacate the judgment below and remand for the Third Circuit to consider the serious constitutional questions that may affect the disposition of the Government's motion to dismiss petitioner's qui tam suit. Because the Court instead affirms, I respectfully dissent.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,99,"The FCA provides that private parties known as relators may bring qui tam suits for themselves and for the United States Government. § 3730(b)(1). It then sets out a reticulated scheme to govern the initiation of a qui tam suit, see § 3730(b), the parties' procedural rights during the suit, see § 3730(c), and the rights of the parties to any proceeds at the end of the suit, see § 3730(d). See also ante, at 1727-1729, 1735-1737. The main structural feature of this scheme is the so-called seal period: a window of time at the start of every FCA qui tam action during which the suit is on hold and the Government must elect whether to intervene and proceed with the action, § 3730(b)(2), or, alternatively, to decline to take over the action and allow the relator to proceed, § 3730(b)(4)(B).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,100,"This case requires us to decide whether the Government enjoys the same panoply of procedural rights when it takes over an action during the seal period and when (as here) it intervenes in the action at a later date after the relator has proceeded with the action. § 3730(c)(3). Today, the Court holds that the Government has all of the same procedural rights in both circumstances,  including the right to dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the relator. § 3730(c)(2)(A). I would instead hold that the structure of the FCA's qui tam provisions and the clear text of § 3730(c)(3) do not permit the Government to seize the reins from the relator to unilaterally dismiss the suit after declining to proceed with an action during the seal period.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,101,"To bring out the statutory structure, it is helpful to take the FCA's qui tam provisions from the top. Under § 3730(b)(2), the first step in a qui tam suit is for the relator to file the complaint in camera and under seal, serving it on the Government but not the defendant. That filing starts the clock on a 60-day window in which the Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action. § 3730(b)(2). The Government may move to extend this seal period for cause, see § 3730(b)(3), but, ultimately, the Government faces a binary choice. It must either: (A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government, or (B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the relator shall have the right to conduct the action. § 3730(b)(4). Thus, under § 3730(b)(4), the Government's seal-period choice to proceed with the action or not determines who shall conduct the suit—the Government or the relator.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,102,"Section 3730(c) picks up at this critical juncture, defining the respective litigating rights of the Government and the relator based on the Government's choice to proceed with the action or not. First, paragraph (1) of subsection (c) (or, paragraph (c)(1)) provides: If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, but the relator shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to paragraph (c)(2)'s limitations.1 As used here, the phrase proceeds with the action naturally refers to the same seal-period choice for which § 3730 uses the same phrase in paragraph (b)(2) and subparagraph (b)(4)(A). And the Government having the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action appears synonymous with the Government conducting the action under subparagraph (b)(4)(A). See 3 Oxford English Dictionary 691 (2d ed. 1989) (defining conduct as to lead, command, direct, manage).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,103,"By contrast, paragraph (c)(3) provides: If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the relator shall have the right to conduct the action. The conditional clause of this sentence is a clear reference to the seal-period election described in paragraph (b)(2).2 Likewise, the result clause plainly echoes the right to conduct the action referred to under subparagraph (b)(4)(B), which the relator acquires when the Government does not proceed with the action under subparagraph (b)(4)(A) at the end of the seal period.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,104,"In short, the initial clauses of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) track subparagraphs (b)(4)(A) and (b)(4)(B) and point back to the Government's seal-period choice to proceed with the action or not. If the Government chooses to proceed with the action under § 3730(b)(4)(A), then  paragraph (c)(1) applies, along with the conditions of paragraph (c)(2). Conversely, if the Government elects not to proceed with the action under § 3730(b)(4)(B), then paragraph (c)(3) applies.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,105,"To be sure, the last sentence of paragraph (c)(3) provides: When the relator proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the relator, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause. But this sentence is not, as the majority reads it, a secret pass in paragraph (c)(3) that leads the parties back to their relative rights under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2). See ante, at 1731-1733. The sentence itself makes that clear by cautioning that the Government's later intervention may not limit the status and rights of the relator. § 3730(c)(3). Read in the context of §§ 3730(b)(4) and (c), this without limiting condition clearly preserves the relator's status as an autonomous litigant and the right to conduct the action that he acquired when the Government declined to take over the action at its inception. In other words, the plain import of the condition is that the relator keeps the right to conduct the action under §§ 3730(b)(4)(B) and (c)(3), as opposed to being demoted to paragraph (c)(1)'s inferior right to continue as a party with the restrictions set out in paragraph (c)(2).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,106,"The majority short-circuits this straightforward conclusion by essentially stipulating that the Government proceeds with the action—and thus activates paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)—whenever it is a party, regardless of when and how it became a party. See ante, at 1732, and n. 3. Nothing in the FCA's overall text or structure favors that interpretation. Nor does the text of paragraph (c)(3). When that provision describes the Government intervening after the seal period, it does not use the phrase proceed with the action (except in reference to the relator). Cf. § 3730(b)(2) (The Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action (emphasis added)). Nor is the majority's understanding compelled by the ordinary meaning of the term proceed. To proceed means to move forward, generally with the distinctive connotation of moving forward from a particular point. See 12 Oxford English Dictionary, at 544 (to go, move, or travel forward, to make one's way onward, esp. to move onward after interruption or stoppage, or after reaching a certain point). That idea fits the FCA like a glove. The Government proceeds with the action—as that phrase is used in §§ 3730(b)(2), (b)(4)(A), (c)(1), and (c)(3)— if it chooses to move forward with an action from the seal period, which is specifically set up for the Government to decide whether to proceed with the action, § 3730(b)(2).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,107,"The majority's interpretation of proceeds with the action in turn dictates an unnatural reading of paragraph (c)(3)'s without limiting condition. When the FCA says that the Government's belated intervention may not limit the relator's status and rights, it naturally means the status and rights that the relator actually enjoyed under paragraph (c)(3) immediately before the Government sought to intervene. By contrast, to accommodate its misreading of proceeds with the action, the majority is compelled to read paragraph (c)(3) to protect only the status and rights that the relator would have enjoyed in an alternative timeline where the Government intervened during the seal period and paragraph (c)(3) never came into play at all. See ante, at 1732-1733. That reading is counterintuitive, to say the least.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,108,"Nor is that the end of the problems with the majority's seal-agnostic view. Ibid. Immediately below subsection (c),  §§ 3730(d)(1) and (d)(2) establish two alternative ranges for the relator's share of any recovery at the end of a qui tam action. Like the parties' litigation rights under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3), those ranges depend on whether the Government has proceeded with the action or not. If the Government proceeds with an action brought  under subsection (b), the relator is usually entitled to between 15 and 25 percent of any recovery. § 3730(d)(1). Conversely, if the Government does not proceed with the action, the relator is entitled to 25 to 30 percent. § 3730(d)(2). Given the majority's view that intervention under paragraph (c)(3) counts as proceeding with the action, it follows that even an eleventh-hour intervention by the Government would automatically shunt the relator out of paragraph (d)(2)'s more generous range and into paragraph (d)(1)'s less generous one. Surely, that result would qualify as limiting the relator's status and rights. § 3730(c)(3).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,109,"The majority bolsters its tenuous textual and structural case with an appeal to the FCA's Government-centered purposes. Ante, at 1732-1733. But every statute purposes, not only to achieve certain ends, but also to achieve them by particular means. Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 U.S. 624, 637, 132 S.Ct. 2034, 182 L.Ed.2d 955 (2012) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). And, while it is certainly the FCA's ultimate goal to redress injuries against the Government, ante, at 1733, its chosen means is to empower private parties to seek redress of those injuries through litigation that the Government does not necessarily control and might not have brought if left to its own devices. Allowing the relator to maintain the suit after the Government has declined its initial opportunity to take it over (even if only to dismiss it) is fully consistent with the FCA.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,110,"Indeed, the FCA's history undermines the majority's free-floating account of its purposes. As enacted in 1863, the original FCA contained no provision for the Government to intervene in a relator's suit at all. See 12 Stat. 698. In 1943, Congress first gave the Government that opportunity by creating the 60-day seal period, which it set up to function as the very on-off switch the majority seems to consider implausible, ante, at 1733: Either the Government intervened during the seal period and assumed sole control of the action, or it did not intervene and was permanently excluded from the action. See 57 Stat. 608-609. Finally, in 1986, Congress revamped the FCA into its modern form, under which (as never before) the Government and the relator can litigate side by side as co-plaintiffs in the same action. In creating this possibility, Congress tweaked both halves of the previous regime in roughly parallel ways. If the Government intervenes during the seal period, paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) now permit the relator to remain a party and play a role in the litigation—but only a subordinate role. Conversely, if the Government does not intervene and proceed with the action during the seal period, it is not forever barred from taking a litigating role—but, if it intervenes later, it does not downgrade the relator's status and rights to those of a second-chair litigant. § 3730(c)(3).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,111,"In sum, the text, structure, and history of the FCA all point to the same conclusion. The FCA affords the Government no statutory right to unilaterally dismiss a declined action when it intervenes under § 3730(c)(3).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,113,"However, the text and structure of the FCA are not the end of the story. Defendant-respondent has pointed to serious  constitutional questions that might affect the disposition of the Government's motion here. At the same time, it is not clear that the parties have examined these questions in their full complexity, and the Third Circuit's reading of § 3730(c) gave it no reason to do so. Therefore, after holding that the Government could not invoke the dismissal authority of § 3730(c)(2)(A) as a statutory matter, I would remand this case for the Third Circuit to consider whether the Constitution nonetheless requires the dismissal of petitioner's suit.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,114,"The FCA's qui tam provisions have long inhabited something of a constitutional twilight zone. There are substantial arguments that the qui tam device is inconsistent with Article II and that private relators may not represent the interests of the United States in litigation. Because the entire `executive Power' belongs to the President alone, Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2183, 2197, 207 L.Ed.2d 494 (2020), it can only be exercised by the President and those acting under him, see id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2191-2192 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). And, as a lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a breach of the law, the Court has held that conducting civil litigation  for vindicating public rights of the United States is an executive function that may be discharged only by persons who are `Officers of the United States' under the Appointments Clause, Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138-140, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam) (some internal quotation marks omitted). A private relator under the FCA, however, is not appointed as an officer of the United States under Article II. Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Hunt, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1507, 1514, 203 L.Ed.2d 791 (2019). It thus appears to follow that Congress cannot authorize a private relator to wield executive authority to represent the United States' interests in civil litigation.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,115,"The potential inconsistency of qui tam suits with Article II has been noticed for decades. See, e.g., Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 252 F.3d 749, 758-775 (CA5 2001) (en banc) (Smith, J., dissenting), J. Blanch, Note, The Constitutionality of the False Claims Act's Qui Tam Provision, 16 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 701, 736-767 (1993), Constitutionality of the Qui Tam Provisions of the False Claims Act, 13 Op. OLC 207, 221-224, 228-232 (1989). The primary counterargument has emphasized the long historical pedigree of qui tam suits, including the fact that the First Congress passed a handful of qui tam statutes. See, e.g., Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 801, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting), Riley, 252 F.3d at 752-753 (History alone resolves whether the qui tam provisions in the FCA violate Article II). Standing alone, however, historical patterns cannot justify contemporary violations of constitutional guarantees, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 790, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), even when the practice in question covers our entire national existence and indeed predates it, Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 678, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970). Nor is enactment by the First Congress a guarantee of a statute's constitutionality. See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Finally, we should be especially careful not to overread the early history of federal qui tam statutes given that the Constitution's creation of a separate Executive Branch coequal to the Legislature was a structural departure from the English system of parliamentary supremacy, from which  many legal practices like qui tam were inherited. See S. Prakash, The Chief Prosecutor, 73 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 521, 589 (2005) (noting that, for this reason, we ought to be cautious about importing English constraints or exceptions to the executive power, when those limitations might be based on the principle of parliamentary supremacy).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,116,"In short, there is good reason to suspect that Article II does not permit private relators to represent the United States' interests in FCA suits. However, even if that is true, the follow-on implications may not be as straightforward as they appear at first glance. Under the FCA, the relator brings suit for himself as well as for the United States Government. § 3730(b)(1) (emphasis added). In Stevens, we read this language as effecting a partial assignment of the Government's damages claim, which provided the theoretical justification for our holding that a qui tam relator under the FCA has Article III standing. 529 U.S., at 773, 778, 120 S.Ct. 1858. For that holding to make sense, it appears that this assignment must be effective no later than the point in time at which the Government declines to intervene in the seal period and the relator may proceed with the action as the only plaintiff in court.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,117,"Under Stevens' partial-assignment theory, it is not immediately clear that the Government may dismiss the relator's interest in a qui tam suit, even assuming that the relator's representation of the United States' interest is unconstitutional. Whether the Government may do so may depend on the implicit conditions of the assignment, conceivably, it may also depend on whether the assignment is severable from the FCA's attempt to vest the authority to represent the United States in litigation in a party outside the Executive Branch.",Thomas,0,
2022-021,118,"In examining these issues, moreover, it may be necessary to consider a question that Stevens left unaddressed: What is the source of Congress' power to effect partial assignments of the United States' damages claims? One candidate might be the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 18, but, if qui tam suits violate Article II, then it appears unlikely that any assignment effectuated by the FCA's qui tam provisions could be considered necessary and proper for carrying into Execution any constitutional power. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 60, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (To act under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress must select a means not `prohibited' by the Constitution or inconsistent with `the letter and spirit of the Constitution' (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), alteration omitted)). Alternatively, such assignments might rely at least partly on the Property Clause, which empowers Congress to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States, and which may include the power to assign claims for damages as other Property. Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2, see also D. Engdahl, The Basis of the Spending Power, 18 Seattle U. L. Rev. 215, 256-257 (1995) (The Article IV Property Clause is most familiar, of course, in its application to landed property,  but it has been recognized as applying to personal property as well).",Thomas,0,
2022-021,119,"In any event, these are complex questions, which I would leave for the parties and the court below to consider after resolving the statutory issues that have been the focus of this case up to now.3 Therefore,  I would vacate the judgment below granting the Government's motion to dismiss and remand for the Third Circuit to consider the correct disposition of that motion in light of any applicable constitutional requirements.",Thomas,0,
2022-022,27,"In this case, we consider whether a private citizen with influence over government decision-making can be convicted for wire fraud on the theory that he or she deprived the public of its intangible right of honest services. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 1346. Petitioner Joseph Percoco was charged with conspiring to commit honest-services wire fraud during a period of time that included an eight-month interval between two stints as a top aide to the Governor of New York. Percoco was convicted of this offense based on instructions that required the jury to determine whether he had a special relationship with the government and had dominated and controlled government business. 2 App. 511. We conclude that this is not the proper test for determining whether a private person may be convicted of honest-services fraud, and we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.",Alito,0,
2022-022,29,"Percoco was a longtime political associate of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Except for a brief but important hiatus in 2014, Percoco served as the Governor's Executive Deputy Secretary from 2011 to 2016, and that position gave him a wide range of influence over state decision-making. In April 2014, Percoco resigned from this position to manage the Governor's reelection campaign, but after the Governor was reelected, he resumed his role as Executive Deputy Secretary in December 2014.",Alito,0,
2022-022,30,"The question we address today arises from Percoco's activities during his break in government service. In July 2014, Empire State Development (ESD), a state agency, informed developer Steven Aiello that his real-estate company, COR Development, needed to enter into a Labor Peace Agreement with local unions if he wished to receive state funding for a lucrative project. Id., at 597. Interested in avoiding the costs of such an agreement, Aiello reached out to Percoco through an intermediary so that Percoco could help us with this issue while he is off the 2nd floor, i.e., the floor that housed the Governor's office. Id., at 594. Percoco agreed and received two payments totaling $35,000 from Aiello's company in August and October 2014. On December 3, mere days before returning to his old job, Percoco called a senior official at ESD and urged him to drop the labor-peace requirement. ESD promptly reversed course the next day and informed Aiello that the agreement was not necessary.",Alito,0,
2022-022,31,"Percoco's dealings in this and other matters later came to the attention of the United States Department of Justice, which obtained a multi-count indictment against Percoco and others for engaging in several allegedly illegal schemes.1 Percoco was charged with two counts of conspiring to commit honest-services wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 1346, and 1349, two counts of soliciting bribes and gratuities, in violation of § 666(a)(1)(B), and three counts of Hobbs Act extortion, in violation of § 1951. 1 App. 96-103. Only the wire fraud conspiracy count relating to the labor-peace requirement (count 10) is directly at issue before this Court.",Alito,0,
2022-022,32,"That count alleged a conspiracy running from at least in or about 2014, up to and including in or about 2015, that is, both during the time when Percoco was formally employed in the Governor's office and during the period when he was working on the Governor's campaign. See id., at 100 (incorporating ¶4 and ¶¶33-35 of the indictment). Before trial, Percoco moved for dismissal of that count—and another conspiracy count overlapping with the campaign period—on the ground that a private citizen cannot commit or conspire to commit honest-services wire fraud based on his own duty of honest services to the public. See id., at 130, 133. The District Court denied that motion, noting that the indictment alleged that Percoco, while formally working on the Governor's campaign, had `continued to function in a senior advisory and supervisory role with regard to the Governor's Office' and had `continued to be involved in the hiring of staff and the coordination of the Governor's official events and priorities  among other responsibilities.' Id., at 133 (quoting id., at 77, Indictment ¶4).",Alito,0,
2022-022,33,"At trial, the prosecution introduced evidence to support the indictment's allegations about Percoco's activities during his  break in official service, as well as evidence that he had expressed his intent and had made plans to resume official service after the election. See 13 F.4th 180, 201-203 (C.A.2 2021). At the end of the prosecution's case, Percoco again moved for judgment of acquittal on count 10, contending that no evidence showed that he had taken any act in furtherance of that conspiracy while serving in an official government capacity. Id., at 187.",Alito,0,
2022-022,34,"The court reserved decision on that motion, ibid., and the case was submitted to the jury. Over defense counsel's objection, the court instructed that Percoco could be found to have had a duty to provide honest services to the public during the time when he was not serving as a public official if the jury concluded, first, that he dominated and controlled any governmental business and, second, that people working in the government actually relied on him because of a special relationship he had with the government. 2 App. 511. The jury convicted Percoco on count 10, as well as two other charged counts relating to additional conduct, but acquitted him on the other charges. The court then denied Percoco's motion for judgment of acquittal, and he was sentenced to 72 months' imprisonment. 13 F.4th at 187-188.",Alito,0,
2022-022,35,"On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed. The court explained that the fiduciary-duty jury instruction given by the trial judge fit comfortably with, and in fact restated, the understanding of honest-services fraud that the Second Circuit had adopted many years earlier in United States v. Margiotta, 688 F.2d 108 (1982). See 13 F.4th at 194 (noting that Percoco and his co-defendants seem to agree that the district court's fiduciary-duty instruction falls within Margiotta). Based on that precedent, the court also rejected Percoco's claim that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had owed New York State a duty of honest services while he was managing the Governor's campaign. Id., at 201.",Alito,0,
2022-022,36,"Percoco sought this Court's review, asking us to decide whether a private citizen who has informal political or other influence over governmental decisionmaking can be convicted of honest-services fraud. Pet. for Cert. i. We granted certiorari. 597 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2901, 213 L.Ed.2d 1114 (2022).2",Alito,0,
2022-022,39,"As noted, the decision below was based squarely on the Second Circuit's 1982 decision in Margiotta, and we therefore begin by briefly recounting the events that led up to and followed that decision. The federal wire fraud statute, § 1343 (like the older federal mail fraud statute, § 1341), targets the use of certain instrumentalities to advance any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises. Before 1987, all Courts of Appeals had embraced the view that these statutes proscribe what came to be known as honest-services fraud. Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 401, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010). In most of these cases, public employees had accepted a bribe or kickback in exchange for dishonest conduct  that did not necessarily cause their employers to suffer a financial loss, but this conduct was found to constitute mail or wire fraud because it deprived the relevant government unit (and thus, by extension, the public) of the right to receive honest services. See id., at 400-401, 130 S.Ct. 2896.",Alito,0,
2022-022,40,"In Margiotta, the Second Circuit faced a case that departed from this pattern. Joseph Margiotta chaired the Republican Party Committees for Nassau County and the town of Hempstead, New York, and he used the influence that came with those positions to carry out a kickback scheme. He was indicted for honest-services mail fraud, and although he held no elective office, the prosecution argued that he nevertheless breached a duty to render honest services because his party positions afforded him sufficient power and prestige to exert substantial control over public officials. 688 F.2d at 113.",Alito,0,
2022-022,41,"A divided Second Circuit panel agreed. The majority found that there is no precise litmus paper test for determining when a private person owes a fiduciary duty to the general citizenry but that two time-tested measures of fiduciary status were helpful. Id., at 122. These were (1) whether others relied upon the accused because of his special relationship in the government and (2) whether he exercised de facto control over governmental decisions. Ibid. Admitting that the case before it was novel and that determining when a private person owes a duty of honest services was a most difficult enterprise, the majority nevertheless concluded that a private person could commit honest-services fraud if he or she dominated government. Id., at 121-122. In a strongly worded partial dissent, Judge Winter complained that the majority's interpretation lacked the slightest basis in Congressional intent, statutory language or common canons of statutory interpretation and that it erroneously treated a variety of politically active persons who have informal but strong influence over government as subject to the same duties as officeholders. Id., at 142 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).",Alito,0,
2022-022,42,"This Court declined to review the Second Circuit's decision, 461 U. S. 913, 103 S.Ct. 1891, 77 L.Ed.2d 282 (1983), but that decision's life as Second Circuit precedent was short-lived. In McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), the Court considered a similar case, and rather than addressing the application of honest-services fraud to private persons, the Court rejected the entire concept of honest-services fraud and held that the mail fraud statute was limited in scope to the protection of property rights. Id., at 358, 360, 107 S.Ct. 2875.",Alito,0,
2022-022,43,"McNally's holding on honest-services fraud, however, lasted for less time than Margiotta's. Congress responded swiftly and enacted 18 U.S.C. § 1346, which provides that the `the term scheme or artifice to defraud,' which appears in both § 1341 and § 1343, `includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.' Skilling, 561 U.S. at 402, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (quoting § 1346).",Alito,0,
2022-022,44,"Decades later, this Court considered and rejected the broad argument that § 1346 is unconstitutionally vague, and in doing so, clarified the meaning of the phrase the intangible right of honest services. Id., at 402-405, 130 S.Ct. 2896. Noting § 1346's use of `the definite article the' in the phrase the intangible right of honest services, we held that § 1346 covers the core of pre-McNally honest-services case law and did not apply to `all intangible rights of honest services whatever they might be thought to be.' 561 U.S. at 404-405, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (quoting United States  v. Rybicki, 354 F.3d 124, 137-138 (C.A.2 2003) (en banc)). And we observed that in the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. 561 U.S. at 404, 130 S.Ct. 2896. We reasoned that those engaging in such schemes had sufficient reason to know that their conduct was proscribed. Id., at 407, 410, 412, 130 S.Ct. 2896.",Alito,0,
2022-022,45,"Skilling's approach informs our decision in this case. Here, the Second Circuit concluded that Congress effectively reinstated the Margiotta-theory cases by adopting statutory language that covered the theory. 13 F.4th at 196. But Skilling was careful to avoid giving § 1346 an indeterminate breadth that would sweep in any conception of intangible rights of honest services recognized by some courts prior to McNally.",Alito,0,
2022-022,46,"This is illustrated by Skilling's rejection of the Government's argument that § 1346 should be held to reach cases involving `undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee—i.e., the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.' 561 U.S. at 409-410, 130 S.Ct. 2896. Because the pre-McNally lower court decisions involving such conduct were inconsistent, we concluded that this amorphous category of cases did not constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine. 561 U.S. at 410, 130 S.Ct. 2896.",Alito,0,
2022-022,47,"Skilling's teaching is clear. The intangible right of honest services must be defined with the clarity typical of criminal statutes and should not be held to reach an ill-defined category of circumstances simply because of a smattering of pre-McNally decisions. With this lesson in mind, we turn to the question whether the theory endorsed by the lower courts in this case gave § 1346 an uncertain breadth that raises the due process concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine. See 561 U.S. at 408, 130 S.Ct. 2896.",Alito,0,
2022-022,49,"As noted, Percoco moved before trial for dismissal of the honest-services conspiracy count at issue on the ground that he was out of public office during part of the time period within the indictment and that a private citizen cannot be convicted of depriving the public of honest services. See Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion To Dismiss the Superseding Indictment in No. 1:16-cr-00776 (SDNY, May 19, 2017), ECF Doc. 187, pp. 25-30. He advanced a similar theory in his motion for acquittal, emphasizing that he was acting under a short-term agreement with Aiello's firm within the period in which he was no longer a state employee. 1 App. 447.",Alito,0,
2022-022,50,"On this point, Percoco's arguments sweep too broadly. To be sure, the pre-McNally record on honest-services fraud is clearest when the Government seeks to prosecute actual public officials. Most of the pre-McNally honest-services prosecutions, including what appears to be the first case to adopt that theory, involved actual public officials. See Skilling, 561 U.S. at 400-401, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (citing Shushan v. United States, 117 F.2d 110, 115 (C.A.5 1941)). But we reject the argument that a person nominally outside public employment can never have the necessary fiduciary duty to the public. Without becoming a government employee, individuals not formally employed by a government entity may enter into agreements that make them actual agents of the government. An agent owes a fiduciary  obligation to the principal, see, e.g., 1 Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01, Comment e, p. 23 (2005), and therefore an agent of the government has a fiduciary duty to the government and thus to the public it serves. In this Court, Percoco has agreed that individuals who are delegated authority to act on behalf of a public official and to perform government duties have a duty to provide honest services. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, see also Brief for Petitioner 22, 24, 37, Reply Brief 9. This well-established principle suffices to confirm that the lower courts correctly rejected Percoco's per se rule and, in doing so, did not stretch § 1346 past heartland cases. See Skilling, 561 U.S. at 408, 130 S.Ct. 2896.",Alito,0,
2022-022,51,"Rejecting this absolute rule, however, is not enough to sustain Percoco's convictions on the wire fraud conspiracy counts. The intangible right of honest services codified in § 1346 plainly does not extend a duty to the public to all private persons, and whether the correct test was applied in this case returns us to Margiotta.",Alito,0,
2022-022,53,"Percoco challenges the Margiotta theory that underlay the jury instructions in this case, and we must therefore decide whether those instructions are correct. We hold that they are not.",Alito,0,
2022-022,55,"Directly applying Margiotta, the trial judge told the jury that Percoco owed a duty of honest services to the public if (1) he dominated and controlled any governmental business and (2) people working in the government actually relied on him because of a special relationship he had with the government. 2 App. 511, see Margiotta, 688 F.2d at 122. But Margiotta's standard is too vague. From time immemorial, there have been éminence grises, individuals who lacked any formal government position but nevertheless exercised very strong influence over government decisions. Some of these individuals have been reviled, others have been respected as wise counselors. The Margiotta test could be said to apply to many who fell into both of these camps. It could also be used to charge particularly well-connected and effective lobbyists. See 688 F.2d at 142 (opinion of Winter, J.). Margiotta acknowledged that the public has no right to disinterested service from lobbyists and political party officials, but the rule it developed—which was embodied in the jury instructions given in this case—implies that the public does hold such a right whenever such persons' clout exceeds some ill-defined threshold. Id., at 122. Margiotta set a low bar, i.e., the point at which a defendant's influence goes beyond minimum participation in the processes of government. Ibid. The instructions in this case demanded more, viz., proof of domination, but what does that mean in concrete terms? Is it enough if an elected official almost always heeds the advice of a long-time political adviser? Is it enough if an officeholder leans very heavily on recommendations provided by a highly respected predecessor, family member, or old friend? Without further constraint, Margiotta does not (and thus, the jury instructions did not) define the intangible right of honest services `with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited,' or `in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.' McDonnell v. United States, 579 U.S. 550, 576, 136 S.Ct. 2355, 195 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016) (quoting Skilling, 561 U.S. at 402-403, 130 S.Ct. 2896).",Alito,0,
2022-022,57,"The Government does not defend these jury instructions as an accurate statement of the law, but it argues that their imprecision was harmless. Specifically, the Government argues that a private individual owes a duty of honest services to the public in two discrete circumstances: (1) when the person has been selected to work for the government in the future and (2) when the person exercises the functions of a government position with the acquiescence of relevant government personnel. Brief for United States 25, cf. 18 U.S.C. § 201(b) (federal bribery statute incorporating persons selected to be a public official).3",Alito,0,
2022-022,58,"The first theory differs substantially from the jury instructions, which did not tell the jury that Percoco could be found to owe a duty of honest services because he had been selected for future government service. While the prosecution offered evidence that Percoco intended to return to government service after the election and had made plans to do so, the jury could have found that the requirements set out in the jury instructions were satisfied without relying on that evidence. Thus, even if we assume for the sake of argument that there is some merit in the Government's first new theory, it is far from clear that the erroneous jury instructions would be harmless.",Alito,0,
2022-022,59,"The Government's second new theory— i.e., that a private citizen owes a duty to render honest services when the person exercises the functions of a government position with the acquiescence of relevant government personnel—appears, as defined in its brief, to restate Margiotta's erroneous construction of the law. See Brief for United States 33 (instructions as a whole and in the context of this case  correctly conveyed this test). Moreover, the jury was not told that it was necessary to find that relevant government personnel acquiesced in Percoco's exercise of government functions.",Alito,0,
2022-022,60,"In short, the jury instructions are substantially different from either of the Government's new theories, and the Second Circuit—which treated even the language the Government now disclaims in Margiotta as good law—did not affirm on either of these theories.

2022-022,64,"The Court holds that the jury instructions in this case were too vague. Ante, at 1138-1139. I agree. But to my mind, the problem runs deeper than that because no set of instructions could have made things any better. To this day, no one knows what honest-services fraud encompasses. And the Constitution's promise of due process does not tolerate that kind of uncertainty in our laws—especially when criminal sanctions loom. Vague laws impermissibly hand off the legislature's responsibility for defining criminal behavior to unelected prosecutors and judges, and they leave people with no sure  way to know what consequences will attach to their conduct. United States v. Davis, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2319, 2323, 204 L.Ed.2d 757 (2019).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,65,"Honest-services fraud and this Court's vagueness jurisprudence are old friends. The story traces back to the early 1940s when a string of lower courts began stretching the federal mail-fraud statute's phrase scheme or artifice to defraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1341. Everyone understood that the phrase covers efforts to swindle money or property. But some lower courts began suggesting that the phrase also sweeps in schemes to deprive others of intangible rights, including the right to honest services. Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 400, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010) (citing cases). What did this new honest-services fraud concept encompass? Even the lower courts that devised the theory could not agree. They clashed over everything from who owes a duty of honest services to what sources of law may give rise to that duty to what sort of actions constitute a breach of it. See id., at 416-420, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,66,"Eventually, that uncertainty demanded this Court's attention. In McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), the Court held that, while § 1341 clearly protects property rights, it does not protect more abstract interests like a right to honest  government. Id., at 355, 356, 107 S.Ct. 2875. McNally rested, in no small part, on vagueness concerns. Any other interpretation, the Court emphasized, would leave the law's outer boundaries ambiguous. Id., at 360, 107 S.Ct. 2875. If Congress wanted to extend the law to protect more than property rights, the Court added, it must speak more clearly than it has. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,67,"Soon Congress did speak. It enacted § 1346, which now defines the phrase scheme or artifice to defraud to include a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. In one sense, the new law did offer clarity. It dispelled any doubt about whether Congress intended the mail-fraud statute (and later the wire-fraud statute, § 1343) to protect a right to honest services. But in another sense, the law clarified nothing. Congress did not address McNally's concern that the phrase honest-services fraud is unworkably vague. Nothing in the new law attempted to resolve when the duty of honest services arises, what sources of law create that duty, or what amounts to a breach of it. Nor did the new law cross-reference any portion of the federal criminal code that might have lent clarity to the concept.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,68,"These problems resurfaced in Skilling. There, a majority of the Court acknowledged that a vagueness challenge to § 1346 had force. 561 U.S. at 405, 130 S.Ct. 2896. But instead of throwing out the statute as irremediably vague, the majority elected to fill in some of the blanks. Id., at 403-404, 130 S.Ct. 2896. To that end, the majority looked to the doctrine of honest-services fraud as it had developed in the lower courts in pre-McNally cases. Id., at 404, 130 S.Ct. 2896. Recognizing the many internal tensions in that line of cases, the majority attempted to pare that body of precedent down to its core. Ibid. What exactly falls within that core? The majority could not say. All it could muster was that, in the main, honest-services convictions had involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,69,"Justice SCALIA, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice THOMAS declined to participate  in Skilling's rescue mission. They saw the Court's decision as an act of not interpretation but invention. Id., at 422, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Nothing in the statute, they observed, confined breaches of the duty of honest services to bribes or kickbacks. Indeed, not a single lower court had understood the concept to be limited in that way. Id., at 423, 130 S.Ct. 2896. Nor could the dissenters find anything in the judicial power permitting them to replace a vague criminal standard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (included within the vague one). Id., at 422, 130 S.Ct. 2896.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,70,"Even on its own terms, the dissenters noted, the majority's reconstruction of the statute failed to eliminate its vagueness. Id., at 421, 130 S.Ct. 2896. The majority had not attempted to define what constitutes a breach of the `honest services' obligation, but sought to identify only conduct that fell within its core. Ibid. Nor had the majority done anything to solve the most fundamental indeterminacy in honest-services-fraud theory, ibid., for nothing in its decision explained what kinds of fiduciary relationships are sufficient to trigger a duty of honest services in the first place. Is the duty of honest services limited to public officials serving the government? Ibid. Does it also apply to private individuals who contract with the public? Ibid. Or does it apply to everyone who owes some sort of fiduciary responsibility to others, including (say) a corporate officer? Ibid. What source of law, too, should a court consult to answer these questions? Must a fiduciary duty arise from positive state or federal law, or can it arise from general trust law, a corpus juris festooned with various duties? Id., at 417-418, 130 S.Ct. 2896. All these questions, the dissenters observed, had long divided lower courts and remained unanswered.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,71,"Today, the Court returns to these quandaries. The jury instructions in this case sought to identify at least one instance when a duty of honest services arises— namely, when a private individual has `dominated and controlled any governmental business' and `people working in the government actually relied on him because of a special relationship he had with the government.' Ante, at 1138. But that formulation, the Court holds, is too vague to pass constitutional muster. Ante, at 1138-1139. That is so, the Court reasons, because it could result in the conviction of anyone whose clout exceeds some ill-defined threshold and thus sweep in effective lobbyists exercising their First Amendment right to petition the government. Ibid. The Court also pauses briefly to address two alternative tests the government suggests for defining when a duty of honest services may attach. But the Court takes no view on the first and rejects the second. Ante, at 1139. In the end, we may now know a little bit more about when a duty of honest services does not arise, but we still have no idea when it does.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,72,"It's a situation that leaves prosecutors and lower courts in a bind. They must continue guessing what kind of fiduciary relationships this Court will find sufficient to give rise to a duty of honest services. For them, it is back to the drawing board in their indictments and their jury instructions. But they are not the main victims here. That plight belongs to private citizens. In this country, a criminal law is supposed to provide ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes. Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 595, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), see also Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). Yet even 80 years after lower courts began experimenting with the honest-services-fraud theory, no one can say  what sort of fiduciary relationship is enough to sustain a federal felony conviction and decades in federal prison.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,73,"To be sure, I cannot fault the Court for the problem. The difficulty here stems from the statute and the lower court decisions that inspired it. I have no doubt that if all nine Justices put our heads together, we could rewrite § 1346 to provide fair notice and minimize the risk of uneven enforcement. I have no doubt, too, that we could find a hook for any such rule somewhere in the morass of pre-McNally lower-court case law. Maybe, too, that is the path we are on, effectively writing this law bit by bit in decisions spanning decades with the help of prosecutors and lower courts who present us with one option after another. But that is not a path the Constitution tolerates. Under our system of separated powers, the Legislative Branch must do the hard work of writing federal criminal laws. Congress cannot give the Judiciary uncut marble with instructions to chip away all that does not resemble David. See United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 221, 23 L.Ed. 563 (1876) (It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large), United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820) (MARSHALL, C. J.) (It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-022,74,"Doubtless, Congress had high and worthy intentions when it enacted § 1346. But it must do more than invoke an aspirational phrase and leave it to prosecutors and judges to make things up as they go along. The Legislature must identify the conduct it wishes to prohibit. And its prohibition must be knowable in advance—not a lesson to be learned by individuals only when the prosecutor comes calling or the judge debuts a novel charging instruction. Perhaps Congress will someday set things right by revising § 1346 to provide the clarity it desperately needs. Until then, this Court should decline further invitations to invent rather than interpret this law.",Gorsuch,0,

Ibid. Nothing about § 2409a(g)'s text or context gives reason to depart from this beaten path. Section 2409a(g) states that an action shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued. This text speaks only to a claim's timeliness, and its mundane statute-of-limitations language says only what every time bar, by definition, must: that after a certain time a claim is barred. Id., at 410, 135 S.Ct. 1625. Further, this Court has often explained that Congress's separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant indicates that the time bar is not jurisdictional. Id., at 411, 135 S.Ct. 1625. The Quiet Title Act's jurisdictional grant is in 28 U.S.C. § 1346(f),4 well afield of § 2409a(g). And nothing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the limitations period, or otherwise links those separate provisions. Wong, 575 U.S. at 412, 135 S.Ct. 1625.

Block described the Act's time limit as a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity. 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811. Block never stated, however, that the Act's time limit was therefore truly a limit on subject-matter jurisdiction. Yet according to the Government and the dissent, this went without saying because the case law at the time was unmistakably clear that conditions on waivers of immunity were subject-matter jurisdictional. Post, at 885-886.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,48,"This reading is undermined by the very history on which it draws. In Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), the Court surveyed the case law about whether time limits in suits against the Government are subject to equitable tolling, waiver, and estoppel. Id., at 94, 111 S.Ct. 453. If associating time limits with waivers of sovereign immunity clearly made those limits jurisdictional, equitable exceptions would be just as clearly foreclosed. Instead, Irwin described the Court's approach to this question as ad hoc and unpredictable, leaving open whether equitable exceptions were available in any given case. Id., at 94-95, 111 S.Ct. 453. Accordingly, even if a statute of limitations was a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity and thus must be strictly construed, this still did not answer the question whether equitable tolling can be applied to this statute of limitations. Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467, 479, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986). The Court instead analyzed the specific statutory scheme at issue, with varying results. Ibid. (citing Honda v. Clark, 386 U.S. 484, 87 S.Ct. 1188, 18 L.Ed.2d 244 (1967)).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,49,"Block itself reflected the ambivalent nature of time limits for suits against the Government. Block recognized that we should not construe such a time-bar  provision unduly restrictively, 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811, which the Court quoted just a few years later in support of the proposition that some such limits are subject to equitable tolling, Bowen, 476 U.S. at 479, 106 S.Ct. 2022, see also Irwin, 498 U.S. at 94, 111 S.Ct. 453. Similarly, while Block cautioned that exceptions to such time limits will not be lightly implied, it did not hold they were categorically precluded. 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811. Block thus acknowledged nothing more than a general proposition, echoed by Irwin, that a condition to the waiver of sovereign immunity  must be strictly construed. Irwin, 498 U.S. at 94, 111 S.Ct. 453. In Irwin, as elsewhere, this did not mean that time limits accompanying such waivers are necessarily jurisdictional.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,50,"Next, the Government offers United States v. Mottaz, 476 U.S. 834, 106 S.Ct. 2224, 90 L.Ed.2d 841 (1986). Once again, the question presented was not whether the Quiet Title Act's 12-year time limit was technically jurisdictional. The Court instead had to decide which of two possible statutory time bars applied. Id., at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224. This analysis proceeded in two steps. First, the Court asked which of several federal statutes—the Quiet Title Act, the Allotment Acts, or the Tucker Act—was the source of  jurisdiction based on the nature of the plaintiff's claim and the relief sought. Ibid. (citations omitted). The Court explained that the Quiet Title Act applied because it was `the exclusive means by which adverse claimants could challenge the United States' title to real property,' and the plaintiff's claim fell within the Act's scope. Id., at 841-842, 106 S.Ct. 2224 (quoting Block, 461 U.S. at 286, 103 S.Ct. 1811). Second, the Court then determined whether the suit was brought within the relevant limitations period. Mottaz, 476 U.S. at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224. The Court concluded that the plaintiff had notice over 12 years before she sued, and her claim was therefore barred. Id., at 843-844, 106 S.Ct. 2224. Neither step in the Court's analysis turned on whether any time limits were `technically jurisdictional.' Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 512, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (quoting Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 91, 118 S.Ct. 1003).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,51,"General statements in the opinion about waivers of immunity cannot change this basic fact. At the outset of its analysis, the Court observed that the terms of the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity define the extent of the court's jurisdiction and that `a statute of limitations constitutes a condition on the waiver.' Mottaz, 476 U.S. at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224 (quoting Block, 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811). Neither of these statements, however, played a role in determining which statute applied or whether the plaintiff brought her claim within 12 years after it accrued. There is also no indication in the opinion that the parties raised tolling or other equitable exceptions. As such, `the legal character' of the time limit was never `at issue.' Reed Elsevier, 559 U.S. at 169, n. 8, 130 S.Ct. 1237 (quoting Zipes, 455 U.S. at 395, 102 S.Ct. 1127).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,52,"The Government also points to Mottaz's procedural background section. Buried in a paragraph recounting a tangled procedural history, the Court remarked that the Government raised the Quiet Title Act, apparently for the first time, in a petition for rehearing. 476 U.S. at 840, 106 S.Ct. 2224. This supposedly reveals that the Court sua sponte and sub silentio raised, considered, and rejected an argument that the Government had forfeited the Quiet Title Act's time limit, doing so all because the time limit was jurisdictional. Yet a background section is an unlikely place for such a ruling. This is particularly true where, as the word apparently indicates, the Court did not pause over its passing  remark. Nor did the Court mention this again. Further, even if the Court had secretly considered forfeiture, there were nonjurisdictional reasons the Court could have concluded forfeiture did not apply.5 Speculating about what this Court might have thought about arguments it never addressed needlessly introduces confusion. This Court looks for definitive interpretations, not holdings in hiding.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,53,"Finally, there is United States v. Beggerly, 524 U.S. 38, 118 S.Ct. 1862, 141 L.Ed.2d 32 (1998). The Court in Beggerly addressed whether § 2409a(g) could be equitably tolled. Id., at 48-49, 118 S.Ct. 1862. Subject-matter jurisdiction, as noted, is never subject to equitable tolling. If Block and Mottaz had definitely interpreted § 2409a(g) as subject-matter jurisdictional, the Court could have just cited those cases and ended the matter without further discussion.6 Instead, the Court parsed the provision's text and context, concluding that by providing that the statute of limitations will not begin to run until the plaintiff `knew or should have known of the claim of the United States,' the law has already effectively allowed for equitable tolling. Beggerly, 524 U.S. at 48, 118 S.Ct. 1862. Also relevant were the unusually generous time limit and the importance of clarity when it comes to land rights. Id., at 48-49, 118 S.Ct. 1862. This careful analysis of whether the text and context were consistent with equitable tolling would have been wasted words if the Court had already held that § 2409a(g) was jurisdictional. Precisely because the Court's inquiry was so focused on the particular nature of equitable tolling, Beggerly also did not address whether other exceptions such as fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel might apply, as Justice Stevens noted in his concurrence. Id., at 49, 118 S.Ct. 1862. If anything, Beggerly's discussion of nonjurisdictional reasons why tolling specifically was unavailable indicates the Court understood § 2409a(g) not to be jurisdictional. Thus, Beggerly undermines any notion that Block and Mottaz had put the jurisdictional question to rest.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-023,54,"All three cases therefore point in one direction: This Court has never definitively interpreted § 2409a(g) as jurisdictional.7 For similar reasons, the Government's argument about legislative acquiescence is unavailing. Congress amended the Act in 1986 to provide special rules for States in the wake of Block. See 100 Stat. 3351-3352. Then, as now, none of our decisions established that the time limit was jurisdictional, so there was no definitive judicial interpretation to which Congress could acquiesce. Alexander v.

Nor can the Government's handful of lower court opinions stand in for a ruling of this Court, especially where some of these decisions contain only fleeting references to jurisdiction.8 See Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1499-1500.",Sotomayor,0,

2022-023,60,"The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars suits against the United States. But, in the Quiet Title Act of 1972, Congress waived this immunity and consented to suits against the United States in order to determine the status of disputed property. 28 U.S.C. § 2409a. Congress conditioned this consent on, among other things, a 12-year statute of limitations: Any civil action under this section, except for an action brought by a State, shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued. § 2409a(g). This Court has long construed such conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity as jurisdictional. And, it has acknowledged the jurisdictional nature of the Quiet Title Act's statute of limitations in several precedents.",Thomas,0,

First, it applies the same interpretive approach to a condition on a waiver of sovereign immunity that it would apply to any run-of-the-mill procedural rule.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.",Thomas,0,
2022-023,63,"This Court's skepticism of the jurisdictional character of procedural bars does not extend to conditions on a waiver of sovereign immunity. In the context of a waiver of sovereign immunity, the Court presumes that procedural limitations are jurisdictional. The Act's time bar is one such provision, and, as such, this Court should interpret it as a jurisdictional bar to suit.",Thomas,0,
2022-023,64,"As a sovereign, the United States is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued,  and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit. United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941), see also Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 160, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981), United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) (describing this principle as axiomatic). Consequently, sovereign immunity is by nature jurisdictional. Henderson v.

2022-023,66,"A necessary corollary of this rule, however, is that when Congress attaches conditions to legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United States, those conditions must be strictly observed, and exceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.

Thus, in many cases this Court has read procedural rules embodied in statutes waiving immunity strictly, with an eye to effectuating a restrictive legislative purpose when Congress relinquishes sovereign immunity. Honda v. Clark, 386 U.S. 484, 501, 87 S.Ct. 1188, 18 L.Ed.2d 244 (1967). In United States v. Dalm, 494 U.S. 596, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), the Court reaffirmed this settled principle in the specific context of a statute of limitations requiring that a suit against the Government be brought within a certain time period. Id., at 608, 110 S.Ct. 1361. Such a requirement, the Court explained, is one of the terms of the United States' consent to be sued and, therefore, defines the court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Ibid. (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-023,67,"Those straightforward principles resolve this case. The Quiet Title Act partially waives the immunity of the United States by granting federal district courts exclusive original jurisdiction of civil actions under section 2409a to quiet title to an estate or interest in real property in which an interest is claimed by the United States. 28 U.S.C. § 1346(f). This provision's cross-reference to § 2409a incorporates several conditions on this waiver. For example, the Act specifies that the United States shall not be disturbed in possession or control of contested land pending a final judgment or decree, the conclusion of any appeal therefrom, and sixty days, and if the final determination is adverse, the United States shall have the right to purchase the land for just compensation. § 2409a(b). Similarly, the Act provides that any civil action against the United States under this section shall be tried by the court without a jury and bars suits based on adverse possession. §§ 2409a(f), (n). It also incorporates the time bar at issue here: Any civil action under this section, except for an action brought by a State, shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued. Such action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States. § 2409a(g).",Thomas,0,
2022-023,68,"These provisions carefully delineate the scope of the Act's limited waiver of sovereign immunity, establishing conditions on which the United States has consented to be sued.

Similarly, and just as critically, it has not consented to be sued (except by a State) once the 12-year statute of limitations has passed.",Thomas,0,
2022-023,69,"The majority acknowledges that these restrictions must be strictly construed. See ante, at 878-879. Yet, it concludes that the time bar should not be considered jurisdictional.

Irwin considered whether equitable tolling should apply to the time to file an employment-discrimination lawsuit against the Government under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, the Court reasoned that time requirements in lawsuits between private litigants are customarily subject to `equitable tolling,' and that once Congress has made  a waiver of sovereign immunity,  making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the Government, in the same way that it is applicable to private suits, amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver. Irwin, 498 U.S. at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453. It thus concluded that such a principle is likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically useful principle of interpretation. Ibid.",Thomas,0,

Williams, 514 U.S. 527, 115 S.Ct. 1611, 131 L.Ed.2d 608 (1995), decided five years after Irwin, demonstrates that statutes of limitations in suits brought against the United States are no less jurisdictional now than they were before Irwin. In Williams, the Court cited Dalm's holding that failure to file a claim against the Government for a federal tax refund within the statute-of-limitations period operates as a jurisdictional bar to suit, and the Court reaffirmed that a statute of limitations narrows the waiver of sovereign immunity. 514 U.S. at 534, n. 7, 115 S.Ct. 1611 (citing 494 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 1361).1 Irwin, thus, does not disrupt this Court's long held understanding that conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity are presumptively jurisdictional.",Thomas,0,

2022-023,77,"Block considered whether the Act's statute of limitations applied to state litigants.2 There, the Government had argued that the plaintiffs' failure to sue within the 12-year deadline established by the statute meant that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' claims. Brief for the Petitioners in Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, O. T. 1982, No. 812337, p. 5. In assessing this argument, the Court made clear that it understood the Act's statute of limitations to arise in the context of a waiver of sovereign immunity, discussing at some length the tradeoffs proposed as Congress deliberated over the scope of the Act. See 461 U.S. at 280-285, 103 S.Ct. 1811. The Court also prominently invoked Sherwood and Lehman, cases discussing the jurisdictional nature of sovereign-immunity waivers, to explain why the limitations provision must be strictly observed. Block, 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811. After concluding that States were not exempt from the time bar, the Court stated that, if North Dakota's suit is barred by the statute of limitations, the courts below had no jurisdiction to inquire into the merits, and it remanded for the lower courts to determine whether the suit was so barred. Id., at 292-293, 103 S.Ct. 1811. This statement that the time bar went to jurisdiction was an integral part of the Court's instructions on remand. Moreover, on remand, the Eighth Circuit understood the Court to have used the term jurisdiction to refer to a court's authority to hear the case. See North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands v. Block, 789 F.2d 1308, 1310 (C.A.8 1986) (noting that neither the Eighth Circuit nor the District Court had `jurisdiction to inquire into the merits' because the Act's statute of limitations is jurisdictional).",Thomas,0,
2022-023,78,"In Mottaz, three years after Block, the Court again considered the jurisdictional nature of the Act's time bar. In the lower courts, the Government initially defended against a somewhat opaque set of claims by relying on the general 6-year statute of limitations for actions against the United States, 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a). Mottaz, 476 U.S. at 839, 106 S.Ct. 2224. The District Court held that the suit was time barred under § 2401(a), but the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded. Id., at 838-839, 106 S.Ct. 2224. The Government then argued, for the first time, in its petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals that the suit arose under the Quiet Title Act and was thus subject to the Act's 12-year statute of limitations. Id., at 840-841, 106 S.Ct. 2224. This Court granted certiorari to consider whether the respondent's claim was barred under either the 6-year bar  or the 12-year bar. Id., at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224.",Thomas,0,
2022-023,79,"In addressing these, the Court cited Sherwood for the proposition that, when the United States consents to be sued, the terms of its waiver of sovereign immunity define the extent of the court's jurisdiction. 476 U.S. at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224. It then quoted Block for the proposition that `when waiver legislation contains a statute of limitations, the limitations provision constitutes a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity,' treating Block as precedential on this point. 476 U.S. at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224. The Court also characterized the statute of limitations as a central condition of the consent given by the Act. Id., at 843, 106 S.Ct. 2224 (citing Block, 461 U.S. at 283-285, 103 S.Ct. 1811). As in Block, this reasoning was a critical and substantial part of the Court's opinion. The Court ultimately concluded that the plaintiff's claim was untimely and thus barred under the Act. 476 U.S. at 844, 106 S.Ct. 2224. The Court further concluded that no other statute conferred jurisdiction on the lower courts to adjudicate her claim. Id., at 841, 106 S.Ct. 2224, see also id., 844-851, 106 S.Ct. 2224. In deciding the case, the Court noticeably did not engage in a forfeiture analysis, underscoring that it understood the Government's late-raised statute-of-limitations argument to be jurisdictional and, thus, capable of being raised at any point in the proceedings. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (explaining that jurisdictional arguments cannot be forfeited).3",Thomas,0,

In that case, the Court considered whether the Quiet Title Act's time bar may be equitably tolled. After noting that the Court of Appeals had considered the statute of limitations jurisdictional, see Beggerly, 524 U.S. at 42, 118 S.Ct. 1862, the Court turned to the language of the Act. The Court emphasized that the 12-year statute of limitations began to accrue when the litigants knew or should have known of the claim of the United States, and it observed that the provision's text has already effectively allowed for equitable tolling. Id., at 48, 118 S.Ct. 1862 (citing Irwin, 498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. 453). Given this fact, and the unusually generous nature of the Act's limitations time period, the Court concluded that extension of the statutory period by additional equitable tolling would be unwarranted. 524 U.S. at 48-49, 118 S.Ct. 1862. Thus, while Beggerly might be read to view the Act's time bar as potentially susceptible to tolling (and thus, by inference, nonjurisdictional), the Court did not hold that the bar actually could be tolled. Rather, the Court held the opposite. Beggerly is therefore, at best, ambiguous with respect to the jurisdictional nature of the time bar.

A court in the 1980s discussing a provision of a statute as a waiver of sovereign immunity, citing Sherwood (and, later, Block), invoked a well-known set of ideas that readers at the time unmistakably associated with the concept of jurisdiction. In fact, the Court in Dalm cited Block and Mottaz—and no other cases— for the proposition that conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity define the court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit. 494 U.S. at 608, 110 S.Ct. 1301 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).

2022-024,30,"This case begins with then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's Buffalo Billion initiative. On its face, the initiative was administered through Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, a nonprofit affiliated with the State University of New York (SUNY) and the SUNY Research Foundation. It aimed to invest $1 billion in development projects in upstate New York. Later investigations, however, uncovered a wide-ranging scheme that involved several of former Governor Cuomo's associates, most notably Alain Kaloyeros and Todd Howe. Kaloyeros was a member of Fort Schuyler's board of directors and was in charge of developing project proposals for Buffalo Billion, Howe was a lobbyist who had deep ties to the Cuomo administration. Each month, Kaloyeros paid Howe $25,000 in state funds to ensure that the Cuomo administration gave Kaloyeros a prominent position in Buffalo Billion.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,31,"Ciminelli had a similar arrangement. His construction company, LPCiminelli, paid Howe $100,000 to $180,000 each year to help it obtain state-funded jobs. In 2013, Howe and Kaloyeros devised a scheme whereby Kaloyeros would tailor Fort Schuyler's bid process to smooth the way for LPCiminelli to receive major Buffalo Billion contracts. First, on Kaloyeros' suggestion, Fort Schuyler established a process for selecting preferred developers that would be given the first opportunity to negotiate with Fort Schuyler for specific projects. Then, Kaloyeros, Howe, and Ciminelli jointly developed a set of requests for proposal (RFPs) that treated unique aspects of LPCiminelli as qualifications for preferred-developer status. Those RFPs effectively guaranteed that LPCiminelli would be (and was) selected as a preferred developer for the Buffalo projects. With that status in hand, LPCiminelli secured the marquee $750 million Riverbend project in Buffalo.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,32,"After an investigation revealed their scheme, Ciminelli, Howe, Kaloyeros, and several others were indicted by a federal grand jury on 18 counts including, as relevant here, wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of § 1349.",Thomas,0,

The Government's indictment and trial strategy rested solely on that theory.1 And, it successfully defeated Ciminelli and his codefendants' motion to dismiss by relying on that theory. In addition, it successfully moved the District Court to exclude certain defense evidence as irrelevant to that theory. The Government also relied on that theory in its summation to the jury.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,34,"Consistent with the right-to-control theory, the District Court instructed the jury that the term property in § 1343 includes intangible interests such as the right to control the use of one's assets. App. 41. The jury could thus find that the  defendants harmed Fort Schuyler's right to control its assets if Fort Schuyler was deprived of potentially valuable economic information that it would consider valuable in deciding how to use its assets. Ibid. The District Court further defined economically valuable information as information that affects the victim's assessment of the benefits or burdens of a transaction, or relates to the quality of goods or services received or the economic risks of the transaction.

2022-024,39,"The wire fraud statute criminalizes schemes or artifices to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises. § 1343. Although the statute is phrased in the disjunctive, we have consistently understood the money or property requirement to limit the scheme or artifice to defraud element because the common understanding of the words to defraud when the statute was enacted referred to wronging one in his property rights. Cleveland, 531 U.S. at 19, 121 S.Ct. 365 (internal quotation marks omitted).2 This understanding reflects not only the original meaning of the text, but also that the fraud statutes do not vest a general power in the Federal Government to enforce (its view of) integrity in broad swaths of state and local policymaking. Kelly v. United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1565, 1574, 206 L.Ed.2d 882 (2020). Instead, these statutes protect property rights only. Cleveland, 531 U.S. at 19, 121 S.Ct. 365. Accordingly, the Government must prove not only that wire fraud defendants engaged in deception, but also that money or property was an object of their fraud. Kelly, 590 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1571 (alterations omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-024,40,"Despite these limitations, lower federal courts for decades interpreted the mail and wire fraud statutes to protect intangible interests unconnected to traditional property rights. See Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 400, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010) (recounting how the Courts of Appeals, one after another, interpreted the term `scheme or artifice to defraud' to include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights). For example, federal courts held the fraud statutes reached such intangible interests as the right to honest services, ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted),  the right of the citizenry to an honest election, see United States v. Girdner, 754 F.2d 877, 880 (C.A.10 1985), and the right to privacy, United States v. Louderman, it, 576 F.2d 1383, 1387 (C.A.9 1978). In McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), this Court halted that trend by confining the federal fraud statutes to their original station, the protection of individual property rights. Id., at 359, n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 2875. Congress then amended the fraud statutes specifically to cover one of the `intangible rights' that lower courts had protected under the statutes prior to McNally: `the intangible right of honest services.' Cleveland, 531 U.S. at 19-20, 121 S.Ct. 365 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1346).",Thomas,0,
2022-024,41,"The right-to-control theory applied below first arose after McNally prevented the Government from basing federal fraud convictions on harms to intangible interests unconnected to property. See United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 461-464 (C.A.2 1991). As developed by the Second Circuit, the theory holds that, since a defining feature of most property is the right to control the asset in question, the property interests protected by the wire fraud statute include the interest of a victim in controlling his or her own assets. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 48 (2019) (alterations omitted). Thus, a cognizable harm occurs where the defendant's scheme denies the victim the right to control its assets by depriving it of information necessary to make discretionary economic decisions. United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 570 (C.A.2 2015) (alterations omitted).3",Thomas,0,
2022-024,42,"The right-to-control theory cannot be squared with the text of the federal fraud statutes, which are limited in scope to the protection of property rights. McNally, 483 U.S. at 360, 107 S.Ct. 2875. The so-called right to control is not an interest that had long been recognized as property when the wire fraud statute was enacted. Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 26, 108 S.Ct. 316, 98 L.Ed.2d 275 (1987). Significantly, when the Second Circuit first recognized the right-to-control theory in 1991—decades after the wire fraud statute was enacted and over a century after the mail fraud statute was enacted—it could cite no authority that established potentially valuable economic information as a traditionally recognized property interest. See Wallach, 935 F.2d at 462-463.4 And, the Second Circuit has  not since attempted to ground the right-to-control theory in traditional property notions. We have consistently rejected such federal fraud theories that stray from traditional concepts of property. Cleveland, 531 U.S. at 24, 121 S.Ct. 365. For its part, the Government—despite relying upon the right-to-control theory for decades, including in this very case—now concedes that if the right to make informed decisions about the disposition of one's assets, without more, were treated as the sort of `property' giving rise to wire fraud, it would risk expanding the federal fraud statutes beyond property fraud as defined at common law and as Congress would have understood it. Brief for United States 25-26. Thus, even the Government now agrees that the Second Circuit's right-to-control theory is unmoored from the federal fraud statutes' text.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,43,"The right-to-control theory is also inconsistent with the structure and history of the federal fraud statutes. As recounted above, after McNally put an end to federal courts' use of mail and wire fraud to protect an ever-growing swath of intangible interests unconnected to property, Congress responded by enacting § 1346, which—despite the wide array of intangible rights courts protected under the fraud statutes pre-McNally—revived only the intangible right of honest services. Cleveland, 531 U.S. at 19-20, 121 S.Ct. 365 (emphasis added). Congress' reverberating silence about other such intangible interests forecloses the expansion of the wire fraud statute to cover the intangible right to control. United States v. Sadler, 750 F.3d 585, 591 (C.A.6 2014).",Thomas,0,
2022-024,44,"Finally, the right-to-control theory vastly expands federal jurisdiction without statutory authorization. Because the theory treats mere information as the protected interest, almost any deceptive act could be criminal. See, e.g., United States v. Viloski, 557 Fed.Appx. 28 (C.A.2 2014) (affirming right-to-control conviction based on an employee's undisclosed conflict of interest). The theory thus makes a federal crime of an almost limitless variety of deceptive actions traditionally left to state contract and tort law—in flat contradiction with our caution that, absent a clear statement by Congress, courts should not read the mail and wire fraud statutes to place under federal superintendence a vast array of conduct traditionally policed by the States. Cleveland, 531 U.S. at 27, 121 S.Ct. 365. And, as it did below, the Second Circuit has employed the theory to affirm federal convictions regulating the ethics (or lack thereof) of state employees and contractors—despite our admonition that federal prosecutors may not use property fraud statutes to set standards of disclosure and good government for state and local officials. Kelly, 590 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct. at 1574 (alterations omitted). The right-to-control theory thus criminalizes traditionally civil matters and federalizes traditionally state matters.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,45,"In sum, the wire fraud statute reaches only traditional property interests. The right to valuable economic information needed to make discretionary economic decisions is not a traditional property interest. Accordingly, the right-to-control theory cannot form the basis for a conviction under the federal fraud statutes.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,47,"Despite indicting, obtaining convictions, and prevailing on appeal based solely on the right-to-control theory, the Government  now concedes that the theory as articulated below is erroneous. Brief for United States 24-26. The Government frankly admits that, to the extent that language in the Second Circuit's opinions might suggest that depriving a victim of economically valuable information, without more, necessarily qualifies as `obtaining money or property' within the meaning of the fraud statutes, that is incorrect. Id., at 24. That should be the end of the case.",Thomas,0,
2022-024,48,"Yet, the Government insists that its concession does not require reversal because we can affirm Ciminelli's convictions on the alternative ground that the evidence was sufficient to establish wire fraud under a traditional property-fraud theory. Id., at 31-32. With profuse citations to the records below, the Government asks us to cherry-pick facts presented to a jury charged on the right-to-control theory and apply them to the elements of a different wire fraud theory in the first instance. In other words, the Government asks us to assume not only the function of a court of first view, but also of a jury. That is not our role. See, e.g., McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257, 270-271, n. 8, 111 S.Ct. 1807, 114 L.Ed.2d 307 (1991) (Appellate courts are not permitted to affirm convictions on any theory they please simply because the facts necessary to support the theory were presented to the jury), Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 236, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980). Accordingly, we decline the Government's request to affirm Ciminelli's convictions on alternative grounds.",Thomas,0,

The agreement did not actually designate any assignees, it simply meant that, if Transform duly designated an assignee, Sears had to assign the lease to the designee.

The Bankruptcy Court disagreed and approved the assignment to Transform, in a decision that, like the lower courts, we will call the Assignment Order.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,39,"Here is where § 363(m) entered the picture. MOAC feared that, if it appealed the Assignment Order, Transform might argue that § 363(m)'s restrictions limited or barred the appeal.2 Looking to § 363(m)'s safe harbor for certain orders that are stayed pending appeal, MOAC sought to forestall any such argument by asking for a stay of the Assignment Order. The Bankruptcy Court denied MOAC's request for a stay. The court reasoned that an appeal of the Assignment Order did not qualify as an appeal of an authorization  described in § 363(m), and it emphasized that Transform had explicitly represented that it would not invoke § 363(m) against MOAC's appeal. Because no stay was granted, the Assignment Order became effective, and Sears duly assigned the lease to Transform.",Jackson,0,

Brief for Respondent 19. Transform asserts that such reconstitution is impossible unless the leasehold transfer is avoided under 11 U.S.C. § 549, which permits a debtor in possession to void certain transfers of estate property made after the bankruptcy case commences. But, according to Transform, only Sears can use § 549. And, per Transform, not only did Sears waive any such avoidance claims in the Sale Order, but the time for using § 549 has now expired. The upshot for Transform's mootness argument is that no legal vehicle remains available for undoing the lease transfer, and therefore MOAC cannot possibly obtain any effectual relief, irrespective of our answer to the question presented.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,45,"Our cases disfavor these kinds of mootness arguments. In Chafin, for example, a mother invoking the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction sought, and received, an order from a Federal District Court that her child be returned to Scotland from the United States, where the child was residing with her father. 568 U.S. at 168-171, 133 S.Ct. 1017. The father appealed, seeking reversal and a concomitant `re-return' order, id., at 171, 173, 133 S.Ct. 1017, but in the interim the mother had removed the child to Scotland, so the appellate court dismissed the father's appeal as moot. Id., at 171, 133 S.Ct. 1017. Before us, the mother defended the mootness holding on the grounds that the District Court on remand would lack the authority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pursuant to its inherent equitable powers. Id., at 174, 133 S.Ct. 1017. We disagreed. We said her argument went to the meaning of the Convention and the legal availability of a certain kind of relief, and thus confused mootness with the merits. Ibid. And, at least where the father's contrary re-return argument was not so implausible that it was insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, his prospects of success were therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry. Ibid. (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)).",Jackson,0,

And we cannot say that the parties have no `concrete interest,' id., at 176, 133 S.Ct. 1017, in whether MOAC obtains that relief. Transform's only retort —which MOAC vigorously disputes—is simply that any ultimate vacatur of the Assignment Order will not matter. Chafin forecloses this kind of argument. Here, as elsewhere, we decline to act as a court of `first view,' plumbing the Code's complex depths in `the first instance' to assure ourselves that Transform is correct about its contention that no relief remains legally available.

2022-025,58,"Start with the text. Far from addressing `a court's authority,' or `referring in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,' Fort Bend County, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1851, § 363(m) takes as a given the exercise of judicial power over any authorization under § 363(b) or § 363(c) (hereinafter called covered authorizations). Indeed, § 363(m) plainly contemplates that appellate courts might reverse or modify any covered authorization, with a proviso: Sometimes, the court's exercise of power may not accomplish all the appellant wishes, because the reversal or modification of a covered authorization may not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to a good-faith purchaser or lessee under certain prescribed circumstances. § 363(m). Thus, the provision consists of a caveated constraint on the effect of a reversal or modification. And the caveat is itself caveated, § 363(m)'s constraints are simply inapplicable where the sale or lease was made to a bad-faith purchaser or lessee, or if the sale or lease is stayed pending appeal, or (for that matter) if the court does something other than reverse or modify the authorization. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,59,"This is not the stuff of which clear statements are made. Indeed, we treated similar statutory traits as significant evidence of nonjurisdictional status in Reed Elsevier, 559 U.S. at 165, 130 S.Ct. 1237. In Reed Elsevier, this Court considered a Copyright Act provision that, with certain exceptions, required copyright-infringement plaintiffs to show, as a condition to suit, that the work at issue had been registered. Id., at 157-158, 130 S.Ct. 1237. We found that the provision was nonjurisdictional, and thought it key that the provision expressly envisioned courts adjudicating some claims even absent registration, id., at 165, 130 S.Ct. 1237, since it would have been at least unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a condition subject to these sorts of exceptions, ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,60,"Similarly, given § 363(m)'s clear expectation that courts will exercise jurisdiction over a covered authorization, it is surely permissible to read its text as merely cloaking certain good-faith purchasers or lessees with a targeted protection of their newly acquired property interest, applicable even when an appellate court properly exercises jurisdiction. See Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 414, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (statutory provision was not jurisdictional, for it did not speak to the `classes of cases' the court was competent to adjudicate but to proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that court's adjudicatory authority). In other words, § 363(m) reads like a statutory limitation, Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 516, 126 S.Ct. 1235, that is tied in some instances to the need for a party to take certain procedural steps at certain specified times (here, seeking a stay), Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197. And we certainly cannot say that § 363(m)'s jurisdictional nature is clear ex visceribus verborum, as we once did of a statutory provision directing that `no court shall have jurisdiction over a covered action,' Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 467-468, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007).",Jackson,0,
2022-025,61,"Statutory context further clinches the case. Congress separated § 363(m) from the Code provisions that recognize federal courts' jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(a)-(b), (e), 157, 158, see also Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 515, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (emphasizing separation as evidence of nonjurisdictional status).5 And § 363(m) does not contain any  clear tie to the Code's plainly jurisdictional provisions. Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1499. Nor does the Code lack for examples of such ties: Consider 11 U.S.C. § 305(c), which directs that certain judicial orders are not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under § 158(d) (the Code provision that recognizes the courts of appeals' jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters).6",Jackson,0,
2022-025,62,"It also does not suffice that § 363(m) issues directions, as Transform occasionally intimates. We routinely hold that congressional commands are nonjurisdictional despite emphatic directives.7 Transform seems to ignore the possibility that § 363(m)'s particular statutory limitations, Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 516, 126 S.Ct. 1235, could be important directives and yet not jurisdictional, Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197. But it is hardly clear to us that § 363(m)'s commands do anything more than that.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,64,"Transform offers two creative retorts, neither of which excavates a clear statement from § 363(m)'s unassuming text.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,66,"Transform insists that § 363(b) sales of estate assets must proceed under a court's in rem jurisdiction, and that courts can only exercise in rem jurisdiction with respect to a res (including interests like the leasehold here) over which they have actual or constructive control. Brief for Respondent 2, 39-40, 42. Appealing to traditional principles of in rem jurisdiction, Transform reasons that the transfer of a res to a good-faith purchaser removes it from the bankruptcy estate, and so from the court's in rem jurisdiction over the estate. Id., at 24, 39-40. And it thus concludes that § 363(m) is jurisdictional, because it operates to ensure that (absent a stay) courts cannot disturb a transfer to a good-faith purchaser, thereby confirming the traditional in rem truth that the bankruptcy court cannot reach the res, and thus has no basis for the exercise of in rem jurisdiction over it. Id., at 39-40.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,67,"This argument teeters on a contorted framing of contested general background principles rather than § 363(m)'s text and context (which, as we have said, lack any clear jurisdictional hue). Moreover, even setting aside MOAC's credible retort that traditional in rem jurisdiction did not necessarily cease when the res left a court's custody, Reply Brief 6-9, Transform's contentions about § 363(m)'s relationship to traditional in rem jurisdiction merely offer a reason to think Congress  intended § 363(m) to be jurisdictional. That, without more, is not enough. See Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1499. Transform does not (because it cannot) deny the paucity of textual or contextual clues indicating a clear statement of jurisdictional intent. See Part III-B, supra. And whatever else one might say about Transform's clear-statement case, it certainly has not shown that § 363(m)'s supposed alignment with allegedly pre-existing jurisdictional truths is so powerful that it nullifies these otherwise compelling nonjurisdictional inferences.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,68,"Section § 363(m)'s operation further derails this bankshot argument. Transform's assertion is that § 363(m) is jurisdictional because it confirms a traditional truth that bankruptcy courts exercising in rem jurisdiction cannot touch a res that is transferred out of the estate. Brief for Respondent 39. But that sits uncomfortably with § 363(m)'s express contemplation that courts can touch—and affect the validity of—certain sales or leases (e.g., those made to bad-faith purchasers) due to reversals or modifications of covered authorizations even though the property concerned has left the estate. Consequently, even if § 363(m) mirrors traditional in rem jurisdiction, it does not seem to reflect what Transform wishes to see.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,69,"What is more, to the extent that a lower court can act with respect to the res at all, surely it can only do so while exercising congressionally conferred jurisdiction. Celotex Corp. v. Edwards, 514 U.S. 300, 307, 115 S.Ct. 1493, 131 L.Ed.2d 403 (1995). Applied here, that principle puts Transform on the horns of a dilemma. If a court, consistent with § 363(m), issues a judgment affecting a consummated sale's validity that draws on any in rem jurisdiction the Code confers in § 1334, that conferral authorizes the exercise of in rem power with respect to a res that has left the estate. Section 363(m) could hardly confirm a supposed traditional truth that its concept of jurisdiction rejects. But if that hypothetical judgment draws on a non-in rem source of jurisdiction, then § 363(m)'s power source is even further disconnected from Transform's contested claims about traditional in rem jurisdiction.8 Either way, § 363(m) tells a jurisdictional tale inconsistent with the one Transform needs.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,70,"In the end, then, Transform's claims about traditional in rem jurisdiction are red herrings. Section 363(m) is what matters, and Congress has not clearly stated that the provision is a limit on judicial power, rather than a mere restriction on the effects of a valid exercise of that power when a party successfully appeals a covered authorization.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,72,"Transform's second major salvo fares no better. It points to former Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 805, which was promulgated in 1976,9 and characterizes that Rule as `declaratory of' a historic practice in which some appellate courts dismissed  appeals challenging the validity of a consummated sale  without considering the merits, which Transform equates with jurisdictional treatment. Brief for Respondent 43-44. Transform vigorously maintains that Congress fully transplanted Rule 805 into § 363(m), and that § 363(m) therefore imbibed the jurisdictional character that Rule 805 incorporated from the historic practice.",Jackson,0,
2022-025,73,"This argument relies on a supposed pre-1976 lower court jurisdictional consensus that Rule 805 formalized and Congress then built into § 363(m). But Transform trips over the first hurdle: Rule 805's supposedly jurisdictional character. We rejected this sort of use of old lower court cases in Boechler, because almost all of those lower court cases predated this Court's effort to `bring some discipline' to the use of the term `jurisdictional.' 596 U. S., at ___-___, 142 S.Ct., at 1499-1500. The facts here are even worse for Transform: Every case it cites to prove that Rule 805 was jurisdictional predates § 363(m)'s initial 1978 enactment, and thus long predates our modern efforts on jurisdictional nomenclature. If numerous recent lower court opinions (some as recent as 2005) treating the provision at issue as jurisdictional were not enough in Reed Elsevier, 559 U.S. at 160, n. 2, 169, 130 S.Ct. 1237, Transform's weaker proffer will not do.* * *",Jackson,0,

Were we to reverse the judgment in Harper I— a step not taken by the North Carolina Supreme Court—the 2021 plans enacted by the legislative defendants would again take effect. The parties accordingly continue to have a personal stake in the ultimate disposition of the lawsuit. Chafin v.

See 380 N.C. at 390-391, 868 S.E.2d at 551-552. That issue both has survived and requires decision because subsequent proceedings have neither altered Harper I's analysis of the federal issue nor negated the effect of its judgment striking down the 2021 plans.

Well after the time for seeking rehearing as to that judgment passed, the legislative defendants instead sought rehearing with respect to Harper II, a distinct decision concerning remedies.

When a state legislature carries out its constitutional power to prescribe rules regulating federal elections, the commission under which it exercises authority is two-fold.

But they read those cases to differentiate between procedural and substantive constraints. Brief for Petitioners 24, post, at 2102-2103 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Smiley, in their view, stands for the proposition that state constitutions may impose only procedural hoops through which legislatures must jump in crafting rules governing federal elections. This concededly formalistic approach views the Governor's veto at issue in Smiley as one such procedural restraint. Tr. of Oral Arg. 62. But when it comes to substantive provisions, their argument goes, our precedents have nothing to say.",Roberts,0,
2022-026,97,"This argument adopts too cramped a view of our decision in Smiley. Chief Justice Hughes's opinion for the Court drew no distinction between procedural and  substantive restraints on lawmaking. It turned on the view that state constitutional provisions apply to a legislature's exercise of lawmaking authority under the Elections Clause, with no concern about how those provisions might be categorized. 285 U.S. at 367-368, 52 S.Ct. 397, see also Hildebrant, 241 U.S. at 569-570, 36 S.Ct. 708.",Roberts,0,

2022-026,99,"The dissent reads Smiley and Arizona State Legislature in a different light. Justice THOMAS thinks those cases say nothing about whether a State can impose substantive limits on the legislature's exercise of power under the Elections Clause. Post, at 2102-2103. But in Smiley, we addressed whether the conditions which attach to the making of state laws apply to legislatures exercising authority under the Elections Clause. 285 U.S. at 365, 52 S.Ct. 397. We held that they do. Much that is urged in argument with regard to the meaning of the term `Legislature,' we explained, is beside the point. Ibid. And we concluded in straightforward terms that legislatures must abide by restrictions imposed by state constitutions when exercising the lawmaking power under the Elections Clause. Id., at 369, 52 S.Ct. 397. Arizona State Legislature said much the same, emphasizing that, by its text, nothing in the Elections Clause offers state legislatures carte blanche to act in defiance of provisions of the State's constitution. 576 U.S. at 818, 135 S.Ct. 2652.",Roberts,0,
2022-026,100,"The defendants and Justice THOMAS do not in any event offer a defensible line between procedure and substance in this context. The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy.

Procedure, after all, is often used as a vehicle to achieve substantive ends. When a governor vetoes a bill because of a disagreement with its policy consequences, has the governor exercised a procedural or substantive restraint on lawmaking? Smiley did not endorse such murky inquiries into the nature of constitutional restraints, and we see no neat distinction today.",Roberts,0,
2022-026,102,"Were there any doubt, historical practice confirms that state legislatures remain bound by state constitutional restraints when exercising authority under the Elections Clause.

2022-026,103,"Two state constitutional provisions adopted shortly after the founding offer the strongest evidence. Delaware's 1792 Constitution provided that the State's congressional representatives shall be voted for at the same places where representatives in the State legislature are voted for, and in the same manner. Art. VIII, § 2. Even though the Elections Clause stated that the Places and Manner of federal elections shall be prescribed by the state legislatures, the Delaware Constitution expressly enacted rules governing the places and manner of holding elections for federal office. An 1810 amendment to the Maryland Constitution likewise embodied regulations falling within the scope of the Elections and Electors Clauses. Article XIV provided that every qualified citizen shall vote, by ballot,  for electors of the President and Vice-President of the United States, and for Representatives of this State in the Congress of the United States. If the Elections Clause had vested exclusive authority in state legislatures, unchecked by state courts enforcing provisions of state constitutions, these clauses would have been unenforceable from the start.",Roberts,0,
2022-026,104,"Besides the two specific provisions in Maryland and Delaware, multiple state constitutions at the time of the founding regulated federal elections by requiring that all elections shall be by ballot. Ga. Const., Art. IV, § 2 (1789), see also, e.g., Pa. Const., Art. III, § 2 (1790), Ky. Const., Art. III, cl. 2 (1792), Tenn. Const., Art. III, § 3 (1796), Ohio Const., Art. IV, § 2 (1803), La. Const., Art. VI, § 13 (1812). These provisions directed the manner of federal elections within the meaning of the Elections Clause, as Madison himself explained at the Constitutional Convention.

At the same time, the Elections Clause expressly vests power to carry out its provisions in the Legislature of each State, a deliberate choice that this Court must respect.

But because the Elections Clause assigns authority respecting federal elections to state legislatures, the Court also correctly concludes that state courts do not have free rein in conducting that review. Ante, at 2087-2088. Therefore, a state court's interpretation of state law in a case implicating the Elections Clause is subject to federal court review. Ante, at 2087-2090, see also Bush v.

But then, after granting petitioners' request for rehearing, the court revisited the crucial issue in this case: whether claims of partisan gerrymandering are justiciable under the state constitution. Harper v. Hall, ___ N.C. ___, ___, 886 S.E.2d 393, 399 (2023) (Harper III). After reexamining the fundamental premises underlying the decisions in both Harper II and Harper I, the court held that partisan gerrymandering claims present a political question that is nonjusticiable under the North Carolina Constitution. Id., at ___ - ___, 886 S.E.2d at 400-401. It concluded:",Thomas,0,
2022-026,144,"This Court's opinion in Harper I is overruled. We affirm the three-judge panel's original 11 January 2022 Judgment concluding, inter alia, that claims of partisan gerrymandering present nonjusticiable, political questions and dismissing all of plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. This Court's opinion in Harper II is withdrawn and superseded by this opinion. The three-judge panel's 23 February 2022 order addressing the Remedial Plans is vacated. Plaintiffs' claims are dismissed with prejudice. Id., at ___, 886 S.E.2d at 449.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,145,"In short, this case is over, and petitioners won. The trial court's original final judgment in favor of petitioners, affirmed by the State Supreme Court in Harper III, represents the final determination of  the rights of the parties in this case. N. C. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(a) (2023). Harper I has been overruled, and plaintiffs-respondents' claims for relief have been dismissed on adequate and independent state-law grounds. As a result, petitioners' alternative Elections Clause defense to those claims no longer requires decision, the merits of that defense simply have no bearing on the judgment between the parties in this action. That is the definition of mootness for an issue.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,146,"It follows that no live controversy remains before this Court. For any case or controversy to exist here, petitioners must be injured by the judgment below, and we must be able to redress that injury by acting upon that judgment. See, e.g., Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2356, 2362, 204 L.Ed.2d 742 (2019), see also Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 86, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807) (The criterion of appellate jurisdiction, is that it revises and corrects the decisions of another tribunal). But petitioners are not injured by the judgment of Harper I at all, nor could we redress any injury to petitioners by doing anything to it. Whether we accept or reject petitioners' Elections Clause defense, plaintiffs-respondents' claims remain dismissed. As far as this case is concerned, there simply is nothing this Court could decide that could make any difference to who wins or what happens next in any lower court. That is the definition of mootness for an appellate proceeding.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,147,"The United States understands this. See Supplemental Letter Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3 (May 11, 2023) (The question this Court granted certiorari to decide is now moot because the Court's resolution of that question could not affect the disposition of this case). So do the elections officials whose conduct Harper I once enjoined. Supplemental Brief for State Respondents 1 (May 11, 2023) (This case is moot). So, too, do the plaintiffs-respondents who started this case in the first place. See Letter Brief for North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, Inc., et al. 2 (May 11, 2023) (The North Carolina Supreme Court's February 2022 judgment reversing the same January 11, 2022 trial-court judgment that the North Carolina Supreme Court just affirmed is now a nullity), Supplemental Letter Brief for Rebecca Harper et al. 1 (May 11, 2023) (Petitioners have won a full victory in state court). As one group of plaintiffs-respondents put it, there is no non-frivolous basis for jurisdiction here. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,149,"The majority does not contest that the Elections Clause issue in this case was only a defense to plaintiffs-respondents' claims for relief. Nor does it deny that Harper III overruled Harper I and affirmed the very same trial-court judgment that Harper I had reversed. And it concedes that, as a result, plaintiffs-respondents' claims have been dismissed in full on state-law nonjusticiability grounds. Thus, the majority does not contend that its opinion on the Elections Clause issue could make any difference to the final judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties in this case. N. C. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b). That should be the end of the discussion. Because the question presented cannot affect the rights of the litigants in the case before us, we are without power to decide it. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971) (per curiam).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,150,"Nonetheless, the majority finds that the judgment below still presents a live Article III case or controversy, it then further concludes that the question presented has  survived and requires decision under Cox Broadcasting.2 See ante, at 2076-2079. In doing so, it relies extensively on petitioners' representations that they remain bound by the judgment in Harper I. Ante, at 2079, see also ante, at 2076, 2077, 2079. But, of course, parties' mere representations that they are injured never carry their burden of demonstrating that they have standing in this Court. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2207, 210 L.Ed.2d 568 (2021) (emphasis added). Nor can such representations affect our independent obligation to assure ourselves that jurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits. Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co., 554 U.S. 316, 324, 128 S.Ct. 2709, 171 L.Ed.2d 457 (2008).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,151,"To ensure that it has jurisdiction here, the majority must explain how petitioners' federal defense could still affect the rights of the litigants in this case. Rice, 404 U.S. at 246, 92 S.Ct. 402. It fails to do so. Instead, it mostly points to irrelevant facts about the procedural history of this case and misapplies civil-procedure rules as if Harper I and Harper III did not involve the same case. But the error that actually drives the majority's conclusion is much deeper. The majority evidently thinks that when Harper I held the 2021 Act unconstitutional, it entered a judgment affecting the 2021 Act as a statute, independent of its application to the legal rights of the litigants in this case. And the majority thinks that to reverse Harper I's judgment would negate the force of its order striking down the Act, thus altering the presently operative statutes of North Carolina. Ante, at 2077 (internal quotation marks omitted). But, of course, the judicial power does not operate on legal rules in the abstract, it operates on the rights and liabilities of contending parties with adverse legal interests. California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2115, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). The majority's reasoning cannot be squared with the judicial power vested by the Constitution, the case-or-controversy requirement, or the nature of judicial review.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,152,"I start by clearing away some of the brush. True, Harper III did not expressly revisit the Elections Clause issue, ante, at 2076-2077, true as well, petitioners did not obtain rehearing of Harper I, see ante, at 2077. But none of that matters because Harper III's final judgment mooted the Elections Clause issue in this case by dismissing plaintiffs-respondents' claims on alternative state-law grounds.3 Likewise,  the idea that Harper III did not alter or amend in any way the judgment in Harper I, ante, at 2078, is both irrelevant and incorrect. It is irrelevant because our jurisdiction requires a case, and this case is over no matter what becomes of the empty husk of Harper I's interlocutory judgment. It is incorrect because Harper I's judgment—reversing the trial court's original judgment and remanding the case— was completely negated by Harper III's affirmance of the same trial-court judgment.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,153,"In the same vein, the majority's suggestion that Harper I has any res judicata consequences is completely inapposite. Ante, at 2078 (internal quotation marks omitted). Res judicata is the principle that a final judgment on the merits of an action bars relitigation in a second action of the same claim or of issues actually litigated and necessary to the judgment in the first action. Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981), see also Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008). Harper I was not a final judgment (as the majority concedes by applying Cox Broadcasting), so res judicata simply has nothing to do with it. Nothing decided by Harper I was res judicata in the second state-court appeal, see Southern R. Co. v. Clift, 260 U.S. 316, 319, 43 S.Ct. 126, 67 L.Ed. 283 (1922), nor would Harper I's interlocutory Elections Clause holding have any res judicata effect in a future action between these parties, see Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27, and Comment h, and Illus. 13 and 14 (1980) (only issue determinations essential to a final judgment have preclusive effect, if a defendant obtains a final judgment based on one defense, the court's rejection of alternative defenses is not preclusive in a later action). At the risk of belaboring the obvious, the clearest proof that Harper I was not a final judgment is Harper III—which revisited Harper I's determination of a crucial issue in this case, ___ N.C., at ___, 886 S.E.2d at 399, overruled Harper I's determination of that issue, and affirmed the very same final judgment for petitioners that Harper I had reversed.4",Thomas,0,
2022-026,154,"How could petitioners still be injured, and what more could this Court possibly do for them? The majority suggests that the interlocutory injunction issued in Harper I still harms petitioners, see ante, at 2077, 2078-2079, but that idea is untenable. To start, the majority overlooks that the injunction only ran against the conduct of defendants-respondents—the state officials who actually implement election laws—not petitioners as legislators. See Berger, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2197. Next, the majority fails to consider  what it would mean if the injunction is still binding: that defendants-respondents are liable to be held in contempt and put in jail if they ever implement the 2021 Act, Richmond Cty. Bd. of Ed. v. Cowell, 254 N.C.App. 422, 426, 803 S.E.2d 27, 30-31 (2017), even though Harper III dismissed this suit's challenge to the Act as beyond the reach of North Carolina's courts, ___ N.C., at ___, 886 S.E.2d at 431 (internal quotation marks omitted). That idea defies both common sense and civil procedure. A court simply does not go on enforcing an interlocutory injunction—and imposing contempt sanctions for disobedience —after reaching a final judgment dismissing every relevant claim for relief. Rather, the interlocutory injunction (like all interlocutory orders) merges into the final judgment fully adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties to the case. N. C. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b) (emphasis added). With the entry of Harper III's final judgment, the life of Harper I's injunction came to an end, and it no longer has a binding effect on any one. Madison Square Garden Boxing, Inc. v. Shavers, 562 F.2d 141, 144 (CA2 1977).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,155,"In any event, the majority's analysis plainly does not turn on the belief that any defendant remains liable to potential contempt sanctions and jail time. Instead, its animating idea (uncritically borrowed from petitioners) is that Harper I's judgment operated against the 2021 Act as a statute. The majority describes Harper I's judgment interchangeably as enjoining the use of the 2021 map and striking down the 2021 plan. Ante, at 2077, 2078. It then reasons that reversing that judgment would negate the force of its order striking down the 2021 plan, thus altering the presently operative statutes of North Carolina such that the 2021 Act would again take effect. Ante, at 2077-2078 (internal quotation marks omitted). The majority regards this aspect of Harper I's judgment as entirely independent of Harper III's final resolution of the claims in this case. See ante, at 2076-2078, 2078-2079. And it finds its theory confirmed by a proviso in a remedial redistricting Act, passed immediately after Harper I, stating that the 2021 Act would again become effective if this Court reversed Harper I. Ante, at 2077-2078 (internal quotation marks omitted). In short, the case or controversy that the majority thinks is still before us has nothing to do with the parties' rights and liabilities on the claims asserted in this action, rather, it is simply whether a particular legislative Act, which Harper I supposedly made inoperative, will again be operative or effective as a state statute. Ante, at 2077-2078 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,156,"This reasoning bears no connection to the judicial power of this Court or the court below. Judicial power is the power to adjudicate definite and concrete disputes touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests, Rice, 404 U.S. at 246, 92 S.Ct. 402 (internal quotation marks omitted), by determining the respective rights and liabilities or duties of the parties before a court in a particular case, Nicholson v. State Ed. Assistance Auth., 275 N.C. 439, 447, 168 S.E.2d 401, 406 (1969). Thus, a judgment binds the rights of the parties in that case, see Taylor, 553 U.S. at 892-893, 128 S.Ct. 2161, and it awards remedies that operate with respect to those specific parties, California, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2115 (internal quotation marks omitted). In deciding any case, the court must ascertain and declare the law applicable to the controversy, this duty, in turn, implies the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment in deciding the case. Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078  (1923), accord, Nicholson, 275 N.C. at 447, 168 S.E.2d at 406, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-178, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). But this negative power of judicial review is not a power per se to review and annul acts of legislation on the ground that they are unconstitutional, Mellon, 262 U.S. at 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, to change or to repeal statutes, Person v. Doughton, 186 N.C. 723, 725, 120 S.E. 481, 483 (1923), or to issue orders that operate on legal rules in the abstract, California, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2116-2117 (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts of law simply do not render judgments that toggle statutes from operative to inoperative and back again, as if judicial review were some sort of in rem jurisdiction over legislative Acts.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,157,"Indeed, such a conception would contradict the most basic premise of judicial review itself. An unconstitutional provision is never really part of the body of governing law, for the Constitution automatically displaces it from the moment of its enactment. Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1761, 1788-1789, 210 L.Ed.2d 432 (2021) (emphasis added). Thus, when a court holds a statute unconstitutional, it is emphatically not depriving it of any legal force that it previously possessed as an Act. The court is only deciding a particular case conformably to the constitution, disregarding a statute that cannot govern the case because it is already void. Marbury, 1 Cranch at 178, accord, Bayard v. Singleton, 1 N.C. 5, 7 (1787) (holding that the unconstitutional act on which a party's motion was grounded  must of course, in that instance, stand as abrogated and without any effect). That is the classic explanation for the basis of judicial review set forth in Marbury and Bayard, and it remains from that day to this the sole continuing rationale for the exercise of this judicial power. Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 678, 91 S.Ct. 1171, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,158,"The majority's theory thus fails twice over, both as a description of Harper I's judgment and as an explanation of how any justiciable controversy could exist in this Court. The only power that the North Carolina courts exercised at any stage of this case was that of determining the respective rights and liabilities or duties of litigants in the controversy before them. Nicholson, 275 N.C. at 447, 168 S.E.2d at 406. Harper I's judgment line did not read: Stricken down, referring to the 2021 Act, but instead: Reversed and remanded, referring to the lower court judgment and the case between these parties. 380 N.C. at 404, 868 S.E.2d at 560 (some capitalization deleted). The judicial power operates upon parties and cases, not statutes, and Harper I was no exception.5  Even if it were, we would still have no case or controversy in front of us. A freestanding judgment of statutory invalidation —neutralizing the 2021 Act in some manner transcending the final determination of the parties' respective rights in this case—would not be a judicial action within the meaning of Article III, and it could not be reviewed in this Court. See Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U.S. 210, 226-227, 29 S.Ct. 67, 53 L.Ed. 150 (1908). We sit as a court of law, not a council of revision, and our powers of judicial review are judicial, not legislative, in nature. Mackey, 401 U.S. at 697, 91 S.Ct. 1160 (opinion of Harlan, J.). The only power that we ever could have exercised here was to modify the adjudicated rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the claims in this action. Because we plainly cannot do so, no matter what we think about the Elections Clause, this proceeding is moot. And the idea that we could still decide petitioners' moot federal defense because it could alter the presently operative statutes of North Carolina— even if it cannot affect the ultimate judgment in this action—is wholly foreign to Article III. Ante, at 2077 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,159,"In that light, the post-Harper I remedial Act and its trigger provision plainly can make no difference to our jurisdiction or lack thereof. Ante, at 2077-2078. When passed, that Act was essentially a change in the State's conduct under judicial constraint (the result of Harper I), but with the declared intention of resuming the original conduct if that constraint were removed. That declaration kept the controversy alive while the constraint still existed, as in Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 545, n. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1545, 143 L.Ed.2d 731 (1999). But, after Harper III, there is no more constraint in this case. Harper I has been overruled, and plaintiffs-respondents' claims have been dismissed in a final judgment. Nothing about this case prevents the State from either enacting or implementing any districting plan. If the presently operative statutes of North Carolina need to be altered, that is the General Assembly's job, not ours. Ante, at 2077 (internal quotation marks omitted). Regardless, petitioners have fully prevailed in this case, and plaintiffs-respondents have not obtained any enforceable relief that could affect the conduct of future elections.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,160,"Indeed, to the extent the trigger provision adds anything to the majority's analysis, it only underscores the absence of a justiciable case or controversy.6 A state  legislature is free to condition the effectiveness of a change in state law on external events, including this Court's actions in cases properly before it. But, as should be obvious, such a trigger provision cannot be the entire basis of an Article III case or controversy. Where, as here, the Court cannot affect the adjudicated rights and liabilities of the parties in the case below, a state legislature cannot manufacture a justiciable controversy by providing that state law will change in some way depending on how this Court answers a moot question. That would simply be a roundabout way of asking this Court to render an advisory opinion. But federal courts cannot give answers simply because someone asks. Uzuegbunam, 592 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 808 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). That is true when the request comes from Congress, see Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 360-361, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246 (1911), and it is equally true when the request comes from a state legislature.7",Thomas,0,
2022-026,161,"In sum, there is no issue before this Court that can affect the judgment in this action. As such, the question presented is moot, and the writ of certiorari should be dismissed.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,163,"I would gladly stop there. The majority's views on the merits of petitioners' moot Elections Clause defense are of far less consequence than its mistaken belief that Article III authorizes any merits conclusion in this case, and I do not wish to belabor a question that we have no jurisdiction to decide. Nonetheless, I do not find the majority's merits reasoning persuasive.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,164,"The Elections Clause of the Constitution provides that the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof, but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. Art. I, § 4, cl. 1. The question presented was whether the people of a State can place state-constitutional limits on the times, places, and manners of holding congressional elections that the Legislature of the State has the power to prescribe. Petitioners said no. Their position rests on three premises, from which the conclusion follows.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,165,"The first premise is that the people of a single State lack any ability to limit powers given by the people of the United States as a whole. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429, 17 U.S. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). This idea should be uncontroversial, as it is the unavoidable consequence of the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and laws. Id., at 436. As the Court once put it (in a case about the Article V ratifying power of state legislatures),  a federal function derived from the Federal Constitution  transcends any limitations sought to be imposed by the people of a State. Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 137, 42 S.Ct. 217, 66 L.Ed. 505 (1922).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,166,"The second premise is that regulating the times, places, and manner of congressional elections `is no original prerogative of state power,' so that such power `had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.' Cook v. Gralike, 531 U.S. 510, 522, 121 S.Ct. 1029, 149 L.Ed.2d 44 (2001) (first quoting 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 627 (3d ed. 1858) (Story), then quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 804, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 131 L.Ed.2d 881 (1995)). This premise is firmly supported by this Court's precedents, which have also held that the Elections Clause is the exclusive delegation of such power, as no other constitutional provision gives the States authority over congressional elections. Cook, 531 U.S. at 522-523, 121 S.Ct. 1029, see also United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 315, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941) (While, in a loose sense, the right to vote for representatives in Congress is sometimes spoken of as a right derived from the states, this statement is true only in the sense that the states are authorized by the Constitution, to legislate on the subject as provided by the Elections Clause (citations omitted)).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,167,"The third premise is that the Legislature thereof does not mean the people of the State or the State as an undifferentiated body politic, but, rather, the lawmaking power as it exists under the State Constitution. This premise comports with the usual constitutional meanings of the words State and Legislature, as well as this Court's precedents. A state, and the legislature of a state, are quite different political beings. Story § 628. A state, in the ordinary sense of the Constitution, is a political community of free citizens  organized under a government sanctioned and limited by a written constitution. Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 721, 19 L.Ed. 227 (1869). `Legislature,' on the other hand, generally means `the representative body which makes the laws of the people.' Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 365, 52 S.Ct. 397, 76 L.Ed. 795 (1932) (quoting Hawke v. Smith, 253 U.S. 221, 227, 40 S.Ct. 495, 64 L.Ed. 871 (1920)).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,168,"To be sure, the precise constitutional significance of the word Legislature depends on the function to be performed under the provision in question. Smiley, 285 U.S. at 365, 52 S.Ct. 397. Because the function contemplated by the Elections Clause is that of making laws, id., at 366, 52 S.Ct. 397, this Court's Elections Clause cases have consistently looked to a State's written constitution to determine the constitutional actors in whom lawmaking power is vested. See Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.S. 787, 795-796, 814, 135 S.Ct. 2652, 192 L.Ed.2d 704 (2015), Smiley, 285 U.S. at 363, 52 S.Ct. 397, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565, 566-568, 36 S.Ct. 708, 60 L.Ed. 1172 (1916).8  The definitions that most precisely explain this Court's holdings were given in a state-court case that anticipated Hildebrant and Smiley by several years: The word `Legislature,' as used in the Elections Clause means the lawmaking body or power of the state, as established by the state Constitution, or, put differently, that body of persons within a state clothed with authority to make the laws. State ex rel. Schrader v. Polley, 26 S.D. 5, 10-11, 127 N.W. 848, 850-851 (1910).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,169,"If these premises hold, then petitioners' conclusion follows: In prescribing the times, places, and manner of congressional elections, the lawmaking body or power of the state, as established by the state Constitution, id., at 10, 127 N.W. at 850, performs a federal function derived from the Federal Constitution, which thus transcends any limitations sought to be imposed by the people of a State, Leser, 258 U.S. at 137, 42 S.Ct. 217. As shown, each premise is easily supported and consistent with this Court's precedents. Petitioners' conclusion also mirrors the Court's interpretation of parallel language in the Electors Clause9 in McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 13 S.Ct. 3, 36 L.Ed. 869 (1892): The words, `in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct,' operate as a limitation upon the State in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power. Id., at 25, 13 S.Ct. 3.10",Thomas,0,
2022-026,170,"The majority rejects petitioners' conclusion, but seemingly without rejecting any of the premises from which that conclusion follows. Its apparent rationale—that Hildebrant, Smiley, and Arizona State Legislature have already foreclosed petitioners' argument—is untenable, as it requires disregarding a principled distinction between the issues in those cases and the question presented here. In those cases, the relevant state-constitutional provisions addressed the allocation of lawmaking power within each State, they defined what acts, performed by which constitutional actors, constituted an exercise of the lawmaking power. Smiley, 285 U.S. at 364, 52 S.Ct. 397, cf. U. S. Const., Art. I, § 7, cl. 2 (describing the processes upon completion of which a bill becomes a Law). In other words, those cases addressed how to identify the Legislature of each State. But, nothing in their holdings speaks at all to whether the people of a State can impose substantive limits on the times, places, and manners that a procedurally complete exercise of the lawmaking power may validly prescribe. These are simply  different questions: There is a difference between how and what. J. Kirby, Limitations on the Power of State Legislatures Over Presidential Elections, 27 Law & Contemp. Prob. 495, 503 (1962).",Thomas,0,
2022-026,171,"This is not an arbitrary distinction, but one rooted in the logic of petitioners' argument. No one here contends that the Elections Clause creates state legislatures or defines the legislative process in any State. Smiley, 285 U.S. at 369, 52 S.Ct. 397. Thus, while the Elections Clause confers a lawmaking power, the exercise of that authority must follow the method which the State has prescribed for legislative enactments. Id., at 367, 52 S.Ct. 397. But, if the power in question is not original to the people of each State and is conferred upon the constituted legislature of the State, then it follows that the people of the State may not dictate what laws can be enacted under that power—precisely as they may not dictate what constitutional amendments their legislatures can ratify under Article V. See Leser, 258 U.S. at 137, 42 S.Ct. 217.11 Accordingly, if petitioners' premises hold, then state constitutions may specify who constitute the Legislature and prescribe how legislative power is exercised, but they cannot control what substantive laws can be made for federal elections.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,172,"The majority indicates that it does not perceive this distinction between substantive and procedural rules, see ante, at 2085-2087,12 illustrating its doubts with a rhetorical question: When a governor vetoes a bill because of a disagreement with its policy consequences, has the governor exercised a procedural or substantive restraint on lawmaking? Ante, at 2086. The answer is straightforward: The power of approving or vetoing bills is a part of the legislative process because it is a part in the making of state laws. Smiley, 285 U.S. at 368-369, 52 S.Ct. 397, see also INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 933, 951, 954, 957, n. 22, 958, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983) (repeatedly referring to bicameralism and presentment as the procedure or procedures of lawmaking). A Governor's  motives for vetoing a certain bill are irrelevant to the effect of the veto as part of the legislative process, just as the motives that may lead one house of the legislature to reject a bill passed by the other house are irrelevant to the effect of its doing so. Put simply, when this power is conferred on the Governor of a State, it makes him in effect a third branch of the legislature. T. Cooley, General Principles of Constitutional Law 50 (1880) (emphasis added), accord, Arizona State Legislature, 576 U.S. at 833, 135 S.Ct. 2652 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (noting that approving and vetoing bills are legislative functions), Chadha, 462 U.S. at 947, 103 S.Ct. 2764 (explaining that lawmaking is a power  shared by both Houses and the President), La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 423, 453, 20 S.Ct. 168, 44 L.Ed. 223 (1899) (noting that Presidential approval is legislative in its nature), cf. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 150 (1765) (The king is himself a part of the parliament). This is a question of who, not what, and thus is a matter of state polity as far as the Elections Clause is concerned. Smiley, 285 U.S. at 368, 52 S.Ct. 397.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,173,"But substantive constraints on what the lawmaking power can do (gubernatorial approval included) demand an entirely different justification—one that the majority never provides. It does not overrule Cook and Thornton to hold that the power to prescribe times, places, and manners for congressional elections is an original power of the people of each State. Nor does it hold that the people are themselves the Legislature to which the Federal Constitution delegates that power. See ante, at 2082-2083. Indeed, the majority devotes little attention to the source and recipient of the power described in the Elections Clause, notwithstanding their direct relevance to the question presented.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,174,"Instead, the majority focuses on the power of state courts to exercise judicial review of Elections Clause legislation. See ante, at 2079-2082, 2087-2090. But that power sheds no light on the question presented. In every case properly before it, any court—state or federal—must ascertain and apply the substantive law that properly governs that case. Thus, the court naturally must apply the Federal Constitution rather than any statute in conflict with it. The court must also apply the state constitution over any conflicting statute enacted under a power limited by that constitution. Petitioners' argument, however, is that legislation about the times, places, and manner of congressional elections is not limited by state constitutions— because the power to regulate those subjects comes from the Federal Constitution, not the people of the State. Right or wrong, this question has nothing to do with whether state courts have the power to conduct judicial review in the first place. To say that state judicial review authorizes applying state constitutions over conflicting Elections Clause legislation, ante, at 2081-2082, is simply to assume away petitioners' argument.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,176,"The majority opinion ends with some general advice to state and lower federal courts on how to exercise judicial review in cases implicating the Elections Clause. Ante, at 2088-2089. As the majority offers no clear rationale for its interpretation of the Clause, it is impossible to be sure what the consequences of that interpretation will be. However, judging from the majority's brief sketch of the regime it envisions, I worry that today's opinion portends serious troubles ahead for the Judiciary.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,177,"The majority uses the separate writings in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000) (per curiam), as a loose touchstone for the kind of judicial  review that it apparently expects federal courts to conduct in future cases like this one. On its face, this is an awkward analogy, for there is a significant difference between Bush and Harper I. In Bush, the state court's judgment was based on an interpretation of state statutory law, enacted by the state legislature. Thus, the relevant Electors Clause question was whether, in doing so, the state court had departed from the clearly expressed intent of the legislature, 531 U.S. at 120, 121 S.Ct. 525 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring), impermissibly distorting the legislature's enactments beyond what a fair reading required, id., at 115, 121 S.Ct. 525. In Harper I, by contrast, there was no doubt that the state court departed from the clearly expressed intent of the legislature, it rejected the legislature's enactment as unconstitutional.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,178,"By doing so, today's majority concludes, Harper I did not commit per se error, as the Elections Clause permits state courts to apply substantive state-constitutional provisions to the times, places, and manner of federal elections. At the same time, state courts are warned that they operate under federal-court supervision, lest they transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review such that they arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections. Ante, at 2089. Thus, under the majority's framework, it seems clear that the statutory-interpretation review forecast in Bush (or some version of it) is to be extended to state constitutional law.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,179,"In this way, the majority opens a new field for Bush-style controversies over state election law—and a far more uncertain one. Though some state constitutions are more prolix than the Federal Constitution, it is still a general feature of constitutional text that only its great out-lines should be marked. McCulloch, 4 Wheat. at 407. When it is a constitution courts are expounding, ibid., not a detailed statutory scheme, the standards to judge the fairness of a given interpretation are typically fewer and less definite.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,180,"Nonetheless, the majority's framework appears to demand that federal courts develop some generalized concept of the bounds of ordinary judicial review, ante, at 2089, apply it to the task of constitutional interpretation within each State, and make that concept their rule of decision in some of the most politically acrimonious and fast-moving cases that come before them. In many cases, it is difficult to imagine what this inquiry could mean in theory, let alone practice. For example, suppose that we were reviewing Harper I under this framework. Perhaps we could have determined that reading justiciable prohibitions against partisan gerrymandering into the North Carolina Constitution exceeded the bounds of ordinary judicial review in North Carolina, perhaps not. If not, then, in order to ensure that Harper I had not arrogated the power of regulating federal elections, ante, at 2089-2090, we would presumably have needed to ask next whether it exceeded the bounds of ordinary judicial review in North Carolina to find that the specific congressional map here violated those prohibitions. After all, in constitutional judgments of this kind, it can be difficult to separate the rule from the fact pattern to which the rule is applied. We have held, however, that federal courts are not equipped to judge partisan-gerrymandering questions at all. Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2484, 2506-2507, 204 L.Ed.2d 931 (2019). It would seem to follow, a fortiori, that they are not equipped to judge whether a state court's partisan-gerrymandering determination surpassed the bounds of ordinary judicial review.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,181,"Even in cases that do not involve a justiciability mismatch, the majority's advice invites questions of the most far-reaching  scope. What are the bounds of ordinary judicial review? What methods of constitutional interpretation do they allow? Do those methods vary from State to State? And what about stare decisis—are federal courts to review state courts' treatment of their own precedents for some sort of abuse of discretion? The majority's framework would seem to require answers to all of these questions and more.",Thomas,0,
2022-026,182,"In the end, I fear that this framework will have the effect of investing potentially large swaths of state constitutional law with the character of a federal question not amenable to meaningful or principled adjudication by federal courts. In most cases, it seems likely that the the bounds of ordinary judicial review will be a forgiving standard in practice, and this federalization of state constitutions will serve mainly to swell federal-court dockets with state-constitutional questions to be quickly resolved with generic statements of deference to the state courts. On the other hand, there are bound to be exceptions. They will arise haphazardly, in the midst of quickly evolving, politically charged controversies, and the winners of federal elections may be decided by a federal court's expedited judgment that a state court exceeded the bounds of ordinary judicial review in construing the state constitution.",Thomas,0,

The governing statute provides that the effective date of the award shall not be earlier than the day on which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) receives the veteran's application for benefits. But the statute specifies 16 exceptions, one of which is relevant here: If the VA receives the application within a year of the veteran's discharge, the effective date is the day after the veteran's discharge. We must decide whether this exception is subject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that would allow some applications filed outside the 1-year period to qualify for the day after discharge effective date.

2022-027,39,"The Secretary of Veterans Affairs advances two reasons why § 5110(b)(1) is not subject to equitable tolling. The first would head tolling off at the pass: He argues that § 5110(b)(1) is not a statute of limitations, so the presumption is wholly inapplicable. See Lozano, 572 U.S. at 13-14, 134 S.Ct. 1224 (We have only applied Irwin's presumption to statutes of limitations). Rather than extinguishing a tardy claim (the function of a statute of limitations), § 5110(b)(1) caps the award for a successful claim (a different function). Brief for Respondent 18-22. That it does so with reference to the time of filing, the Secretary says, does not convert it into a statute of limitations. Id., at 21, 134 S.Ct. 1224. In any event, the Secretary adds, equitable tolling is at odds with the statutory text and structure—so even assuming that § 5110(b)(1) sets a limitations period, the presumption is rebutted.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,40,"We need not address the Secretary's first argument because the second is straightforward. The presumption is rebutted if there is good reason to believe that Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply. United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347, 350, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997). In this case, there is very good reason to draw that conclusion. Section 5110 contains detailed instructions for when a veteran's claim for benefits may enjoy an effective date earlier than the one provided by the default rule. It would be inconsistent with this comprehensive scheme for an adjudicator to extend effective dates still further through the doctrine of equitable tolling.1",Barrett,0,
2022-027,42,"Start with the text. Section 5110(b)(1) operates as a limited exception to § 5110(a)(1)'s default rule, which states that the effective date of an award  shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. The default applies unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter—a clause indicating that Congress enumerated an exhaustive list of exceptions, with each confined to its specific terms. § 5110(a)(1). According to the terms of the exception in § 5110(b)(1), the effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the day following the date of the veteran's discharge or release if application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. Equitably tolling this provision would depart from the terms that Congress specifically provided. § 5110(a)(1).",Barrett,0,
2022-027,43,"The structure of § 5110 reinforces Congress's choice to set effective dates solely as prescribed in the text. The statute sets  out detailed instructions that explain when various types of benefits qualify for an effective date earlier than the default. There are 16 such exceptions—and equitable tolling is not on the list. See §§ 5110(b)(1), (b)(2)(A), (b)(3), (b)(4)(A), (c), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (n). Notably, these exceptions do not operate simply as time constraints, but also as substantive limitations on the amount of recovery due. See, e.g., § 5110(g) (In no event shall an award or increase under this paragraph be retroactive for more than one year from the date of application therefor or the date of administrative determination of entitlement, whichever is earlier). We stated in Brockamp that an explicit listing of exceptions in a statute containing detail and describing not only procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of recovery strongly indicated that Congress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned, open-ended, `equitable' exceptions into the statute that it wrote. 519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. So too here. If Congress wanted the VA to adjust a claimant's entitlement to retroactive benefits based on unmentioned equitable factors, it is difficult to see why it spelled out a long list of situations in which a claimant is entitled to adjustment—and instructed the VA to stick to the exceptions specifically provided. § 5110(a)(1).",Barrett,0,
2022-027,44,"That many of the specific exceptions reflect equitable considerations heightens the structural inference. Several, including § 5110(b)(1), apply when the event triggering the entitlement to benefits is disability or death—both circumstances in which prompt filing could be challenging for a veteran or her survivors. See §§ 5110(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4)(A), (d), cf. Lozano, 572 U.S. at 10, 134 S.Ct. 1224 (noting that equitable tolling may be appropriate when a person diligently pursues her rights but an extraordinary circumstance prevents her from bringing a timely action). One permits an earlier effective date for the award of benefits to a veteran's child, a claimant typically dependent on others for prompt filing. § 5110(e)(1). Still others permit retroactive benefits when facts change or new evidence emerges. See § 5110(h) (permitting retroactive benefits when actual income would increase a pension that had been awarded based on anticipated income), § 5110(i) (permitting retroactive benefits when any disallowed claim is readjudicated and thereafter allowed on the basis of new and relevant evidence resulting from the correction of certain military records). Yet despite its attention to fairness, Congress did not throw the door wide open in these circumstances or any other. In all but one instance, Congress capped retroactive benefits at roughly one year.2  This pattern matters. That Congress accounted for equitable factors in setting effective dates strongly suggests that it did not expect an adjudicator to add a broader range of equitable factors to the mix. And its decision to consistently cap retroactive benefits strongly suggests that it did not expect open-ended tolling to dramatically increase the size of an award. When Congress has already considered equitable concerns and limited the relief available, additional equitable tolling would be unwarranted. Beggerly, 524 U.S. at 48-49, 118 S.Ct. 1862.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,45,"Section 5110(b)(4), another disability-related exception to the default rule, illustrates the point. Recall that § 5110(b)(1), the exception at issue here, adjusts the effective date of disability compensation to the day after a veteran's discharge from the military, so long as the VA receives the claim within one year of discharge. Arellano contends that his claim, filed 30 years after discharge, should relate back to the date of discharge because his disability prevented him from filing earlier than he did. But § 5110(b)(4), which applies to disability pensions rather than disability compensation, expressly accounts for this very concern: It makes pension benefits retroactive to the date of permanent and total disability if the disability prevented the veteran from applying for an award at the time of onset. §§ 5110(b)(4)(A), (B). The possibility that disability could cause delay was therefore on Congress's radar, still, Congress did not explicitly account for it in § 5110(b)(1). Moreover, while Arellano posits an open-ended grace period for § 5110(b)(1), § 5110(b)(4)(A) imposes a restrictive one: It applies only if the veteran applies for a retroactive award within one year of the date on which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled. Why would Congress allow an unlimited grace period for an equitable concern unmentioned in § 5110(b)(1) when it established a limited grace period for the same concern explicitly mentioned in § 5110(b)(4)? Tolling § 5110(b)(1) would single it out for special treatment, enforcing its terms keeps it consistent with the statutory scheme.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,46,"The most compelling argument for equitable tolling is that hard and fast limits on retroactive benefits can create harsh results. The statutory default ties the start of benefits to the application-receipt date, a choice that incentivizes promptness and disfavors retroactive awards. The exceptions granting a 1-year grace period soften that choice in specified circumstances, yet there are situations in which equity's flexible, open-ended approach would be more generous to a deserving claimant. With this in mind, Congress could have designed a scheme that allowed adjudicators to maximize fairness in every case. But Congress has the power to choose between rules, which prioritize efficiency and predictability, and standards, which prioritize optimal results in individual cases. Cf. Brockamp, 519 U.S. at 352-353, 117 S.Ct. 849 (observing that Congress decided to pay the price of occasional unfairness in individual cases  in order to maintain a more workable tax enforcement system). Congress opted for rules in this statutory scheme, and an equitable extension of § 5110(b)(1)'s 1-year grace period would disrupt that choice.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,48,"Arellano contests all of this. Laser focused on § 5110(b)(1), he argues that the provision's unadorned text contains none of the specific, technical language that might otherwise rebut the presumption of equitable tolling. In addition, he emphasizes that there are zero express exceptions to § 5110(b)(1)'s one-year clock, which he describes as fatal to the Secretary's position. Reply Brief 14. As Arellano  sees it, § 5110(b)(1) is a simple time limit and therefore a classic case for equitable tolling.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,49,"If § 5110(b)(1) stood alone, there might be something to Arellano's argument. (Again, assuming that § 5110(b)(1) is a limitations period to which the Irwin presumption applies.) But § 5110(b)(1) cannot be understood independently of § 5110(a)(1), which makes the date of receipt the effective date unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter. Arellano insists that the Secretary overreads unless by treating it as a signal that the enacted exceptions are exclusive. Brief for Petitioner 31-32. But the clause says more than unless—it says that the default applies unless specifically provided otherwise. § 5110(a)(1) (emphasis added). That is an instruction to attend to specifically enacted language to the exclusion of general, unenacted carveouts. While Arellano claims to seek an equitable exception to a general rule, he actually seeks an equitable exception to an exception to a general rule. Structurally, that is a heavy lift. Moreover, § 5110(b)(1) is nestled within a list of 15 other exceptions to § 5110(a)(1)'s default rule, and, as we have already explained, the presence of this detailed, lengthy list raises the inference that the enumerated exceptions are exclusive.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,50,"Arellano also resists the proposition that the express accounting for disability-caused delay in § 5110(b)(4) hurts his case. On the contrary, he insists that it works in his favor. Citing Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 122 S.Ct. 1036, 152 L.Ed.2d 79 (2002), he maintains that an express tolling provision does not displace the presumption of tolling but rather demonstrates that a statute incorporates traditional equitable principles. Brief for Petitioner 37-38. According to Arellano, Congress's silence in § 5110(b)(1) merely shows that it wanted those traditional principles to apply at full strength. Ibid., Reply Brief 19-20.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,51,"We disagree. Section 5110(b)(4) does not help Arellano, for the reasons we have already explained, it illustrates why equitably tolling § 5110(b)(1) is incongruent with the statutory scheme. Young is inapposite. There, we concluded that an express tolling provision for a time limit in a bankruptcy statute supported equitable tolling of a different time limit in the same statute. 535 U.S. at 53, 122 S.Ct. 1036. But that was largely because the express tolling provision authorized tolling where equity would not otherwise have permitted it. Ibid. As a result, we interpreted the express tolling provision to supplement rather than displace principles of equitable tolling. Ibid. (emphasis deleted). Here, however, § 5110(b)(4) does not authorize tolling that equity would not otherwise have allowed. If anything, its conditional and narrow applicability limits tolling that might otherwise have occurred. Though Arellano makes a valiant effort to turn a negative into a positive, § 5110(b)(4) remains an obstacle to his interpretation.",Barrett,0,
2022-027,52,"Finally, Arellano contends that the `nature of the underlying subject matter'— veterans' benefits—counsels in favor of tolling here. Brief for Petitioner 33-34. To support this proposition, he invokes Brockamp, which considered whether courts can equitably toll time limits for filing taxrefund claims. 519 U.S. at 348, 117 S.Ct. 849. After holding that the statute's text and structure rebutted the Irwin presumption, we observed that the nature of the underlying subject matter—tax collection—underscored the linguistic point. Brockamp, 519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. Tax law, after all, is not normally characterized by case-specific exceptions reflecting individualized equities. Ibid. By contrast, Arellano argues, providing benefits to veterans is a context in which individualized  equities are paramount. See King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U.S. 215, 220, n. 9, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (Provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries' favor).",Barrett,0,
2022-027,53,"If the text and structure favored Arellano, the nature of the subject matter would garnish an already solid argument. But the nature of the subject matter cannot overcome text and structure that foreclose equitable tolling. Brockamp turned to the nature of the underlying subject matter only to underscore the linguistic point. 519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. Arellano, however, lacks the linguistic point. This is not a case in which competing interpretations are equally plausible, it is one in which Congress's choice is evident.3* * *",Barrett,0,

On one side were the Ohio National Guard, the Ohio Adjutant General, and the Ohio Adjutant General's Department (collectively petitioners or the Guard). On the other was the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3970, AFL-CIO (Union), which represents federal employees known as dual-status technicians who work in both civilian and military roles for the Guard.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,27,"The Union petitioned the FLRA to resolve the dispute. But, under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS or Statute), the FLRA only has jurisdiction over labor organizations and federal agencies—and petitioners insist that they are neither. 5 U.S.C. § 7101 et seq. We hold, however, that petitioners act as a federal agency when they hire and supervise dual-status technicians serving in their civilian role.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,30,"Enacted in 1978, the FSLMRS establishes a comprehensive framework governing labor-management relations in federal agencies. It secures the right of each employee to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal. § 7102. And, it further guarantees that each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. Ibid. To that end, the FSLMRS provides for collective bargaining between federal agencies and their employees' unions, and it bars each from committing unfair labor practices. See §§ 7102(2) and 7116(a)-(b). For example, an agency may not interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under the Statute, refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization as required by the Statute, or otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of the Statute. §§ 7116(a)(1), (5), (8).",Thomas,0,

It provides that the FLRA's general counsel shall investigate a charge against any agency or labor organization and, if warranted, may issue a complaint calling for a hearing before the FLRA. §§ 7118(a)(1)-(2). The FLRA is then responsible for conducting hearings and resolving such complaints. § 7105(a)(2)(G).

2022-028,36,"The parties' collective-bargaining relationship dates back to 1971, when the Guard recognized the Union as the exclusive representative of its dual-status technicians. They have since negotiated a number of collective-bargaining agreements (CBAs), the most recent of which was signed in 2011 and expired in 2014. As the expiration date neared, the Guard and the Union entered into negotiations for a new agreement. During this process, in March 2016, they adopted a memorandum of understanding whereby the Ohio Adjutant General promised to abide by certain practices contained in the expired agreement. But, later that year, the Ohio Adjutant General's Department reversed course. It asserted that it was not bound by the expired CBA and did not consider itself bound by the FSLMRS when interacting with dual-status technicians. The Guard also sent letters to dual-status technician Union members, asking them to submit the requisite forms to permit the deduction of Union dues from their pay. The letters advised that, if the technicians did not promptly submit the forms, the Guard would cancel dues deductions on their behalf. The Guard ultimately terminated dues withholding for 89 technicians.",Thomas,0,

Department of Defense, Ohio National Guard, alleging that the Guard had refused to negotiate in good faith and interfered with the exercise of employee rights under the Statute through its treatment of technicians' dues deductions. App. 16. The Ohio Adjutant General and the Ohio Adjutant General's Department intervened on the side of the Ohio National Guard.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,38,"Petitioners argued before the Administrative Law Judge that the Guard was not an agency and that dual-status technician bargaining-unit employees were not employees for purposes of the Statute. The Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended decision finding that the FLRA had jurisdiction over the Guard, that the dual-status technicians had collective-bargaining rights under the Statute, and that the Guard's actions in repudiating the CBA violated the Statute. It thus ordered  petitioners to follow the mandatory terms of the 2011 CBA, bargain in good faith going forward, and reinstate Union dues withholding. A divided panel of the FLRA adopted the Administrative Law Judge's findings, conclusions, and remedial order.",Thomas,0,

The Sixth Circuit held that the Guard is an agency subject to the Statute when it operates in its capacity as employer of dual-status technicians. The court further found that dual-status technicians are federal civilian employees with collective-bargaining rights under the Statute. Thus, because the FLRA has authority to enforce those collective-bargaining rights, the court concluded that this dispute fell within its jurisdiction.",Thomas,0,

2022-028,42,"Under the FSLMRS, it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under the Statute. 5 U.S.C. § 7116(a)(1). The FLRA's jurisdiction over this unfair labor practices dispute thus turns on whether petitioners are an agency for purposes of the Statute when they act in their capacities as supervisors of dual-status technicians, a question bounded by a series of defined terms. The Statute defines an agency as an Executive agency, with exceptions not relevant here. § 7103(a)(3). Then, the term `Executive agency,' as used in Title 5, means an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment. § 105. And each of those terms is separately defined: an Executive department means each of 15 Cabinet-level Departments, including the Department of Defense, § 101, a `Government corporation' means a corporation owned or controlled by the Government of the United States, § 103, and an `independent establishment' means an establishment in the executive branch, with exceptions not relevant here, which is not an Executive department, military department, Government corporation, or part thereof, or part of an independent establishment, § 104(1). It is undisputed that the Guard is neither a Government corporation nor an independent establishment, leaving only Executive department at issue.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,43,"Petitioners work backwards through the links in the statutory chain. They argue that they are not an Executive department because they are not listed among the 15 Cabinet-level Departments specified in § 101. Thus, they claim, they are not an Executive agency under § 105 and, accordingly, do not qualify as an agency under the Statute. Respondents counter that the components, representatives, and agents of an agency may be required to comply with the Statute. And they emphasize that petitioners exercise federal authority in employing dual-status technicians and must therefore comply with applicable federal law. Respondents have the better of the argument.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,45,"The Guard, when employing dual-status technicians, functions as an agency covered by the Statute. The Statute defines `agency' to include the Department of Defense, one of the enumerated executive Departments in § 101. § 7103(a)(3), see §§ 101 and 105. And, each dual-status technician  is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, 32 U.S.C. § 709(e), see also 10 U.S.C. § 10216(a)(1)(A). Those Departments, in turn, are components of the Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. §§ 111(b)(6) and (8). And, components of covered agencies plainly fall within the Statute's reach. 5 U.S.C. §§ 7103(a)(12) (contemplating collective bargaining between the representative of an agency and the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit in the agency) and 7112(a) (contemplating the establishment of appropriate bargaining units on an agency, plant, installation, functional, or other basis). Accordingly, when petitioners employ and supervise dual-status technicians, they—like components of an agency—exercise the authority of the Department of Defense, a covered agency.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,46,"The statutory authority permitting the Adjutant General to employ dual-status technicians reinforces this point. Adjutants general appoint dual-status technicians as civilian employees in the federal civil service. See 5 U.S.C. § 2105(a)(1)(F) (providing that the term `employee,' for purposes of Title 5, ordinarily includes an individual  appointed in the federal civil service by  an adjutant general designated by the Secretary of the Army or of the Air Force under section 709(d) of title 32). And, Congress has required the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force to designate adjutants general to employ and administer technicians. 32 U.S.C. § 709(d). That designation is the sole basis for petitioners' authority to employ technicians performing work in their federal civilian roles, confirming that petitioners act on behalf of—and exercise the authority of—a covered federal agency when they supervise dual-status technicians.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,47,"Here, for example, a 1968 order of the Secretary of the Army designates and empowers each adjutant general to employ and administer the Army National Guard technicians authorized for his State as the case may be. General Order 85, ¶3. Accordingly, dual-status technicians are ultimately employees of the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force, and petitioners are the Secretaries' designees for purposes of dual-status technician employment. Should a state adjutant general wish to employ federal dual-status technicians, he must do so pursuant to delegated federal authority and subject to federal civil-service requirements. See 5 U.S.C. § 2105(a)(1)(F). Indeed, it would be passing strange if dual-status technicians, who qualify as employees under the Statute, were supervised by an entity not required to safeguard the rights guaranteed employees under the Statute. §§ 7102 (providing that each employee shall be protected in the exercise of his right to join or refrain from joining a labor association) and 7103(a)(2)(A) (defining an `employee' as an individual  employed in an agency). The case caption in this matter reflects the Guard's federal function with respect to hiring dual-status technicians, before the FLRA, the case proceeded against the U. S. Department of Defense, Ohio National Guard, with the Adjutant General and the Adjutant General's Department joining the suit later as intervenors. App. 16.",Thomas,0,

2022-028,49,"But, the FLRA enforces the rights and obligations of federal civilian employees and their agency employers. Because adjutants general act on behalf of an agency of the Federal Government with respect to their supervision of civilian technicians, their actions in that capacity do not implicate the balance between federal and state powers.

2022-028,51,"The evolution of federal agency-employee relations law and the text of 5 U.S.C. § 7135(b), which functions as the Statute's saving clause, lend further support to the FLRA's exercise of authority over the Guard. Before the FSLMRS was adopted, labor-management relations in the federal sector were governed by a program established by a series of Executive Orders, under which federal employees had limited rights to engage in collective bargaining. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, 464 U.S. 89, 91-92, 104 S.Ct. 439, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983). The Statute's immediate predecessor, Executive Order No. 11491, established the precursor to the current FLRA and listed prohibited unfair labor practices for both federal agency management and unions. See Exec. Order No. 11491, 3 C.F.R. 861 (1966-1970 Comp.). When Congress later replaced that Executive Order with the FSLMRS, it explicitly continued many aspects of the pre-FSLMRS regime: Policies, regulations, and procedures established under and decisions issued under Executive Order 11491  shall remain in full force and effect until revised or revoked by the President, or unless superseded by specific provisions of the Statute or by regulations or decisions issued pursuant to the Statute. 5 U.S.C. § 7135(b). Thus, decisions issued under Executive Order 11491 supply critical guidance regarding the FLRA's jurisdiction today.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,52,"One such decision is directly on point. In the 1971 case of Mississippi National Guard, 172d Military Airlift Group (Thompson Field), Asst. Sec. Labor/Management Reports (A/SLMR) No. 20 (Thompson Field), the Assistant Secretary of Labor—exercising adjudicative authority under Executive Order No. 11491 analogous to the modern FLRA's—rejected arguments virtually identical to those petitioners advance here. See id., at 2 (describing the state guard's argument that the provisions of Executive Order 11491 did not apply  because the employees involved are under the operational control of the Adjutant General of the State of Mississippi, who is appointed and employed pursuant to State law). The Assistant Secretary reasoned that National Guard technicians were employees within the meaning of the Executive Order and employees of the Federal government under the Technicians Act. Id., at 6. The Assistant Secretary then concluded that the adjutant general had been designated as an agent of the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force in employing and administering dual-status technicians and that this agency relationship created the obligation to comply with Executive Order No. 11491. Id., at 7.",Thomas,0,
2022-028,53,"The definitions of employee and agency that Thompson Field examined under Executive Order No. 11491 were materially identical to those that Congress ultimately adopted in the FSLMRS. Compare 5 U.S.C. §§ 7103(a)(2)-(3) (defining `employee' as an individual  employed in an agency, and defining `agency' as an Executive agency, which § 105 in turn defines as an executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment) with Exec. Order No. 11491, §§ 2(a)-(b) (defining `employee' primarily as an employee of an agency, and defining  `agency' as an executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment). We would, therefore, ordinarily presume that the FSLMRS maintained the same coverage that existed under the prior regime. See, e.g., George v. McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1953, 1959, 213 L.Ed.2d 265 (2022), Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___-___, 139 S.Ct. 1795, 1801-1802, 204 L.Ed.2d 129 (2019). We see nothing to weaken the force of that presumption here. On the contrary, § 7135(b) specifically demonstrates Congress' intent to leave the prior regime in place except where it was specifically altered. And, because the President has not revoked it and neither the FSLMRS nor associated regulations have repudiated it, the decision in Thompson Field remains in full force and effect. § 7135(b).* * *",Thomas,0,

Each dual-status technician is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, those Departments are, in turn, components of the Department of Defense, and the Department of Defense is a covered agency under the Statute. Further, a designation from the Department of the Army is the sole basis for petitioners' authority to employ dual-status technicians. Accordingly, petitioners employ federal dual-status technicians pursuant to delegated federal authority and subject to federal civil-service requirements.

That order directs petitioners to honor their existing agreement with the union that represents the dual-status civilian technicians who are members of the Ohio National Guard and to bargain in good faith with the union in the future. The Court correctly observes that the FLRA's ability to enter such an order against petitioners turns on whether petitioners are an `agency' for purposes of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. Ante, at 1197-1198, see 5 U.S.C. § 7105(g)(3). But the Court stops short of answering that question, holding instead that petitioners act as a federal `agency,' ante, at 1196, exercise the authority of a covered agency, ante, at 1199, and even function as an agency, ante, at 1199. Because petitioners are not actually federal agencies, a proposition that the Court does not dispute, the FLRA lacks jurisdiction to enter remedial orders against them.",Alito,0,

Geringer, 295 F.3d 1082, 1084, 1086 (C.A.10 2002) (considering a Rev.

But the consequences of petitioners' theory are not nearly as odd as the majority claims, and a plain reading of the statutory text leads ineluctably to the conclusion that petitioners are not agencies within the meaning of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS or Statute). 5 U.S.C. § 7105(g)(3).",Alito,0,

2022-028,64,"First, the FSLMRS gives the FLRA remedial jurisdiction over an entity if it is an agency or a labor organization. § 7105(g)(3). Second, petitioners are obviously not labor organizations, and thus the only question before us is whether they are agencies. Third, agency, a defined term in the FSLMRS, means, with certain exceptions not relevant here, an Executive agency. § 7103(a)(3). Fourth, an Executive agency is defined as an Executive department, a Government corporation, or an independent establishment. § 105. Fifth, no petitioner is listed among the executive departments in § 101's exhaustive list. See § 101. Likewise, no petitioner is either a Government corporation (i.e., a corporation owned or controlled by the Government of the United States, § 103(1)) or an independent establishment (i.e., an establishment in the executive branch, § 104(1)).

That should be the end of the matter.",Alito,0,
2022-028,67,"Because it is so clear that no petitioner is an agency, the Court sidesteps the issue. Instead, it rests its decision on three main grounds. It notes: (1) the dual status technicians are federal employees, (2) petitioners exercise the authority of a covered agency as components or representatives of that agency, ante, at 1199, and (3) pre-FSLMRS administrative practice supports the FLRA's exercise of jurisdiction. None of these grounds justifies the conclusion that any of the petitioners is an agency subject to the FLRA's remedial authority.",Alito,0,

Ante, at 1196-1197, 1199-1200, 1201. The Court  posits that it would be passing strange if dual-status technicians, who qualify as employees under the Statute, were supervised by an entity not required to safeguard the rights guaranteed employees under the Statute. Ante, at 1199. But the question on which this case turns is not whether the technicians are federal employees or whether they have civil service or bargaining rights. It is not even whether petitioners are obligated to safeguard the technicians' bargaining rights. The question is whether any such obligations can be enforced by means of an order from the FLRA.",Alito,0,
2022-028,70,"In the context of our own remedial authority, we regularly acknowledge many potential impediments to granting a judicial remedy, even to a litigant that might be able to prove that another party has breached its rights.

Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), or lack personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant, see, e.g., Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 121-122, 134 S.Ct. 746, 187 L.Ed.2d 624 (2014). The plaintiff may lack a private right of action, see, e.g., Alexander v.

S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2587, 2609, 213 L.Ed.2d 896 (2022). If Congress wants the FLRA to have authority to enter an order against any of the petitioners, it must give the FLRA that authority. See American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 112-113, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946) (contemplating that an agency's remedy may be set aside where it is unwarranted in law).*",Alito,0,
2022-028,73,"Second, the Court reasons that petitioners, in supervising the technicians, exercise the authority of the Department of Defense, a covered agency. Ante, at 1199. The Court approvingly relates respondents' argument that, while petitioners may not be agencies, the components, representatives, and agents of an agency may be required to comply with the Statute. Ante, at 1198. The Court does not specify which of these three categories it thinks petitioners fall into. It says only that petitioners are like components of an agency. Ante, at 1199 (emphasis added). And it finds that they are like components of an agency because they supervise the technicians pursuant to a designation from the heads of the Departments  of the Army and the Air Force, which are themselves components of the Department of Defense. Ante, at 1199-1200. Since the Department of Defense is an agency, the Court reasons that the same must be true of petitioners.",Alito,0,
2022-028,74,"The problem with this reasoning is that a designation to exercise the authority of an agency does not turn the designee into an agency. Just because A is designated to exercise the authority of B, it does not follow that A is B. Here is an example. If an administrative hearing officer in the Department of the Interior is disqualified from hearing a case, that officer must report that information to the Secretary of the Interior or such officer as he may designate. 43 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis added). The designated officer does not become the Secretary by virtue of having been designated to carry out a duty or exercise authority that would otherwise rest with the Secretary.",Alito,0,
2022-028,75,The same is true here. The designation of petitioners by the Departments of the Army and Air Force to perform some of those departments' duties and to exercise some of their authority does not turn petitioners into agencies or necessarily have any effect beyond assigning them those duties and responsibilities. 32 U.S.C. § 709(d).,Alito,0,
2022-028,76,"The Court's related and highly functionalist argument that petitioners must be subject to the FLRA because they exercise the authority of an agency in supervising the technicians similarly fails. Ante, at 1199. One entity may augment the power of another by delegating to it certain authority. See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (JACKSON, J., concurring). That delegation of authority, however, does not turn the latter entity into the former one. That petitioners exercise authority that federal agencies would otherwise hold does not make them agencies any more than the President is Congress when he exercises authority pursuant to congressional authorization. See ibid.",Alito,0,
2022-028,77,"To be sure, the official who makes the designation cannot delegate authority that he or she does not have. If the FSLMRS constrains the Departments of the Army and Air Force in their relationship with the technicians, it stands to reason that those Departments cannot delegate to adjutants general the power to supervise the technicians free from such constraints. As I have explained, though, this case turns not on whether petitioners have obligations to bargain with the technicians, but on whether those obligations may be enforced against petitioners as if they are agencies. 5 U.S.C. § 7105(g)(3). And on that score, saying the Departments' designation transforms petitioners into agencies, with all the legal ramifications of that label, is no more sensible than saying the officer the Secretary of the Interior designates to receive disqualification notices becomes, like the Secretary of the Interior, a principal officer of the United States subject to Senate confirmation. U. S. Const., Art. II, § 2.",Alito,0,
2022-028,79,"Finally, the Court's reliance on the Statute's saving clause, § 7135(b), and on the Assistant Secretary of Labor's decision in Thompson Field, is both misplaced and unpersuasive on its own terms.

This language merely directs that, absent specific abrogation by the FSLMRS or reconsideration by the appropriate executive officer, prior administrative policies, regulations, and procedures remain just as binding on the Executive Branch as they were before the adoption of the FSLMRS. The Court appears to agree, describing the saving clause as having continued pre-FSLMRS administrative practice. Ante, at 1200.",Alito,0,
2022-028,81,"If that is all that the saving clause did, however, I fail to see why it is relevant here. Congress's directive to continue existing administrative practices does not evince approval of any particular practice or prevent a court from saying that a particular practice has been unlawful all along. The saving clause expressly intended to allow both the FLRA and the courts to disregard  earlier  interpretations of the Executive Order and did not intend for the FLRA or the courts to pay any deference to such earlier interpretations. INS v. FLRA, 855 F.2d 1454, 1461 (C.A.9 1988), see also Department of Air Force v. FLRA, 877 F.2d 1036, 1041 (C.A.D.C. 1989) (§ 7135 was merely intended to prevent the slate from being wiped clean until the FLRA and the courts could interpret the FSLMRS in a manner consistent with Congress's intent (internal quotation marks omitted)).

2022-028,82,"Although the majority's historical-practice argument is flawed at the foundation because it misreads § 7135(b), the single administrative decision it cites in support of its argument does not shed much light on the matter at hand anyway. In Thompson Field, the Adjutant General of the State of Mississippi raised a number of objections to federal oversight of the technicians, including that the technicians are not federal employees, that Executive Order No. 11491 is categorically not applicable to the State of Mississippi, and that bargaining with a technicians' union would violate Mississippi law.

Id., at 6-7. That analysis does not answer the key question whether the Mississippi Adjutant General is an agency subject to remedial jurisdiction. And while the Court quotes the Assistant Secretary's remark that the Adjutant General is `an agent of the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force,' ante, at 1200-1201, that observation was made in the course of rejecting the Adjutant General's argument that Mississippi law did not permit him to bargain with a labor organization. Thompson Field, at 7. The Assistant Secretary was not addressing the question whether being an agent of those Secretaries rendered the Adjutant General sufficiently like an agency to be subject to federal remedial jurisdiction.",Alito,0,

It is a bedrock rule, of course, that federal law preempts state law when the two conflict. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Preemption under the NLRA is unusual, though,  because our precedent maintains that the NLRA preempts state law even when the two only arguably conflict. San Diego Building Trades Council v.

This doctrine—named Garmon preemption after the case that originated it—thus goes beyond the usual preemption rule. Under Garmon, States cannot regulate conduct that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits. Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v.

Although Glacier quickly instructed drivers to finish deliveries in progress, the Union directed them to ignore Glacier's orders.

Bethany Medical Center, 328 N. L. R. B. 1094 (1999) (concerted activity is indefensible where employees fail to take reasonable precautions to protect the employer's plant, equipment, or products from foreseeable imminent danger due to sudden cessation of work), see also Brief for Petitioner 14, 30-31, Brief for Respondent 28-29, Reply Brief 6-7, Tr. of Oral Arg. 68, 86. Given this undisputed limitation on the right to strike, we proceed to consider whether the Union has demonstrated that the statute arguably protects the drivers' conduct. Davis, 476 U.S. at 395, 106 S.Ct. 1904. We conclude that it has not.2",Barrett,0,
2022-030,51,"The drivers engaged in a sudden cessation of work that put Glacier's property in foreseeable and imminent danger. The Union knew that concrete is highly perishable and that it can last for only a limited time in a delivery truck's rotating drum. It also knew that concrete left to harden in a truck's drum causes significant damage to the truck. The Union nevertheless coordinated with truck drivers to initiate the strike when Glacier was in the midst of batching large quantities of concrete and delivering it to customers. Predictably, the company's concrete was destroyed as a result. And though Glacier's swift action saved its trucks in the end, the risk of harm to its equipment was both foreseeable and serious. See NLRB v. Special Touch Home Care Services, Inc., 708 F.3d 447, 460 (CA2 2013) (The appropriate inquiry is focused on the risk of harm, not its realization).",Barrett,0,

It could have initiated the strike before Glacier's trucks were full of wet concrete—say, by instructing drivers to refuse to load their trucks in the first place. Once the strike was underway, nine of the Union's drivers abandoned their fully loaded trucks without telling anyone—which left the trucks on a path to destruction unless Glacier saw them in time to unload the concrete. Yet the Union did not take the simple step of alerting Glacier that these trucks had been returned. Nor, after the trucks were in the yard, did the Union direct its drivers to follow Glacier's instructions to facilitate a safe transfer of equipment. To be clear, the reasonable precautions test does not mandate any one action in particular. But the Union's  failure to take even minimal precautions illustrates its failure to fulfill its duty.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,53,"Indeed, far from taking reasonable precautions to mitigate foreseeable danger to Glacier's property, the Union executed the strike in a manner designed to compromise the safety of Glacier's trucks and destroy its concrete. Such conduct is not arguably protected by the NLRA, on the contrary, it goes well beyond the NLRA's protections. See NLRB v. Marshall Car Wheel & Foundry Co., 218 F.2d 409, 411, 413 (C.A.5 1955) (strike unprotected when employees abandoned their posts without warning when molten iron in the plant cupola was ready to be poured off, even though a lack of sufficient help to carry out the critical pouring operation might well have resulted in substantial property damage).",Barrett,0,
2022-030,54,"Thus, accepting the complaint's allegations as true, the Union did not take reasonable precautions to protect Glacier's property from imminent danger resulting from the drivers' sudden cessation of work. The state court thus erred in dismissing Glacier's tort claims as preempted on the pleadings.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,56,"The Union resists this conclusion. First, it emphasizes that the NLRA's protection of the right to strike should `be given a generous interpretation.'

A strike, it points out, consists of a concerted stoppage of work. § 142(2). So, the argument goes, by engaging in a concerted stoppage of work to support their economic demands, the drivers engaged in conduct arguably protected by § 7 of the NLRA.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,57,"This argument oversimplifies the NLRA.

Bethany Medical Center, 328 N. L. R. B., at 1094. So the mere fact that the drivers engaged in a concerted stoppage of work to support their economic demands does not end the analysis. We must also ask whether the strike exceeded the limits of the statute.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,58,"Second, the Union argues that workers do not forfeit the Act's protections simply by commencing a work stoppage at a time when the loss of perishable products is foreseeable. Brief for Respondent 22. It points out that the Board has found strikers' conduct protected even when their decision not to work created a risk that perishable goods would spoil. See, e.g., Lumbee Farms Coop., 285 N. L. R. B. 497 (1987) (raw poultry processing workers), enf'd, 850 F.2d 689 (C.A.4 1988), Central Oklahoma Milk Producers Assoc., 125 N. L. R.

If the mere risk of spoilage is enough to render a strike illegal, the Union insists, then workers who deal with perishable goods will have no meaningful right to strike.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,59,"The Union is swinging at a straw man. It casts this case as one involving nothing more than a foreseeable risk that the employer's perishable products would spoil. But given the lifespan of wet concrete, Glacier could not batch it until a truck was ready to take it. So by reporting for duty and pretending as if they would deliver the concrete, the drivers prompted the creation of the perishable product. Then, they waited to walk off the job until the concrete was mixed and poured in the trucks. In so doing, they not only destroyed the  concrete but also put Glacier's trucks in harm's way. This case therefore involves much more than a work stoppage at a time when the loss of perishable products is foreseeable. Brief for Respondent 22.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,60,"Third, the Union maintains that the timing of the strike and Glacier's lack of notice cannot render the drivers' conduct unprotected. Id., at 26-28.

B., at 506, and that the NLRA does not impose a legal requirement that workers give specific notice of a strike's timing, see Columbia Portland Cement Co. v. NLRB, 915 F.2d 253, 257 (CA6 1990).",Barrett,0,
2022-030,61,"We agree that the Union's decision to initiate the strike during the workday and failure to give Glacier specific notice do not themselves render its conduct unprotected. Still, they are relevant considerations in evaluating whether strikers took reasonable precautions, whether harm to property was imminent, and whether that danger was foreseeable. See International Protective Services, Inc., 339 N. L. R. B. 701, 702-703 (2003) (attempt `to capitalize on the element of surprise' stemming from a lack of notice weighed in favor of concluding that a union failed to take reasonable precautions). In this instance, the Union's choice to call a strike after its drivers had loaded a large amount of wet concrete into Glacier's delivery trucks strongly suggests that it failed to take reasonable precautions to avoid foreseeable, aggravated, and imminent harm to Glacier's property.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,62,"Finally, the Union points out that the drivers returned the trucks to Glacier's facility. And it maintains that all of the drivers left the drums of their trucks rotating, which delayed the concrete's hardening process. In the Union's view, this establishes that the drivers took reasonable precautions to protect the trucks. Brief for Respondent 28-30.",Barrett,0,
2022-030,63,"We see it differently. That the drivers returned the trucks to Glacier's facility does not do much for the Union—refraining from stealing an employer's vehicles does not demonstrate that one took reasonable precautions to protect them. And Glacier's allegations do not support the Union's assertion that all of the drivers left the drums rotating. The Union relies on a vague remark by an unspecified Union agent to another unspecified person to leave a truck running. See id., at 9, 30, Brief for Petitioner 8, App. 34. This snippet does not show that all of the drivers left their trucks running, and even if it did, that would not necessarily mean that the delivery trucks' drums continued rotating. In any event, Glacier alleged that if concrete remains in a ready-mix truck for too long, it will harden and cause significant damage to the truck. The rotating drum forestalls that hardening for a time, but not indefinitely. And the Union concedes that the NLRA does not arguably protect its actions if they posed a material risk of harm to the trucks. Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.3* * *  Glacier alleges that the drivers' conduct created an emergency in which it had to devise a way to offload concrete in a timely manner to avoid costly damage to its mixer trucks. App. 72. The Union's actions not only resulted in the destruction of all the concrete Glacier had prepared that day, they also posed a risk of foreseeable, aggravated, and imminent harm to Glacier's trucks. Because the Union took affirmative steps to endanger Glacier's property rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk, the NLRA does not arguably protect its conduct. We reverse the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",Barrett,0,

2022-030,68,"As the majority notes, however, Garmon goes beyond the usual preemption rule. Ante, at 1411. In Garmon, the Court determined that, when an activity is arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the Act (which, respectively, concern employees' right to engage in concerted activity and unfair labor practices), the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board). 359 U.S. at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773. The Court went on to explain that this prophylactic rule of pre-emption may apply even to state-court claims arising under state private law (rather than the NLRA or a comparable state regulatory scheme) and even to claims seeking remedies not available from the Board. Id., at 246-248, 79 S.Ct. 773.* Nor, under the Court's rule, is the State's power to act restored if the NLRB fails to determine the status of the disputed conduct by declining to assert jurisdiction, or by refusal  to file a charge, or by adopting some other disposition which does not define the nature of the activity with unclouded legal significance. Id., at 245-246, 79 S.Ct. 773.",Thomas,0,

Id., at 253-254, 79 S.Ct. 773. The years since have borne out that warning. Garmon elevates even the remotest possibility of conflict, thereby overstating the likelihood and significance of conflicts and  setting up an unreal goal of doctrinal and factual harmony. L. Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1037, 1053 (1964). In effect, Garmon doctrine completely pre-empts state-court jurisdiction unless the Board determines that the disputed conduct is neither protected nor prohibited by the NLRA. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.

2022-030,71,"The majority opinion today underscores the strangeness of the Garmon regime. Here, the Supreme Court of the United States reassures a state court of its power to adjudicate a state-law tort claim. The Court does so, not based on its own judgment that federal law does not pre-empt the claim, but because the NLRB's existing precedents adequately remove any cloud over the matter. 359 U.S. at 246, 79 S.Ct. 773. But, if the Board's precedents left the matter arguable (and the NLRA did not plainly dictate an answer), then the state courts would be ousted of jurisdiction.

The upshot of this approach appears to be that the scope of the NLRA's pre-emption of state-court jurisdiction over state claims is defined—not by the statutory text—but by penumbras that wax and wane as the Board develops, or declines to develop, its own carefully insulated common law of labor relations.

In doing so, I would bear in mind that any proper pre-emption inquiry must focus on the NLRA's text and ask whether federal law and state law are in logical contradiction, such that it is impossible to comply with both.

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects the right to strike, but that right is subject to certain limitations and qualifications, see 29 U.S.C. § 163, and this Court's decisions make clear that the Act does not protect striking employees who engage in the type of conduct alleged here.",Alito,0,

2022-030,78,"The right to strike is fundamental to American labor law. Congress enshrined that right in the National Labor Relations  Act (NLRA) and simultaneously established the National Labor Relations Board to adjudicate disputes that arise between workers and management. That decision reflected Congress's judgment that an agency with specialized expertise should develop and enforce national labor law in a uniform manner, through case-by-case adjudication. For its part, this Court has scrupulously guarded the Board's authority for more than half a century. See San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959). Under Garmon, and as relevant here, a court presented with a tort suit based on strike conduct generally must pause proceedings and permit the Board to determine in the first instance whether the union's conduct is lawful if the conduct at issue is even arguably protected by the NLRA. Id., at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,79,"Today, the Court falters. As the majority acknowledges, the Board's General Counsel has filed a complaint with the Board after a thorough factual investigation, and that complaint alleges that the NLRA protects the strike conduct at the center of this state-court tort suit. The logical implication of a General Counsel complaint under Garmon is that the union's conduct is at least arguably protected by the NLRA. Consequently, where (as here) there is a General Counsel complaint pending before the Board, courts—including this Court—should suspend their examination. Garmon makes clear that we have no business delving into this particular labor dispute at this time.",Jackson,0,

As part of this mistaken expedition, the majority tries its own hand at applying the Board's decisions to a relatively novel scenario that poses difficult line-drawing questions—fact-sensitive issues that Congress plainly intended for the Board to address after an investigation. And in the course of inappropriately weighing in on the merits of those questions at this stage, the majority also misapplies the Board's cases in a manner that threatens to both impede the Board's uniform development of labor law and erode the right to strike.",Jackson,0,

A proper understanding of Garmon's foundation sheds considerable light on the majority's sequential missteps in this case.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,85,"Congress's passage of the NLRA marked a fundamental change in the Nation's labor policies. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 190, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978). Prior to that point, union activity had been viewed as a species of `conspiracy,' prompting substantial conflict between labor and management. Ibid. With the enactment of the  NLRA in 1935, Congress expressly recognized that collective organization of segments of the labor force into bargaining units capable of exercising economic power comparable to that possessed by employers may produce benefits for the entire economy in the form of higher wages, job security, and improved working conditions.

The regional director investigates the charge. § 101.4. If the charge appears to have merit and efforts to dispose of it by informal adjustment are unsuccessful, the regional director issues a complaint on behalf of the General Counsel. § 101.8. When a General Counsel's complaint issues, an administrative law judge (ALJ) holds a hearing and issues a decision, which the Board reviews if any party files an exception. §§ 101.8-101.12.

2022-030,93,"The history and structure of the NLRA make clear that Congress entrusted administration of the labor policy for the Nation to a centralized administrative agency—the Board—armed with its own procedures, and equipped with its specialized knowledge and cumulative experience. Garmon, 359 U.S. at 242, 79 S.Ct. 773. Congress thought the Board's primary role was necessary to obtain uniform application of the NLRA's substantive rules and to avoid the diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies. Garner, 346 U.S. at 490, 74 S.Ct. 161. That judgment makes perfect sense. The NLRA's substantive principles are intrinsically broad and potentially conflicting, leaving much for future articulation through case-by-case adjudication. Drawing the line between activities that constitute a protected strike, on the one hand, and unprotected actions for which employers may validly discipline employees, on the other, is a legally and factually complex task. Moreover, that task implicates important economic policy considerations about the relative bargaining power of labor and management that affect not only the parties to a particular labor dispute but also our broader national economy.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,94,"To effect Congress's intent, this Court has consistently recognized that courts are not primary tribunals to adjudicate these issues. Garmon, 359 U.S. at 244, 79 S.Ct. 773.

And the Board, if it is to accomplish the task which Congress set for it, necessarily must have authority  to fill the interstices of the broad statutory provisions. Id., at 501, 98 S.Ct. 2463. So, while the Board's decision is not the last word on these complex matters—given that its decisions are subject to review in federal court—it must assuredly be the first. Marine Engineers v.

Sears, Roebuck & Co., 436 U.S. at 203, 98 S.Ct. 1745. If the Board determines (subject to judicial review) that § 7 protects the union's conduct, normal conflict preemption kicks in: A state court may not hold a union liable on state-law claims for conduct that is protected by the NLRA.

Petitioner Glacier Northwest is a concrete-delivery company, and respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union No. 174 (Union) represents Glacier's concrete-delivery truckdrivers. After the drivers went on strike, Glacier sent disciplinary letters to some of the drivers.

Glacier sought, and we granted, certiorari to review that decision. Notably, however, after the Washington Supreme Court issued its decision, the regional director acting on behalf of the Board's General Counsel filed an administrative complaint against Glacier. In my view, for the reasons explained below, that subsequent event has greatly simplified the Garmon question.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,104,"The filing of the General Counsel's administrative complaint necessarily suffices to establish that the Union's strike conduct is arguably protected within the meaning of Garmon. Thus, the General Counsel's  complaint should have marked the end of any court involvement in this matter at this time.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,105,"The General Counsel's complaint alleges that Glacier interfered with strike conduct protected by § 7 when it disciplined its drivers for walking off the job and when it filed this tort suit. That complaint represents the General Counsel's conclusion—reached after an extensive independent investigation involving collecting testimony and other evidence, and after careful consideration of the competing legal principles and policy concerns—that the Union's claim that its strike conduct was protected appears to have merit. 29 C.F.R. §§ 101.4, 101.8. One cannot credibly contend that a claim that makes it through this gauntlet does not concern conduct `arguably' protected by the NLRA. Davis Supermarkets, Inc. v.

2022-030,106,"A court presented with a General Counsel complaint should therefore find Garmon inherently satisfied. This is so because the entire point of Garmon's arguably-protected test is to permit the court to assess the facts and relevant labor law in service of a gatekeeping function. The answer to the Garmon question simply (and solely) establishes whether the court can continue to entertain a lawsuit that relates to the challenged strike conduct, or whether the legal action must be suspended to allow the Board to make an initial assessment of the matter. The court evaluates the existing evidence and the law for a specific reason: to determine whether the lawsuit attacks arguably-protected conduct such that entertaining the legal action will interfere with the Board's prerogative to develop the facts and adjudicate the merits of the dispute as part of the Board's broader authority to develop national labor law.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,107,"If the General Counsel investigates the matter and files a complaint with the Board alleging that the union's conduct is protected, it becomes indisputable that the pending legal action might interfere with the Board's authority. Thus, a General Counsel complaint relieves the court of the burden of having to make the arguably-protected assessment based on its own understanding of the evidence and labor law—it is arguable that the union's conduct is protected because the General Counsel is arguing just that. To be sure, we have said that the arguably-protected test is not without substance and is not satisfied by a conclusory assertion of pre-emption. Davis, 476 U.S. at 394, 106 S.Ct. 1904. But an allegation from the Board's General Counsel after a thorough investigation is a far cry from a conclusory assertion of protection.2",Jackson,0,

On January 12, 2023, an ALJ denied Glacier's motion to postpone the ALJ hearing on the General Counsel's complaint pending this Court's decision in this case. As the ALJ explained, the General Counsel's pleading constituted a determination that the strikers' conduct was at least arguably protected by the NLRA and that this agency became the exclusive forum for adjudicating whether the strikers' conduct was protected.3 A nine-day hearing ensued,  and the parties completed posthearing briefing last week. We have said that the need for protecting the exclusivity of the Board's jurisdiction is obviously greatest when the precise issue brought before a court is in the process of litigation through procedures originating in the Board. Marine Engineers, 370 U.S. at 185, 82 S.Ct. 1237. That is exactly the situation here.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,109,"For these reasons, I believe that the filing of the General Counsel's complaint is more than sufficient to trigger Garmon's pause, and that it must be so if consistency with Congress's intent to give the Board primary authority to interpret and enforce the NLRA is to be maintained.

Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005)), the majority declines to do so in the first instance. Ante, at 1415, n. 3.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,114,"This rationale is inconsistent with the broader approach that the majority takes in this case. It would be one thing if the Court simply noted the filing of the General Counsel's complaint and authorized the lower courts to evaluate the impact of that complaint on the Garmon question in the first instance. But it goes further: The majority also inserts itself into the midst of this labor dispute now (despite the General Counsel's complaint), proceeding to apply the Board's cases to novel and difficult line-drawing questions and ultimately concluding that the strike conduct alleged in Glacier's complaint is not even arguably protected.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,115,"The majority cannot have it both ways. A concern about the Court's institutional role justifies, at most, vacating the judgment below and remanding for the lower court to consider the import of the General Counsel's complaint. The same observation that compels the majority to allow for such lower-court consideration—that we are `a court of review, not of first view,' ante, at 1415, n. 3—should have likewise led it to decline to intrude into this labor dispute while it is pending before the Board.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,117,"For the reasons discussed above, I would have vacated the Washington Supreme Court's judgment and remanded with directions to stay proceedings or dismiss Glacier's complaint without prejudice, on the straightforward ground that the General Counsel's complaint triggers the jurisdictional hiatus that Garmon requires.4  The majority sidesteps my preferred resolution of this matter and instead proceeds to engage in Garmon's arguably protected test by applying a series of fact-intensive Board decisions to the bare allegations in Glacier's state-court complaint. To do this, the majority invokes the Board's reasonable precautions principle. Ante, at 1412-1414. That principle (discussed in Part IV, infra) is derived from the Board's determination that striking workers must take reasonable precautions to protect persons, the employer's premises, and its equipment from foreseeable, aggravated, and imminent harm due to the sudden cessation of work. The majority has taken it upon itself to apply the Board's reasonable-precautions principle to the factual allegations about the Union's conduct that Glacier alleges in this lawsuit, and it thereby concludes that the drivers' conduct is not even arguably protected by the NLRA.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,118,This course of action (which is already confounding given that the Board itself is currently considering the challenged strike conduct with the benefit of developed facts and labor law expertise) reflects an analytical approach to the issues presented that cannot be squared with Garmon.,Jackson,0,
2022-030,120,"Whether the NLRA protects particular strike conduct often turns on subtle factual disputes and nuanced legal distinctions. Here, for example, whether the Union's strike conduct is protected or unprotected might well depend on whether the drivers left the concrete-delivery trucks' revolving drums turning when they walked off the job. So, too, might it depend on fine legal gradations concerning how imminent or how aggravated the risk of harm must be to trigger the duty to take reasonable precautions. These kinds of determinations cry out for evidentiary hearings, and in this highly fact-sensitive area of the law, which generally develops on a case-by-case basis, the scope of NLRA protection in a given set of circumstances is typically determined once the facts have been established—through discovery, debate, and sometimes the tedious work of making contentious credibility determinations.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,121,"Fortunately, in this regard, Congress has gifted our legal system with an expert agency that thoroughly investigates what happened—i.e., the facts of strike-related labor disputes—and then engages in the initial task of answering the sometimes complex, always fact-bound question whether the NLRA protects the strike conduct at issue. Meanwhile, a court that is undertaking Garmon's arguably-protected analysis is engaged in a fundamentally different inquiry. As explained in Part II-A, supra, while the court is most certainly considering strike conduct arising from a labor dispute, it is not meant to address the merits of these complex questions. Under the NLRA and Garmon, courts must take as a given that the Board is the entity to which Congress has assigned responsibility for initially determining what happened and taking the first crack at deciding whether the NLRA protects the union's conduct. And far from usurping that Board function, Garmon tasks the court with merely conducting a threshold, gatekeeping assessment of whether the lawsuit before it must be paused, or whether the suit can proceed because it is not even arguable that the conduct at issue in the lawsuit is protected by the NLRA.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,122,"To avoid veering into the Board's assigned territory, it is crucial that the courts have a clear understanding of the nature of the Garmon assessment and what it requires. The court asks, first of all, whether the party invoking Garmon has advanced an interpretation of the NLRA that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been `authoritatively rejected' by the courts or the Board. Davis, 476 U.S. at 395, 106 S.Ct. 1904. This inquiry involves merely comparing the union's claim about the scope of its protection to the broad protective language of the statute and deciding whether the union's interpretation has already been definitively rejected either by courts or by the Board.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,123,"The second task is to determine whether the party invoking Garmon has put forth enough evidence to enable the court to find that the Board reasonably could uphold a claim based on such an interpretation. Davis, 476 U.S. at 395, 106 S.Ct. 1904. Again, this is not an invitation to supplant the Board's factfinding role or to usurp the authority that Congress has given the Board to make the initial underlying protected-or-unprotected determination. Rather, the point of this part of the Garmon assessment is simply to determine whether it is arguable that the Board—in the exercise of its discretion to develop labor law and aided by its investigation into the facts—could conclude that the strike conduct at issue is protected by the NLRA. See 359 U.S. at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,124,"Thus, consistent with a statutory scheme that gives primacy to the agency's expertise, a court's task under Garmon is unmistakably modest. It must merely assess whether, in light of existing law and the evidence that has been amassed related to this strike, it is possible that the union could prevail before the Board. Put another way, instead of stepping into the Board's shoes as primary factfinder, or even prognosticating about what the Board is likely to decide concerning the extent of NLRA coverage, a court that stands down upon a proper Garmon analysis has simply determined (1) that existing law does not plainly and authoritatively prohibit the strike conduct at issue, and (2) that evidence exists concerning how the strike was conducted that might ultimately favor the union, such that the lawsuit should pause to allow the Board to gather the facts and apply its expertise to determine whether the strike was lawful.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,126,"The majority seems to misunderstand all this in the context of this case. It correctly concludes that the Union has carried its burden of advancing an interpretation of the NLRA that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been authoritatively rejected by the courts or the Board. Ante, at 1412-1413 (internal quotation marks omitted). But it finds that the Union has failed to satisfy the second Garmon step, and it does so after undertaking its own assessment of the facts alleged in Glacier's complaint and endeavoring to apply the Board's fact-bound reasonable-precautions precedents. See, e.g., ante, at 1413 (determining, based on alleged facts, that the drivers engaged in a sudden cessation of work that put Glacier's property in foreseeable and imminent danger and that the risk of harm to the concrete-delivery trucks was both foreseeable and serious), ibid. (concluding that the Union failed to `take reasonable precautions,' after hypothesizing various steps that, according to the majority, the Union should have taken but did not).",Jackson,0,
2022-030,127,"Given what I have already said about Garmon's purpose and what it calls for, the majority's error in proceeding in this fashion is obvious. To my mind, if a court  that is evaluating what to do per Garmon finds itself weighing in on such fact-bound matters as whether the strike posed a risk of harm that was aggravated enough or imminent enough to remove NLRA protection, or starts contemplating whether the precautions that the striking employees took to address any such risk were reasonable enough to allow them to retain the right to strike, it has unwittingly wandered into a domain that Congress intentionally assigned to the Board to address in the first instance.5",Jackson,0,
2022-030,128,"It is clear to me that Congress plainly intended for the Board's factfinding function to be at the forefront of this kind of legal evaluation. Thus, in my view, when a court undertakes the Garmon analysis in a context such as this one, it should take care to limit itself to its own assigned responsibility: the mere determination of whether, given the union's evidence and legal interpretation, the Board could possibly conclude that the union had taken reasonable precautions. If yes, the court should suspend the pending legal action to let the Board decide the question. To conclude no, given the fact-bound nature of the reasonable-precautions analysis, a court in all but the most exceptional circumstances will need to be able to point to a reasonable-precautions case from the Board that is on all fours with the facts of the case before it and that found the conduct unprotected. In that circumstance, the court can proceed with the suit, without breaking new legal ground on the scope of the right to strike.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,129,"In all events, then, courts can properly decide the Garmon issue without making law in this area, precisely as Congress intended. Indeed, I think we best respect congressional intent regarding the Board's authority to develop uniform labor law by leaving the application of the Board's reasonable-precautions principle to the Board itself. The majority's contrary approach opens up the possibility that courts around the country will now act on bare allegations to generate conflicting results about the contours of the venerated right to strike, which, ironically, was the primary concern that motivated Congress to create the Board in the first place.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,131,"For what it's worth, even if the majority's approach to deciding the Garmon question were the correct one, the majority misapplies the reasonable-precautions principle to the allegations here in a manner that threatens to impinge on the right to strike and on the orderly development of labor law.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,134,"A strike, by definition, is a concerted stoppage of work by employees, or any concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by employees. §142(2). When employees stop working, production may halt, deliveries may be delayed, and services may be canceled. At the risk of stating the obvious, this means that the workers' right to strike inherently  includes the right to impose economic harm on their employer.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,135,"Congress was well aware that organized labor's exercise of the right to strike risks harm to an employer's economic interests. See § 151, NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 221, 234, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 10 L.Ed.2d 308 (1963) (Congress's protection of the right to strike reflects its understanding that strikes are authorized economic weapons). Yet, Congress protected that right anyway. In fact, the threat of economic harm posed by the right to strike is a feature, not a bug, of the NLRA. The potential pain of a work stoppage is a powerful tool, and one that unquestionably advances Congress's codified goal of achieving equality of bargaining power between employers and employees. § 151. Unions leverage a strike's economic harm (or the threat of it) into bargaining power, and then wield that power to demand improvement of employees' wages and working conditions—goals that, according to Congress, benefit the economy writ large. See Sears, Roebuck & Co., 436 U.S. at 190, 98 S.Ct. 1745.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,136,"Still, the right to strike is, of course, not unlimited. But when Congress chose to qualify the use of the strike, it did so by prescribing the limits and conditions of the abridgment in exacting detail. Erie Resistor, 373 U.S. at 234, 83 S.Ct. 1139. Section 8 enumerates several limitations. For example, a union must notify an employer that it intends to terminate or modify its contract—and thus that a strike is possible—at least 60 days before striking. § 158(d). A union cannot strike for unlawful purposes, such as putting economic pressure on parties other than the primary employer. § 158(b)(4)(i)(B). And, in certain healthcare settings, unions must provide at least 10 days' notice of the precise date and time of a strike. § 158(g).",Jackson,0,
2022-030,137,"Additionally, § 163 of the NLRA (which Congress added via the 1947 Taft-Hartley Amendments, 61 Stat. 151) states that nothing in this subchapter, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,138,"Thus, the text of the NLRA allows for only two kinds of limitations on the right to strike: those enumerated in the Act itself, and the limitations or qualifications on the right that existed when the Taft-Hartley Amendments were enacted. See NLRB v. Drivers, 362 U.S. 274, 281-282, 80 S.Ct. 706, 4 L.Ed.2d 710 (1960). The only relevant limitation here is the one set out in NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U.S. 240, 59 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed. 627 (1939).6",Jackson,0,
2022-030,139,"Our Fansteel decision stands for the principle that employees have the right to strike but they have no license to commit acts of violence or to seize their employer's plant. Id., at 253, 59 S.Ct. 490. The facts of that case involved 95 striking employees who effected a sit-down strike by taking over and holding two of their employer's key buildings. Id., at 248, 59 S.Ct. 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). The employees subsequently engaged in a pitched battle in which they resisted the attempt by the sheriff to evict and arrest them. Id., at 249, 59 S.Ct. 490. We  held that the NLRA did not condone this conduct, which would put a premium on resort to force and would subvert the principles of law and order which lie at the foundations of society. Id., at 253, 59 S.Ct. 490.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,140,"Congress's incorporation of Fansteel's limitation into the NLRA establishes that, while employees have the right to withhold their labor peaceably, subsequent affirmative acts of violence, or seizure of an employer's premises, are not protected labor practices.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,142,"As a general matter, the dispute in this case is over whether employees can withhold their labor if doing so risks damage to their employer's property. As explained above, by carefully restricting limitations on the right to strike in the NLRA itself, Congress has indicated that the act of peacefully walking off the job is protected strike conduct even if economic harm incidentally results. What is not protected is any subsequent affirmative step to destroy or seize the employer's property. This is the statutory backdrop against which the Board has developed the narrow requirement that striking employees must take reasonable precautions before or when they strike in order to forestall or address foreseeable, imminent, and aggravated injury to persons, premises, and equipment that might otherwise be caused by their sudden cessation of work.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,143,"The Board first applied this reasonable precautions principle to rank-and-file employees in Marshall Car Wheel & Foundry Co., Inc., 107 N. L. R. B. 314, 315 (1953), enf. denied on other grounds, 218 F.2d 409 (C.A.5 1955). There, employees at a foundry walked off the job at a time when the foundry's furnace was full of hot molten iron, threatening severe damage to the employer's plant and equipment. 107 N. L. R. B., at 315. The Board concluded that the employees' strike conduct was not protected by the NLRA, because the employees had a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect the employer's physical plant from such imminent damage as foreseeably would result from their sudden cessation of work. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,144,"The Board has also applied this principle in other similar cases. It determined, for example, that strikers who walked out of a certain kind of chemical plant—a plant that handled extremely hazardous chemicals that were a hazard not only to employees but also to individuals living in the vicinity—without shutting down the equipment had engaged in unprotected conduct. General Chemical Corp., 290 N. L. R. B. 76, 77, 83 (1988). Similarly, the Board held that the strike conduct of security guards whose walkout exposed a federal building's occupants to imminent danger was not protected by the NLRA. International Protective Servs., Inc., 339 N. L. R. B. 701, 703 (2003).",Jackson,0,
2022-030,145,But the narrow duty that Marshall Car Wheel and its progeny impose does not—and cannot—displace the general rule that labor strikes are protected even when the workers' withdrawal of their labor inflicts economic harm on the employer. So the Board has also repeatedly held that employees have no duty to prevent the loss of perishable goods caused by their sudden cessation of work.,Jackson,0,
2022-030,146,"In a leading case, employees at a raw poultry plant decided to walk out at 8 a.m. because by that time all employees would have reported to work and the employer would be in full operation with its largest number of chickens on the line. Lumbee Farms Co-op., 285 N. L. R. B. 497, 503 (1987). The Board affirmed the ALJ's reasoning that the fact that the strike occurred during the workday when chickens were on the line and vulnerable to loss  does not mean employees automatically lost protection under the Act, because strikers are not required under the Act to institute the strike at a specific time of day. Id., at 506. Indeed, it is normal for planned employee strikes to be timed to ensure the greatest impact on an employer. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,147,"The Board has applied this same reasoning in cases involving, for example, cheese and milk. See Leprino Cheese Co., 170 N. L. R. B. 601, 605 (1968), Central Okla. Milk Producers Assn., 125 N. L. R. B. 419, 435 (1959). In those cases, the Board also explained that the reasonable-precautions principle is limited to situations involving a danger of `aggravated' injury to persons or premises—a danger obviously not posed by the loss of, for example, cheese. Leprino Cheese, 170 N. L. R. B., at 607 (emphasis added). The Board has consistently reiterated that loss is not uncommon when a strike occurs. Central Okla. Milk Producers, 125 N. L. R. B., at 435.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,148,"In short, it is indisputable that workers have a statutory right to strike despite the fact that exercising that right risks economic harm to employers. Congress has, in effect, drawn a line between those economic harms that are inherent in the act of peacefully walking off the job (which do not render the strike unprotected), and those that result from workers taking subsequent affirmative steps to seize the employer's premises or engage in acts of violence (strike conduct that is not protected by the NLRA). The Board has further recognized a narrow duty that arises if a sudden cessation of work risks foreseeable, imminent, and aggravated harm to persons, premises, or equipment. Beyond this narrow reasonable-precautions requirement, however, employees have no obligation to protect their employer's economic interests when they exercise the right to withhold their labor.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,150,"Glacier does not allege that the cement truckdrivers committed acts of violence or seized its plant or property as part of the strike the Union orchestrated. Instead, the thrust of its complaint is that the Union was aware of the perishable nature of batched concrete, App. 9, and that the drivers' walkout was intentionally timed so as to risk harm to that product. See id., at 10 (alleging sabotage, ruination and destruction of Glacier's batched concrete).",Jackson,0,
2022-030,151,"I agree with the majority that the risk of losing the batched concrete alone would not be sufficient to divest the striking drivers of statutory protection. As Glacier acknowledges, wet concrete is a perishable good. Ibid. And the Board has repeatedly reaffirmed that the loss of such perishable goods due to a mere work stoppage does not render a strike unprotected.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,152,"There is also no duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent this kind of economic loss, which—standing alone—posed no risk to persons, premises, or equipment, let alone a risk of aggravated harm. While it seems that the drivers were in a position to save the batched concrete that was inside their trucks when the strike was called (by, for instance, continuing to deliver it to the intended customers), that is beside the point. Employees have a protected right to withhold their labor. And it would undercut that right if they could be held liable for the incidental loss of the perishable goods (which includes concrete no less than raw poultry, cheese, or milk) that they tend to as part of their job.7  Where I disagree with the majority is the conclusion it draws from the fact that the batched concrete also risked harm to the drivers' trucks, at least as alleged in Glacier's complaint. The majority repeatedly ties the loss of the concrete—in particular, the risk that it would harden in the trucks—to the alleged risk of harm to the delivery trucks themselves.8 But, to me, the alleged risk of harm to Glacier's trucks involves a relatively complex factual analysis under the Board's reasonable-precautions principle.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,153,"Glacier alleges that, once at rest, concrete begins hardening immediately, and depending on the mix can begin to set within 20 to 30 minutes. Id., at 8. Its complaint also asserts that if batched concrete remains in the revolving drum of the ready-mix truck beyond its useful life span, the batched concrete is certain or substantially certain to harden in the revolving drum and cause significant damage to the concrete ready-mix truck. Id., at 9. But Glacier's own submissions in Washington state court suggest that the Union instructed the drivers to return their trucks to Glacier's yard after the strike began and to keep the ready-mix trucks running. See id., at 34, 77. Glacier's submissions also suggest that those precautions actually provided the company's managers and nonstriking employees with sufficient time to decide how to address the situation to prevent any harm to the trucks. See id., at 13, 72, 77, 82-83.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,154,"Was any risk of harm to the trucks here imminent, given the allegation that the Union instructed the drivers to keep the trucks running? Is the risk of concrete hardening in a delivery truck aggravated, in the way Marshall Car Wheel contemplates? Was returning the trucks to the employer's premises and leaving them running a sufficient reasonable precaution, because it gave the employer sufficient time to address any risk of harm? Making the call about whether the NLRA protects the Union's conduct raises these questions and others. Importantly, these kinds of questions not only involve making nuanced factual distinctions but also demonstrate that applying the Board's reasonable-precautions precedents is, at bottom, a line-drawing exercise. Under circumstances like these, a court can confidently declare that a union's conduct is not even arguably protected for Garmon purposes only where the allegations make out a clear Fansteel claim or where the alleged facts implicate a reasonable-precautions case that is directly on point. Because neither is true here, the Court should have  concluded that the Union's conduct was at least arguably protected.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,155,"Even if the Court's task under Garmon were to apply the Board's reasonable-precautions principle to the allegations of Glacier's complaint and decide whether or not the Union engaged in unprotected conduct (to reiterate: that is not the assignment, see Part III-A, supra), I cannot agree with the majority's conclusion that the risk to the trucks rendered the drivers' strike unprotected by the NLRA. Instead, I would have credited Glacier's own account, and thus would have concluded that the Union took reasonable precautions when it instructed the drivers to return the trucks and leave them running to avoid the concrete hardening imminently in the drums. The majority reaches the opposite conclusion by giving far too little weight to the allegation that the drivers returned the trucks, and also by substantially discounting the allegations that support the Union's claim that the drivers left their trucks and revolving drums running. See ante, at 1415.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,156,"Fortunately, the pending Board determination of what actually happened in connection with this particular strike will establish—as a matter of fact and not mere allegation—what precautions (if any) the drivers actually took and what harm (if any) the Union's conduct actually posed to Glacier's trucks.9 But our different takes on these allegations only underscore the potential for variable outcomes when courts apply the Board's fact-dependent principles to bare assertions.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,157,"To the extent that the majority's conclusion rests on the alleged fact that by reporting for duty and pretending as if they would deliver the concrete, the drivers prompted the creation of the perishable product that put Glacier's trucks in harm's way, ante, at 1414-1415, I see nothing aggravated or even untoward about that conduct. Glacier is a concrete-delivery company whose drivers are responsible for delivering wet concrete, so it is unremarkable that the drivers struck at a time when there was concrete in the trucks. While selling perishable products may be risky business, the perishable nature of Glacier's concrete did not impose some obligation on the drivers to strike in the middle of the night or before the next day's jobs had started. To the contrary, it was entirely lawful for the drivers to start their workday per usual, and for the Union to time the strike to put maximum pressure on the employer at minimum economic cost to the union. NLRB v. Insurance Agents', 361 U.S. 477, 496, 80 S.Ct. 419, 4 L.Ed.2d 454 (1960), see also Lumbee Farms Co-op., 285 N. L. R. B., at 506.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,158,"Nor was the onus of protecting Glacier's economic interests if a strike was called in the middle of the day on the drivers—it was, instead, on Glacier, which could have taken any number of prophylactic, mitigating measures.10 What Glacier seeks to do here is to shift the duty of protecting an employer's property from damage or loss incident to a strike onto the striking workers,  beyond what the Board has already permitted via the reasonable-precautions principle. In my view, doing that places a significant burden on the employees' exercise of their statutory right to strike, unjustifiably undermining Congress's intent. Workers are not indentured servants, bound to continue laboring until any planned work stoppage would be as painless as possible for their master. They are employees whose collective and peaceful decision to withhold their labor is protected by the NLRA even if economic injury results.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-030,159,"Today, the majority fails, in multiple respects, to heed Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes, despite ostensibly applying Garmon, the bedrock case on that issue. The Court's ruling is likely to cause considerable confusion among the lower courts about what Garmon requires. And any such confusion not only threatens to encroach upon the Board's prerogatives, as Congress has assigned them, but also risks erosion of the right to strike.",Jackson,0,
2022-030,160,"Yet, the posture of this case provides an opportunity to mitigate the results of the majority's errors. On remand, the state court should dismiss Glacier's complaint without prejudice or stay its proceedings in view of the General Counsel's complaint. Meanwhile, the Board—which is not bound by the allegations in Glacier's complaint when making its assessment, and is well equipped to make findings of fact concerning the strike conduct at issue—should proceed to determine whether Glacier has interfered with strike conduct that is protected by the NLRA, as alleged by the General Counsel.",Jackson,0,
2022-031,24,"A recently enacted federal statute establishes a financial oversight board within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's government. The question presented is whether the statute categorically abrogates (legalspeak for eliminates) any sovereign immunity the board enjoys from legal claims. We hold it does not. Under long-settled law, Congress must use unmistakable language to abrogate sovereign immunity. Nothing in the statute creating the board meets that high bar.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,26,"Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), 48 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., to deal with a fiscal emergency. Puerto Rico's public debt had soared, to more than the annual output of the island's economy. The Commonwealth could not service that level of debt through the bond markets. And it was not eligible to restructure debt under the Federal Bankruptcy Code. PROMESA offered a path out of the crisis, helping Puerto Rico to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets. § 2121(a). The idea was to set up a system for overseeing Puerto Rico's finances, while also enabling the Commonwealth to gain bankruptcy protections similar to those available under the Code. See Financial Oversight and Management Bd. for Puerto Rico v. Aurelius Investment, LLC, 590 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 1649, 1655-1656, 207 L.Ed.2d 18 (2020).",Kagan,0,
2022-031,27,"PROMESA creates, as its centerpiece, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico—the petitioner here. The statute describes the seven-member Board as an entity within the territorial government of Puerto Rico. § 2121(c)(1).

Under PROMESA, the Board approves and enforces the Commonwealth's fiscal plans and budgets, and supervises the Commonwealth's borrowing. See §§ 2141-2144, 2147. The Board also represents Puerto Rico in so-called Title III cases—judicial proceedings, modeled on federal bankruptcy proceedings, for restructuring the Commonwealth's (and its instrumentalities') debt. See §§ 2161-2177.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,28,"With one exception, PROMESA says nothing explicit about abrogating sovereign immunity. The exception is for Title III cases, and comes via the Federal Bankruptcy Code. PROMESA incorporates, as part of its mechanism for restructuring debt, the Code's express abrogation of sovereign immunity. See § 2161(a) (incorporating 11 U.S.C. § 106 for cases under Title III).

In particular, no provision states that it is abrogating any immunity the Board possesses from legal claims.",Kagan,0,

Most fundamentally, Section 2126(a), entitled Jurisdiction, states that any action against the Oversight Board, and any action otherwise arising out of PROMESA, shall be brought in the Federal District Court sitting in Puerto Rico.1 And Section 2126(c) anticipates that those actions may lead to orders granting declaratory or injunctive relief against the Oversight Board, under the provision, such orders cannot take effect until the litigation is over.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,30,"On the flipside, PROMESA sets certain limits on litigation targeting the Board. Section 2125 forecloses monetary liability against the Board, its members, and its employees for actions taken to carry out the statute. And Section 2126(e) provides that no district court will have jurisdiction over challenges to the Board's certification determinations—mainly, decisions approving Puerto Rico's fiscal plans and  budgets. See §§ 2141(e), 2142(e) (describing those determinations).",Kagan,0,
2022-031,31,"The suit before us demands that the Board release various documents relating to its work. Respondent Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, Inc. (CPI) is a nonprofit media organization that has published many reports on Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis and the debt-restructuring process. In 2016, CPI asked the Board to turn over a broad array of materials, including communications between the Board's members and Puerto Rican and U. S. officials. When the request went unanswered, CPI sued the Board in the Federal District Court in Puerto Rico. CPI cited a provision of the Puerto Rican Constitution interpreted to guarantee a right of access to public records. And it requested an injunction ordering the records' release.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,32,"The Board moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that, as an arm of the Puerto Rican government, it enjoys sovereign immunity. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that Congress had abrogated the Board's immunity in PROMESA—particularly, in Section 2126(a)'s jurisdictional provision. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a-76a. While the parties fought over unresolved privilege issues, CPI brought a second suit seeking another set of documents. The Board again invoked sovereign immunity, and the court again denied the defense. See id., at 56a-57a. Orders in both suits were consolidated for appeal.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,33,"The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the denial of immunity, over a dissent. See 35 F.4th 1 (2022). The court began by citing Circuit precedent that Puerto Rico (like a State or Indian tribe) enjoys sovereign immunity. It then assumed without deciding that the Board shares in Puerto Rico's immunity, noting that CPI had not contested that issue. Id., at 15. That was the Board's final piece of good news—for the court next held that PROMESA abrogates the Board's (assumed) immunity. Congress may abrogate sovereign immunity, the court noted, by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute. Ibid. (quoting Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000)). And Congress had done so, the court held, in Section 2126(a): The grant of jurisdiction there unequivocally stated Congress's intention that the Board could be sued in federal district court. 35 F.4th at 17. The court found additional support for its holding in Sections 2126(c) and (e). The former, the court reasoned, contemplates orders of declaratory and injunctive relief against the Board. Ibid. And the latter, in making certification challenges unreviewable, implies that all other claims against the Board fall within Section 2126(a)'s scope. Ibid. Judge Lynch disagreed. She would have held that Congress had not adequately set forth an intent to abrogate the Board's immunity, whether in Section 2126(a)'s jurisdictional grant or in any other provision. Id., at 21.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,34,"We granted certiorari, 598 U. S. ___, 143 S.Ct. 82, 214 L.Ed.2d 12 (2022), and now reverse.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,36,"The question on which we granted certiorari is whether PROMESA—and particularly its jurisdictional provision—abrogates the Board's immunity. See Brief for Oversight Board i. As thus framed, the question asks only about abrogation, while taking the Board's underlying immunity as a given. That framing accords with how this case played out in the courts below. Because Circuit precedent had settled Puerto Rico's own immunity, the lower courts barely addressed the question. See, e.g., 35 F.4th at 13-14. Similarly for the Board's immunity. CPI never argued that  the Commonwealth's immunity did not extend to the Board, and for that reason, the courts below simply assumed the Board's immunity before turning to the abrogation issue. See, e.g., id., at 14-15. We took the case on those terms, and we resolve it on those terms. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (We are a court of review, not of first view). That means we assume without deciding that Puerto Rico is immune from suit in federal district court, and that the Board partakes of that immunity. We address only whether, accepting those premises, PROMESA effects an abrogation.2",Kagan,0,
2022-031,37,"The standard for finding a congressional abrogation is stringent. Congress, this Court has often held, must make its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity unmistakably clear in the language of the statute. E.g., Kimel, 528 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 631 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 287, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011) (Where a statute is susceptible of multiple plausible interpretations, we will not read it to strip immunity). We have invoked that clear-statement rule, and applied it equivalently, in cases naming the federal government, States, and Indian tribes as defendants. See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290-291, 132 S.Ct. 1441, 182 L.Ed.2d 497 (2012), Kimel, 528 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 631, Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 790, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014).3 CPI argues that the rule should not likewise apply to Puerto Rico, citing Congress's plenary power over Territories. See Brief for CPI 25-26 (The concept of plenary power is incompatible with forcing Congress to express its intent unequivocally). But we have similarly described Congress's power over the tribes, and still demand that Congress unequivocally express an intent to abrogate their immunity. Bay Mills, 572 U.S. at 790, 134 S.Ct. 2024 (internal quotation marks omitted), see ibid. (Although Congress has plenary authority over tribes, courts will not lightly assume that Congress in fact intends to abrogate their immunity). Our precedent thus conveys a consistent message: If a defendant enjoys sovereign immunity (which we are assuming the Board does), abrogation requires an unequivocal declaration from Congress. Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 232, 109 S.Ct. 2397, 105 L.Ed.2d 181 (1989).",Kagan,0,
2022-031,38,"The Court has found that standard met in only two situations. The first is when a statute says in so many words that it is stripping immunity from a sovereign entity. Congress, for example, has provided that States shall not be immune, under any doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court for patent or copyright infringement. 35 U.S.C. § 296(a), 17 U.S.C. § 511(a). Those provisions, we have noted, could not have made any clearer Congress's intent to abrogate immunity. Allen v. Cooper, 589 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 994, 1001, 206 L.Ed.2d 291 (2020) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The second is when a statute creates a cause of action and authorizes suit against a government on that claim. Take the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) or the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). We held that each abrogated sovereign immunity by authorizing suits against employers—specifically including governments—for violating the statute's provisions (i.e., for discriminating or denying leave). See Kimel, 528 U.S. at 73-74, 120 S.Ct. 631, Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 726, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003). Or consider the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). We likewise saw an abrogation in its authorization of tribal suits against States for violating their statutory duty to negotiate about gaming compacts. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 56-57, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). True enough, none of those Acts expressly declared sovereigns non-immune (as the patent and copyright laws did). But all expressly authorized suits against sovereigns in service of enforcing statutory requirements. And recognizing immunity would have negated those authorizations: The very suits allowed against governments would automatically have been dismissed.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,39,"PROMESA fits neither of those two molds. Except in Title III debt-restructuring proceedings (not at issue here), the statute does not provide that the Board or Puerto Rico is subject to suit. See supra, at 1181. And indeed, the exception implies the opposite as a general rule. The immunity provision that PROMESA borrows from the Bankruptcy Code for Title III cases states: Sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit, including a Territory. 11 U.S.C. § 106(a), incorporated by 48 U.S.C. § 2161(a), 11 U.S.C. § 101(27). Congress chose not to adopt similar language to govern other kinds of litigation involving the Board. See, e.g., Badgerow v. Walters, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1310, 1318, 212 L.Ed.2d 355 (2022) (When Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, we generally take the choice to be deliberate). Too, PROMESA does not create any cause of action (or otherwise approve any claim) for use against the Board or Puerto Rico. So recognizing immunity under PROMESA would not—as in the ADEA, FMLA, and IGRA cases—authorize a suit against a sovereign with one hand, only to bar it with the other. Instead, immunity would operate in the ordinary way—to protect a sovereign from a host of claims Congress has not otherwise said may proceed. The upshot is evident: Congress has not, through a means we have recognized, made its intention to abrogate immunity unmistakably clear. Kimel, 528 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 631 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Kagan,0,
2022-031,40,"CPI contends we can still find a clear statement in PROMESA, based on the statute's establishment of a judicial review scheme. The primary provision in CPI's argument (as in the First Circuit's, see supra, at 1182) is Section 2126(a): Any  action against the Oversight Board, and any action otherwise arising out of PROMESA, shall be brought in the Federal District Court for Puerto Rico. In CPI's view, that provision—especially when combined with Section 2126(c)'s allusion to declaratory or injunctive relief against the Oversight Board—expresses Congress's clear intent to subject the Board to suit in federal court. Brief for CPI 16. CPI backs up that argument by pointing to provisions insulating the Board (and its members and employees) from monetary liability and barring suits challenging the Board's budgetary decisions. See id., at 15-16, 38-40, see supra, at 1181-1182. Those protections, CPI maintains, would have no point if the Board were immune generally. Brief for CPI 16. So taken together (says CPI), PROMESA's judicial review provisions are incompatible with sovereign immunity. Id., at 35.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,41,"But all those provisions serve a function without our reading an abrogation of immunity into PROMESA. In Sections 2126(a) and (c), Congress indeed contemplated the possibility of suits—and of relief—against the Board. And wisely so—because litigation against the Board can arise even though the Board enjoys sovereign immunity generally. For one thing, statutes other than PROMESA abrogate the Board's immunity from particular claims. See generally supra, at 1184. Consider Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, prohibiting various kinds of employment discrimination. That law, this Court has held, validly abrogates the immunity of governments and governmental agencies from all actions it authorizes. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(a)-(b), see Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 447-448, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976). So if a Board employee were fired because of race, Section 2126(a) would tell him where to bring his suit and Section 2126(c) would govern the timing of injunctive and declaratory relief. And for another thing, the Board could decide to waive its immunity from particular suits or claims. Were it to do so, Sections 2126(a) and (c) would again kick in. So PROMESA's judicial review scheme—absent a categorical abrogation of immunity—still has plenty of work to do. For similar reasons, this Court has held that other jurisdictional and judicial review provisions were insufficient to establish an abrogation. See Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 786, and n. 4, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991), Dellmuth, 491 U.S. at 231, 109 S.Ct. 2397. Here, as there, providing for a judicial forum does not make the requisite clear statement.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,42,"Nor do the litigation protections in PROMESA fill the gap. At the most basic level, it would be peculiar to read shields from lawsuits as unmistakably subjecting the Board to lawsuits (by abrogating immunity). But aside from that, CPI is wrong to think that those shields would be pointless or superfluous unless PROMESA generally abrogates the Board's immunity. Brief for CPI 38. Consider first Section 2125's protection of the Board, its employees, and its members from monetary liability for carrying out PROMESA. That provision would do work whenever, as discussed above, some other law abrogated or waived the Board's immunity from specific claims. In such a case, the claim could go forward, but Section 2125 would stop the award of money damages. Of particular note, that section would limit the Board's liability in Title III cases, in which PROMESA has indeed abrogated immunity. See supra, at 1181. And last, Section 2125 protects individuals—the Board's members and employees—not covered by the Board's sovereign immunity. All in all, that seems like more than enough to explain the provision's existence. Similarly for Section 2126(e), which  prevents challenges to the Board's fiscal and budgetary decisions. Yes, sovereign immunity insulates the Board itself from those attacks. But without Section 2126(e), a plaintiff might get around that immunity via an Ex parte Young action—a suit against an individual Board member for injunctive relief. See Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 254-255, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011) (describing the Ex parte Young limit on the sovereign-immunity principle). Section 2126(e) precludes that possibility. So it too has a role to play in a scheme with sovereign immunity.",Kagan,0,
2022-031,43,"In short, nothing in PROMESA makes Congress's intent to abrogate the Board's sovereign immunity unmistakably clear. Kimel, 528 U.S. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 631. The statute does not explicitly strip the Board of immunity. It does not expressly authorize the bringing of claims against the Board. And its judicial review provisions and liability protections are compatible with the Board's generally retaining sovereign immunity. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Kagan,0,

The Court today disagrees with only that latter conclusion, holding that nothing abrogates petitioner's immunity, but it assumes without deciding the logically antecedent question whether petitioner enjoys that immunity in the first place.

CPI responded (both in the District Court and on appeal) that Puerto Rico has no such immunity and that, even if it did, that immunity would be abrogated by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), 48 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq. Bound by Circuit precedent holding that Puerto Rico enjoys state sovereign immunity, each court below rejected CPI's first argument. See 35 F.4th 1, 14 (CA1 2022).

However, the plain text of the Eleventh Amendment applies only to lawsuits brought against a State by citizens of another State. And, because CPI is a resident of Puerto Rico, I can only assume that the Board and the First Circuit meant to refer to the sovereign immunity that is inherent in the 50 States. See Allen v.

At the Founding, the States considered themselves fully sovereign nations, and part of that sovereignty was their immunity from private suits. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1493 (internal quotation marks omitted). When advocating for the Constitution's ratification, leading Federalists then assured their opponents that the Constitution would not allow private citizens to hale States into federal court without their consent. See ibid. Though this Court held otherwise soon thereafter in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793), the Eleventh Amendment's swift ratification confirmed that Chisholm was wrong. See Hyatt, 587  U. S., at ___-___, 139 S.Ct., at 1495-1496. Thus, in general, the Constitution does not allow federal or state courts to hear cases against States without their consent.

Accordingly, it is difficult to see how the same inherent sovereign immunity that the States enjoy in federal court would apply to Puerto Rico. To be sure, the United States has urged us to hold that Puerto Rico enjoys a form of common-law immunity that, it claims, territorial governments can invoke in federal court. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16-19. But the Board has, at every stage, argued only that it possesses the same immunity as States. That argument appears untenable.

2022-032,30,"Halkbank is a bank whose shares are majority-owned by the Turkish Wealth Fund, which in turn is part of and owned by the Republic of Turkey. In 2019, the United States indicted Halkbank for a multi-year conspiracy to evade economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran. The indictment alleged that Halkbank, with the assistance of high-ranking Turkish government officials, laundered billions of dollars of Iranian oil and gas proceeds through the global financial system, including the U. S. financial system, in violation of U. S. sanctions and numerous federal statutes. The indictment further claimed that Halkbank made false statements to the U. S. Treasury Department in an effort to conceal the scheme. Two individual defendants, including a former Halkbank executive, have already been convicted in federal court for their roles in the alleged conspiracy. According to the U. S. Government, several other indicted defendants, including Halkbank's former general manager and its former head of foreign operations, remain at large.",Kavanaugh,0,

The Court of Appeals first determined that the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 3231. As to the FSIA, the Court of Appeals assumed without deciding that the FSIA confers immunity in criminal proceedings to foreign states and their instrumentalities, but held that in any event Halkbank's charged conduct fell within the FSIA's exception for commercial activities.",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-032,35,Halkbank first contends that the District Court lacks jurisdiction over this criminal prosecution.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,36,"Section 3231 of Title 18 provides: The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States. Via its sweeping language, § 3231 opens federal district courts to the full range of federal prosecutions for violations of federal criminal law. By its terms, § 3231 plainly encompasses Halkbank's alleged criminal offenses,  which were against the laws of the United States.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,37,"Halkbank cannot and does not dispute that § 3231's text as written encompasses the offenses charged in the indictment. Halkbank nonetheless argues that the statute implicitly excludes foreign states and their instrumentalities. In support of that argument, Halkbank identifies certain civil and bankruptcy statutes that expressly refer to actions against foreign states and their instrumentalities. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330(a), 1603(a)-(b), 11 U.S.C. §§ 101(27), 106(a), Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 137, § 1, 18 Stat. 470, as amended, § 3, 90 Stat. 2891. Because § 3231 refers generically to all federal criminal offenses without specifically mentioning foreign states or their instrumentalities, Halkbank reasons that foreign states and their instrumentalities do not fall within § 3231's scope.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,38,"We decline to graft an atextual limitation onto § 3231's broad jurisdictional grant over all offenses simply because several unrelated provisions in the U. S. Code happen to expressly reference foreign states and instrumentalities. Those scattered references in distinct contexts do not shrink the textual scope of § 3231, which operates without regard to the identity or status of the defendant. C. Keitner, Prosecuting Foreign States, 61 Va. J. Int'l L. 221, 242 (2021). Nor will we create a new clear-statement rule requiring Congress to clearly indicate its intent to include foreign states and their instrumentalities within § 3231's jurisdictional grant. Brief for Petitioner 11.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,39,"Halkbank also points to § 3231's predecessor: a provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 granting district courts cognizance of all crimes and offences that shall be cognizable under the authority of the United States. § 9, 1 Stat. 76. In Halkbank's view, other statutory provisions from that same era—including several that referred to suits against foreign actors—suggest that Congress would have expressly referenced foreign states and their instrumentalities if Congress had intended the 1789 provision to reach those entities. And Halkbank says that we should read § 3231 like its predecessor provision. The premise is unsupported. The 1789 provision, like § 3231 itself, contains no exception for prosecutions of foreign states or their instrumentalities. And this Court has never suggested that the 1789 provision contains an implicit exception. So the 1789 provision does not help Halkbank's argument that we should find an implicit exception in § 3231.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,40,"Finally, Halkbank invokes a separate provision of the 1789 Judiciary Act granting district courts jurisdiction over all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. § 9, id., at 77. Halkbank asserts that this Court has construed that provision not to confer jurisdiction over foreign state entities. Brief for Petitioner 22, 25 (citing Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812)). It follows, Halkbank says, that the 1789 Act's similar general reference to all crimes and offences and its successor § 3231's reference to all offenses likewise must be interpreted not to reach foreign states and their instrumentalities.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,41,"We disagree with Halkbank's reading of our precedents. The case on which Halkbank primarily relies, Schooner Exchange, indeed held that a district court lacked jurisdiction over a suit claiming ownership of a French warship docked in a Philadelphia port. 7 Cranch at 146-147. But Schooner Exchange did not address statutory subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, as this Court has since explained, Schooner Exchange concerned principles of foreign sovereign immunity that developed as a matter of common law. Samantar  v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 311, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 176 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2010). Contrary to Halkbank's contention, the common-law sovereign immunity recognized in Schooner Exchange is a rule of substantive law governing the exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts, not an exception to a general statutory grant of subject matter jurisdiction.

2022-032,46,"The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity originally developed in U. S. courts as a matter of common law rather than by statute. Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 311, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 176 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2010). In determining whether to allow suits against foreign sovereigns, however, courts traditionally deferred to the decisions of the political branches—in particular, those of the Executive Branch. Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983), see also Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.

2022-032,47,"In 1952, the State Department announced the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity, under which immunity was typically afforded in cases involving a foreign state's public acts, but not its strictly commercial acts. Rubin, 583 U. S., at ___-___, 138 S.Ct., at 821-822. In the ensuing years, the process by which the Executive Branch submitted statements regarding a foreign state's immunity sometimes led to inconsistency, particularly in light of the case-by-case diplomatic pressure that the Executive Branch received from foreign nations. Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 487, 103 S.Ct. 1962. And when foreign states did not ask the State Department to weigh in, courts were left to render immunity rulings on their own, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. Opati v.

2022-032,51,"Since the FSIA's enactment, this Court has repeatedly stated that the statute applies in civil actions. See, e.g., Cassirer v. Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Foundation, 596 U.

2022-032,52,"We now hold that the FSIA does not grant immunity to foreign states or their instrumentalities in criminal proceedings. Through the FSIA, Congress enacted a comprehensive scheme governing claims of immunity in civil actions against foreign states and their instrumentalities. That scheme does not cover criminal cases.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,54,"To begin with, the text of the FSIA indicates that the statute exclusively addresses civil suits against foreign states and their instrumentalities. The first provision of the FSIA grants district courts original jurisdiction over any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity. 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) (emphasis added), 90 Stat. 2891.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,55,"The FSIA then sets forth a carefully calibrated scheme that relates only to civil cases. For instance, the sole FSIA venue provision exclusively addresses venue in a civil action against a foreign state. § 1391(f). The Act similarly provides for removal to federal court of a civil action brought in state court. § 1441(d). The Act prescribes detailed rules—including those governing service of the summons and complaint, § 1608(a)(1), along with an answer or other responsive pleading to the complaint, § 1608(d), as well as for any judgment of default, § 1608(e)—that relate to civil cases alone. So, too, the Act's provision regarding counterclaims concerns only civil proceedings. § 1607. Finally, the Act renders a non-immune foreign state liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual, except that a foreign state (but not an agency or instrumentality thereof) shall not be liable for punitive damages. § 1606. Each of those terms characterizes civil, not criminal, litigation.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,56,"Other parts of the statute underscore the FSIA's exclusively civil focus. Congress codified its finding that authorizing federal courts to determine claims of foreign sovereign immunity would protect the rights of both foreign states and litigants in United States courts. § 1602 (emphasis added). The statutory term litigants does not ordinarily sweep in governments acting in a prosecutorial capacity. See Black's Law Dictionary 1119 (11th ed. 2019) (defining litigant as A party to a lawsuit, the plaintiff or defendant in a court action). What is more, Congress described the FSIA as defining the circumstances in which foreign states are immune from suit, not from criminal investigation or prosecution. 90 Stat. 2891 (emphasis added).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,57,"In stark contrast to those many provisions concerning civil actions, the FSIA is silent as to criminal matters. The Act says not a word about criminal proceedings against foreign states or their instrumentalities.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,58,"If Halkbank were correct that the FSIA immunizes foreign states and their instrumentalities from criminal prosecution, the subject undoubtedly would have surfaced somewhere in the Act's text. Congress typically does not hide elephants in mouseholes. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,59,"Context reinforces text. Although the vast majority of litigation involving foreign states and their instrumentalities at the time of the FSIA's enactment in 1976 was civil, the Executive Branch occasionally attempted to subject foreign-government-owned entities to federal criminal investigation. See In re Grand Jury Investigation of Shipping Industry, 186 F.Supp. 298, 318-320 (D.C. 1960), In re Investigation of World Arrangements, 13 F.R.D. 280, 288-291 (D.C. 1952). Given that history, it becomes even more unlikely that Congress sought to codify foreign sovereign immunity from criminal proceedings without saying a word about such proceedings.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,60,"Congress's determination about the FSIA's precise location within the U. S. Code bolsters that inference. Congress expressly decided to house each provision of the FSIA within Title 28, which mostly concerns civil procedure. See 90 Stat. 2891. But the FSIA did not alter Title 18, which addresses crimes and criminal procedure.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,61,"Finally, this Court's decision in Samantar supports the conclusion that the FSIA does not apply to criminal proceedings. In Samantar, we considered whether the FSIA's immunity provisions applied to a suit against an individual foreign official based on actions taken in his official capacity. 560 U.S. at 308, 130 S.Ct. 2278. Analyzing the Act's text, purpose, and history, the Court determined that the FSIA's comprehensive solution for suits against states does not extend to suits against individual officials. Id., at 323, 325, 130 S.Ct. 2278.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,62,"As in Samantar, we conclude here that the FSIA's provisions concerning suits against foreign states and their instrumentalities do not extend to a discrete context —in this case, criminal proceedings. The Act's careful calibration of jurisdiction, procedures, and remedies for civil litigation confirms that Congress did not cover criminal proceedings. Id., at 319, 130 S.Ct. 2278. Put simply, immunity in criminal proceedings was not the particular problem to which Congress was responding. Id., at 323, 130 S.Ct. 2278.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,64,"In response to all of that evidence of the FSIA's exclusively civil scope, Halkbank emphasizes a sentence of the FSIA codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1604: Subject to existing international agreements, a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607 of this chapter. Halkbank contends that § 1604 renders it immune not only from civil suits but also from criminal prosecutions.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,65,"In complete isolation, § 1604 might be amenable to that reading. But this Court has a duty to construe statutes, not isolated provisions. Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, 290, 130 S.Ct. 1396, 176 L.Ed.2d 225 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court must read the words Congress enacted in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme. Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989). When we consider § 1604 alongside its neighboring FSIA provisions, it becomes overwhelmingly evident  that § 1604 does not grant immunity to foreign states and their instrumentalities in criminal matters.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,66,"Section 1330(a) is the place to start. This Court has explained that Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem. Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). Indeed, the public law containing the FSIA begins with § 1330 and then later follows with § 1604. See 90 Stat. 2891-2892. Recall that § 1330(a) confers district-court jurisdiction over any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity. Section 1604 then confers immunity on foreign states unless an enumerated statutory exception applies. See §§ 1605-1607.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,67,"Reading the two provisions together (as we must) and sequentially (per Congress's design), the natural inference is that § 1604 operates exclusively in civil cases. Section 1330(a) spells out a universe of civil (and only civil) cases against foreign states over which district courts have jurisdiction, and § 1604 then clarifies how principles of immunity operate within that limited civil universe.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,68,"We thus decline to read § 1604's grant of immunity to apply in criminal proceedings —a category of cases beyond the civil actions contemplated in § 1330(a), the jurisdictional grant to which § 1604 is substantively and sequentially linked. Before making that leap, we would expect to find some express textual indication regarding § 1604's purportedly broader-than-civil scope. But none exists.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,69,"Moreover, Halkbank's interpretation of § 1604 is difficult to square with its interpretation of § 1605, an FSIA provision delineating exceptions to the immunity granted in § 1604. Halkbank reads § 1604 to confer immunity in both civil and criminal cases. But Halkbank then turns around and insists that the exceptions to that immunity specified in § 1605—exceptions which, per the statute, apply in any case—attach exclusively in civil matters. Brief for Petitioner 43.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,70,"In other words, Halkbank sees § 1330 as operating only in civil cases, § 1604 in both civil and criminal cases, and § 1605 only in civil cases. In Halkbank's view, the FSIA's scope awkwardly flip-flops from civil to civil-and-criminal back to civil again in sequential provisions. Congress did not write such a mangled statute. The better and more natural reading is that §§ 1330, 1604, and 1605 operate in tandem within a single universe of civil matters.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,71,"The FSIA's remaining provisions described above—namely, those detailing elaborate procedures and remedies applicable exclusively in civil cases—strongly buttress the conclusion that § 1604 lays down a baseline principle of foreign sovereign immunity from civil actions, and from civil actions alone. Cassirer, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1508 (emphasis added). Considering the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest we should read § 1604 to apply to criminal proceedings. Samantar, 560 U.S. at 319, 130 S.Ct. 2278.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,72,"In sum, Halkbank's narrow focus on § 1604 misses the forest for the trees (and a single tree at that). Halkbank's § 1604 argument reduces to the implausible contention that Congress enacted a statute focused entirely on civil actions and then in one provision that does not mention criminal proceedings somehow stripped the Executive Branch of all power to bring domestic criminal prosecutions against instrumentalities of foreign states. On Halkbank's view, a purely commercial business that is directly and majority-owned by a foreign state could engage in criminal conduct  affecting U. S. citizens and threatening U. S. national security while facing no criminal accountability at all in U. S. courts. Nothing in the FSIA supports that result.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,74,Halkbank advances three additional reasons why this Court should read the FSIA to immunize foreign states and their instrumentalities from criminal proceedings. None is persuasive.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,75,"First, Halkbank emphasizes this Court's statement in a 1989 case that the FSIA is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court. Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 439, 109 S.Ct. 683. But Amerada Hess was not a criminal case. Rather, it was a civil case brought under the Alien Tort Statute and under the federal courts' general admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Id., at 432, 109 S.Ct. 683 (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1333, 1350). This Court has often admonished that general language in judicial opinions should be read as referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances then before the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances that the Court was not then considering. Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419, 424, 124 S.Ct. 885, 157 L.Ed.2d 843 (2004). Amerada Hess made clear that the FSIA displaces general grants of subject-matter jurisdiction in Title 28—that is, in civil cases against foreign states. 488 U.S. at 437, 109 S.Ct. 683 (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1333, 1335, 1337, 1338). The Court had no occasion to consider the FSIA's implications for Title 18's grant of criminal jurisdiction over all federal criminal offenses. 18 U.S.C. § 3231.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,76,"At any rate, Amerada Hess's rationale does not translate to the criminal context. The Court's holding as to the nonapplicability of general civil jurisdictional grants was based on the FSIA's own civil jurisdictional grant and the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme as to civil matters. 488 U.S. at 434-435, and n. 3, 437, 109 S.Ct. 683 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a)). But the FSIA contains no grant of criminal jurisdiction and says nothing about criminal matters—a distinct legal regime housed in an entirely separate title of the U. S. Code. The FSIA did not implicitly repeal or modify 18 U.S.C. § 3231's core grant of criminal jurisdiction.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,77,"Second, Halkbank warns that courts and the Executive will lack congressional guidance as to procedure in criminal cases if we conclude that the FSIA does not apply in the criminal context. Brief for Petitioner 37. But that concern carried no weight in Samantar, which likewise deemed the FSIA's various procedures inapplicable to a specific category of cases— there, suits against foreign officials. In any event, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure would govern any federal criminal proceedings. And although Halkbank argues that Congress would not have been indifferent to criminal jury trials involving instrumentalities of foreign states, id., at 38, juries already resolve similarly sensitive cases against foreign officials after Samantar.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,78,"Third, Halkbank briefly raises a consequentialist argument. According to Halkbank, if the FSIA does not apply to criminal proceedings, then state prosecutors would also be free to commence criminal proceedings against foreign states and their instrumentalities. Halkbank argues that those state prosecutions would raise foreign policy concerns. But we must interpret the FSIA as written. And the statute simply does not grant immunity to foreign states and their instrumentalities in criminal matters.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,79,"In addition, it is not evident that the premise of Halkbank's consequentialist argument  is correct. To begin with, Halkbank offers no history of state prosecutors subjecting foreign states or their instrumentalities to criminal jurisdiction. And if such a state prosecution were brought, the United States could file a suggestion of immunity. A decision by a state court to deny foreign sovereign immunity might be reviewable by this Court (a question we do not here address). Moreover, state criminal proceedings involving foreign states or their instrumentalities might be preempted under principles of foreign affairs preemption (another question we do not here address). Cf. American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 123 S.Ct. 2374, 156 L.Ed.2d 376 (2003). And if those principles do not apply or do not suffice to protect U. S. national security and foreign policy interests, Congress and the President may always respond by enacting additional legislation.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,80,"In short, Halkbank's various FSIA arguments are infused with the notion that U. S. criminal proceedings against instrumentalities of foreign states would negatively affect U. S. national security and foreign policy. But it is not our role to rewrite the FSIA based on purported policy concerns that Congress and the President have not seen fit to recognize. The FSIA does not provide foreign states and their instrumentalities with immunity from criminal proceedings.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,82,"Although the FSIA does not immunize Halkbank from criminal prosecution, Halkbank advances one other plea for immunity. In the context of a civil proceeding, this Court has recognized that a suit not governed by the FSIA may still be barred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common law. Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 324, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 176 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2010). Halkbank maintains that principles of common-law immunity preclude this criminal prosecution even if the FSIA does not. To that end, Halkbank contends that common-law-immunity principles operate differently in criminal cases than in civil cases. See Brief for Petitioner 34-35, 44. And Halkbank argues that the Executive Branch cannot unilaterally abrogate common-law immunity by initiating prosecution. Id., at 44.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-032,83,"The Government disagrees. Reasoning from pre-FSIA history and precedent, the Government asserts that the common law does not provide for foreign sovereign immunity when, as here, the Executive Branch has commenced a federal criminal prosecution of a commercial entity like Halkbank. See Brief for United States 21. In the alternative, the Government contends that any common-law immunity in criminal cases would not extend to commercial activities such as those undertaken by Halkbank. Id., at 16-21.",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-032,88,"For almost a half century, judges have known where to turn for guidance when deciding whether a foreign sovereign is susceptible to suit in an American court: Congress's directions in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq. Sometimes the FSIA authorizes American courts to hear cases against foreign sovereigns, sometimes the statute immunizes foreign sovereigns from suit. Today, however, the Court holds that the FSIA's rules apply only in civil cases. To decide whether a foreign sovereign is susceptible to criminal prosecution, the Court says, federal judges must consult the common law. Respectfully, I disagree. The same statute we routinely use to analyze sovereign immunity in civil cases applies equally in criminal ones.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,90,"I begin from common ground. Congress has vested federal courts with subject-matter jurisdiction over cases involving offenses against the laws of the United States. 18 U.S.C. § 3231. The Court holds that this statute permits federal courts to hear cases alleging offenses committed by foreign sovereigns. I agree. As the Court explains, § 3231's language grants subject-matter jurisdiction in broad terms without regard to the nature of the defendant, nor are we free to graft an atextual limitation onto the law that would exempt foreign sovereigns from its reach. Ante, at 944-945. Of course, Türkiye Halk Bankasi (Halkbank) asserts that it is a sovereign entity and, as such, enjoys immunity from prosecution. But that does not change a thing. Generally, questions about sovereign immunity do not go to a court's subject-matter jurisdiction (something a court must consider in every case even if the parties do not). Instead, questions of sovereign immunity usually go to a court's personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant. And as with other personal-jurisdiction defenses, a sovereign may waive its immunity and consent to judicial proceedings if it wishes. See PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2244, 2264, 210 L.Ed.2d 624 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,91,"From that common ground, however, I part ways with the Court. Like the Second Circuit, I would analyze Halkbank's assertion of sovereign immunity under the terms of the FSIA. Start with 28 U.S.C. § 1604, which sets forth the FSIA's general immunity rule. It provides in relevant part that a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607 of this chapter. Elsewhere, the statute defines a foreign state to include an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. § 1603(a). And the statute defines an agency or instrumentality to include any separate legal person, such as a corporation, that is an organ or subdivision of a foreign state and majority owned by a foreign state. § 1603(b)(1)-(2).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,92,"Applying those rules here yields a ready answer. Halkbank is a corporation that is majority-owned by the government of Turkey. 16 F.4th 336, 349 (C.A.2 2021). Accordingly, it qualifies as a foreign state entitled to immunity from suit under § 1604 unless one of the exceptions provided in §§ 1605-1607 applies. And, it turns out, one such exception does apply. Section  1605(a)(2) instructs that a foreign sovereign is not entitled to immunity when the action is based upon certain commercial activity in or affecting the United States. In this case, the indictment sufficiently alleges that Halkbank has engaged in just those kinds of commercial activities. See No. 15 Cr. 867 (SDNY, Oct. 1, 2020), App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-38a. Of course, this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss the indictment, and the question of immunity may be revisited as the case proceeds. But for now, nothing in the law precludes this suit, just as the Second Circuit held.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,93,"That the FSIA tells us all we need to know to resolve the sovereign immunity question in this case can come as no surprise. This Court has long acknowledged that the FSIA must be applied by the district courts in every action against a foreign sovereign. Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 493, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983). As we have put it, any sort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in an American court must stand on the Act's text. Or it must fall. Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd., 573 U.S. 134, 141-142, 134 S.Ct. 2250, 189 L.Ed.2d 234 (2014). It's a rule that follows directly from the statutory text because Congress established in the FSIA a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity. Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, 699, 124 S.Ct. 2240, 159 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,95,"Despite all this, the Court declines to apply the FSIA's directions governing foreign sovereign immunity. It holds that the statute's general immunity rule in § 1604 speaks only to civil disputes. Any question about a foreign sovereign's immunity from criminal prosecution, the Court insists, must therefore be resolved under common-law principles. Ante, at 947, 951. In aid of its conclusion, the Court offers three principal arguments. But to my mind, none packs the punch necessary to displace the plain statutory text.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,96,"First, the Court points to 28 U.S.C. § 1330. That provision grants federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over civil cases against foreign sovereigns when one of the exceptions provided in §§ 1605-1607 applies. From this grant of civil jurisdiction, the Court reasons, it is a natural inference that § 1604's immunity rule must apply only in civil cases. Ante, at 949. More naturally, however, it seems to me that any inference from § 1330 runs the other way. Section 1330 shows that when Congress wanted to limit its attention to civil suits, it knew how to do so. Section 1604 contains no similar language restricting its scope to civil disputes. Instead, it speaks far more broadly, holding that a foreign state shall be immune unless a statutorily specified exception applies. Normally, when Congress includes limiting language in one section of a law but excludes it from another, we understand the difference in language to convey a difference in meaning (expressio unius est exclusio alterius). See, e.g., Bittner v. United States, 598 U. S. 85, 94, 143 S.Ct. 713, 215 L.Ed.2d 1 (2023), Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 391, 135 S.Ct. 913, 190 L.Ed.2d 771 (2015). The Court's interpretation of the FSIA defies this traditional rule of statutory construction. Today, the Court does to § 1604 exactly what it recognizes we may not do to § 3231—grafting an atextual limitation onto the law's unambiguous terms (in this instance, adding a civil-only restriction).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,97,"Second, the Court suggests we should read § 1604 as affording immunity only in civil cases because § 1605's exceptions apply only in civil cases. Ante, at 949. But  here both the premise and the conclusion seem to me mistaken. If some of § 1605's exceptions apply only in civil cases, others speak more expansively. Take the exception relevant here. The commercial-activities exception found in § 1605(a)(2) denies sovereign immunity in any case  in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state. (Emphasis added). Nowhere does this exception distinguish between civil and criminal actions. Besides, even if the Court's premise were correct and § 1605's exceptions (somehow) applied only in civil actions, what would that prove? It might simply mean that Congress wanted a more generous immunity from criminal proceedings than civil suits.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,98,"Finally, the Court points to the FSIA's provisions regulating the venue and removal of civil actions against foreign sovereigns. Ante, at 947-948 (discussing §§ 1391(f) and 1441(d)). But once more, it seems to me this shows only that Congress knew how to speak specifically to civil suits when it wished to do so. Congress may have had reason to be especially concerned about the venue for civil suits too, given that almost all efforts to hale foreign sovereigns into U. S. courts have involved civil claims. Indeed, the parties and their amici struggled to find examples of criminal charges brought against foreign sovereigns either before or after the FSIA's adoption —not only in the United States, but in any country. Compare Brief for United States 25-26 with Reply Brief 7-9. I might be willing to spot the Court that the venue and removal provisions could help illuminate § 1604's scope if that statute were ambiguous. But no one suggests that we have anything like that here. Section 1604 is as clear as a bell and we must abide by its direction that foreign sovereigns shall be immune absent some express statutory exception.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,100,"After declaring that the FSIA applies only to civil suits, the Court holds that the common law controls the disposition of any claim of foreign sovereign immunity in criminal cases. Ante, at 951. Yet rather than decide whether the common law shields Halkbank from this suit, the Court shunts the case back to the Second Circuit to figure that out. All of which leaves litigants and our lower court colleagues with an unenviable task, both in this case and others sure to emerge. Many thorny questions lie down the common law path and the Court fails to supply guidance on how to resolve any of them.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,101,"Right out of the gate, lower courts will have to decide between two very different approaches. One option is to defer to the Executive Branch's judgment on whether to grant immunity to a foreign sovereign— an approach sometimes employed by federal courts in the years immediately preceding the FSIA's adoption. The other option is for a court to make the immunity decision looking to customary international law and other sources. Compare Brief for United States 21-26 with Brief for Professor Ingrid (Wuerth) Brunk et al. as Amici Curiae 6-25.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,102,"Whichever path a court chooses, more questions will follow. The first option— deferring to the Executive—would seem to sound in separation-of-powers concerns. But does this mean that courts should not be involved in making immunity determinations at all? And what about the fact that the strong deference cases didn't appear until the 20th century, were courts acting unconstitutionally before then? If not, should we be concerned that deference to the Executive's immunity decisions risks relegating courts to the status of potted plants, inconsistent with their duty to say what the law is in the cases that  come before them? See, e.g., Brief for Professor Ingrid (Wuerth) Brunk et al. as Amici Curiae 17-21.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-032,103,"The second option—applying customary international law—comes with its own puzzles. If the briefing before us proves anything, it is that customary international law supplies no easy answer to the question whether a foreign sovereign enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution. Compare Brief for Professor Roger O'Keefe as Amicus Curiae 11-16 with Brief for Mark B. Feldman et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Nor is it even altogether clear on what authority federal courts might develop and apply customary international law. Article VI of the Constitution does not list customary international law as federal law when it enumerates sources of the supreme Law of the Land. And Article I vests Congress rather than the Judiciary with the power to define and punish  Offences against the Law of Nations. § 8, cl. 10. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 739-742, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.

2022-032,104,"Perhaps Article III incorporated customary international law into federal common law. But since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), federal courts have largely disclaimed the power to develop federal common law outside of a few reserved areas. See Sosa, 542 U.S. at 740-742, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (opinion of Scalia, J.). And whether customary international law survives as a form of federal common law after Erie is a matter of considerable debate among scholars. Compare C. Bradley & J. Goldsmith, Customary International Law as Federal Common Law: A Critique of the Modern Position, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 815 (1997), with H. Koh, Is International Law Really State Law?, 111 Harv. L.

The Government had not raised exhaustion, but the Court of Appeals did so sua sponte because it characterized § 1252(d)(1) as establishing a jurisdictional requirement.

By contrast, nonjurisdictional rules govern how courts and litigants operate within those bounds.

2022-033,45,"Two aspects of § 1252(d)(1), taken together, persuade us that this statutory provision lacks the clear statement necessary to qualify as jurisdictional.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,46,"First, § 1252(d)(1) imposes an exhaustion requirement, which is a quintessential claim-processing rule. When faced with a type of statutory requirement that ordinarily is not jurisdictional, we naturally expect the ordinary case, not an exceptional one. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. 145, 154-155, 133 S.Ct. 817, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013), see also, e.g., United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 410, 135 S.Ct. 1625, 191 L.Ed.2d 533 (2015). So it is here. We routinely treat as nonjurisdictional  threshold requirements that claimants must complete, or exhaust, before filing a lawsuit. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 166, and n. 6, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 176 L.Ed.2d 18 (2010).4 Indeed, we have  yet to hold that any statutory exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional when applying the clear-statement rule that we adopted in Arbaugh.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,47,"Exhaustion is typically nonjurisdictional for good reason. Jurisdictional treatment of an exhaustion requirement could undo the benefits of exhaustion. That is, exhaustion promotes efficiency, including by encouraging parties to resolve their disputes without litigation. See Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 219, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145, 112 S.Ct. 1081, 117 L.Ed.2d 291 (1992). But jurisdictional treatment can result in the opposite: If exhaustion is jurisdictional, litigants must slog through preliminary nonjudicial proceedings even when, for example, no party demands it or a court finds it would be pointless, wasteful, or too slow. Similarly, an exhaustion objection raised late in litigation (as jurisdictional objections can be) might derail many months of work on the part of the attorneys and the court. Henderson, 562 U.S. at 434-435, 131 S.Ct. 1197 (jurisdictional rules risk the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants). Thus, jurisdictional treatment could disserve the very interest in efficiency that exhaustion ordinarily advances. See Wilkins, 598 U. S., at 158, 143 S.Ct. 870 (Given the risk of disruption and waste that accompanies the jurisdictional label, courts will not lightly apply it to procedures Congress enacted to keep things running smoothly and efficiently).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,48,"It would therefore be aberrant for the exhaustion requirement in § 1252(d)(1) to be characterized as jurisdictional. Of course, Congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to a requirement that usually exists as a claim-processing rule. Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197. But to be confident Congress took that unexpected tack, we would need unmistakable evidence, on par with express language addressing the court's jurisdiction. Nothing close appears here.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,49,"Instead, a second feature of the statute compounds our doubt that § 1252(d)(1) qualifies as a jurisdictional rule: That provision's language differs substantially from more clearly jurisdictional language in related statutory provisions. Elsewhere in the laws governing immigration cases, Congress specified that no court shall have jurisdiction to review certain matters.5 Over and over again, Congress used that language in provisions that were enacted at the same time—and even in the same section—as § 1252(d)(1).6 But Congress eschewed such plainly jurisdictional language in § 1252(d)(1).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,50,"The contrast between the text of § 1252(d)(1) and the unambiguous jurisdictional terms in related provisions shows that Congress would have spoken  in clearer terms if it intended for § 1252(d)(1) to have similar jurisdictional force. Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 143, 132 S.Ct. 641, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012), accord, Henderson, 562 U.S. at 438-439, 131 S.Ct. 1197. And, here, there is good reason to infer that the linguistic contrast between § 1252(d)(1) and neighboring provisions is meaningful, not haphazard: Unlike other provisions, § 1252(d)(1) concerns exhaustion, and its language tracks exhaustion's usual nonjurisdictional status.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,51,"Taken together, these two features of § 1252(d)(1)—its content as an exhaustion requirement and its contrast with related, plainly jurisdictional provisions—make interpreting § 1252(d)(1) as a claim-processing rule credible enough that we cannot deem it clearly jurisdictional. Thus, we conclude that § 1252(d)(1) is a non-jurisdictional rule `merely prescribing the method by which the jurisdiction granted the courts by Congress is to be exercised.' Kontrick, 540 U.S. at 454, 124 S.Ct. 906 (quoting 12 C. Wright, A. Miller, & R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3141, p. 485 (2d ed. 1997)).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,53,"The Government offers several reasons why § 1252(d)(1) should nonetheless be characterized as jurisdictional. Given our clear-statement rule, none is persuasive.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,54,"First, the Government insists that § 1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional because it is addressed to the court and limits review. But that language does not necessarily refer to the court's jurisdiction. Claim-processing rules can also be addressed to courts. After all, one purpose of such rules is to instruct the court on the limits of its discretion in handling claims. Kontrick, 540 U.S. at 456, 124 S.Ct. 906. Provisions limiting review can be directions about the mode or manner of review that are likewise nonjurisdictional in nature. Examples abound, including elsewhere in the same title and section as § 1252(d)(1). See, e.g., § 1252(b)(2) (The court of appeals shall review the proceeding on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs), § 1535(a)(3) (The Court of Appeals shall  review questions of law de novo), 5 U.S.C. § 706 (The court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,55,"Moreover, when taking other aspects of the statute into account, it becomes apparent that § 1252(d)(1) is not using court and review in a jurisdictional manner. Section 1252(d)(1) is not even focused solely on the court. It also requires that the alien has exhausted certain remedies, § 1252(d)(1) (emphasis added), so it speaks to a party's procedural obligations as well, just like a nonjurisdictional claim-processing rule, Fort Bend County, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1851 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, as previously mentioned, Congress had expressly jurisdictional language close at hand. Supra, at 1113-1114. Its use of more ambiguous phrasing to impose a quintessential non-jurisdictional requirement is hardly the requisite clear statement that § 1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,56,"Second, the Government seeks to advance a theory that is based on a prior version of § 1252(d)(1)'s exhaustion requirement. A statute that existed before § 1252(d)(1) provided that an order of deportation  shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him. 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c) (1958 ed., Supp. III). According to the Government, that predecessor provision was jurisdictional, and Congress merely carried forward that understanding in § 1252(d)(1). But at each  step of that theory, we find doubt, not clarity.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,57,"To begin, the Government has not established that the predecessor provision was actually jurisdictional. Its text, standing alone, did not clearly govern the court's jurisdiction. So the Government turns to precedent. No precedent of this Court, however, established that the predecessor exhaustion provision was jurisdictional (in the sense that we now use the term).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,58,"The Government principally invokes Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995), and Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009). Both cases described portions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that contained § 1252(d)(1)'s predecessor as jurisdictional. Stone, 514 U.S. at 399, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, Nken, 556 U.S. at 424, 129 S.Ct. 1749. But jurisdiction, the Court has observed, is a word of many, too many, meanings, and courts have more than occasionally used it to describe rules beyond those governing a court's adjudicatory authority. Fort Bend County, 587 U. S., at ___-___, and n. 4, 139 S.Ct. at 1848-1849, and n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,59,"Neither Stone nor Nken attends to the distinction between jurisdictional rules (as we understand them today) and nonjurisdictional but mandatory ones. Indeed, Stone predates our cases, starting principally with Arbaugh in 2006, that bring some discipline to the use of the term jurisdictional. Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197. Nken came later, but it never addressed the Arbaugh line of cases. And in both Stone and Nken, whether the provisions were jurisdictional was not central to the case. Reed Elsevier, 559 U.S. at 161, 130 S.Ct. 1237. On top of all that, neither case addressed the exhaustion requirement specifically. Instead, both merely mentioned the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that housed the exhaustion requirement. Stone, 514 U.S. at 399, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, Nken, 556 U.S. at 424, 129 S.Ct. 1749. Stone and Nken therefore cannot be read to establish the predecessor exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,60,"The Government also points to pre-Arbaugh decisions by lower courts characterizing the predecessor exhaustion provision as jurisdictional. Brief for Respondent 21, n. 6 (collecting cases). We have held, however, that pre-Arbaugh lower court cases interpreting a related provision are not enough to make clear that a rule is jurisdictional. MOAC Mall Holdings LLC v. Transform Holdco LLC, 598 U. S. ___ ___, 143 S.Ct. 927, 939-940, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023), Wilkins, 598 U. S., at 165, 143 S.Ct. 870, Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1499-1500, Reed Elsevier, 559 U.S., at 167-169, 130 S.Ct. 1237.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,61,"Further weakening the Government's reliance on the claimed jurisdictional status of § 1252(d)(1)'s predecessor is the fact that when it enacted § 1252(d)(1), Congress did not even recodify that prior provision exactly. Instead, Congress altered the formulation that, according to the Government, had been understood as a jurisdictional rule. Compare 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c) (1958 ed., Supp. III) (a deportation order shall not be reviewed by any court if) with 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (a court may review a final order of removal only if). And having gone to the trouble of rewriting the provision, Congress still chose not to use the more expressly jurisdictional formulation that it utilized elsewhere. Supra, at 1113-1114. All of this is inconsistent with the Government's theory that Congress understood the predecessor provision to be jurisdictional and carried that forward in § 1252(d)(1).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,62,"Finally, the Government suggests that § 1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional simply because it falls within § 1252. Section 1252 is the exclusive source of jurisdiction for immigration cases like this one, the Government contends, so each of § 1252's limits must be jurisdictional. Brief for Respondent 17-18.7 This logical leap falls short. Any foreclosure of sources of jurisdiction outside § 1252 does not tell us which provisions within § 1252 are essential jurisdictional prerequisites. And even if some provisions in a statutory section qualify as jurisdictional, that does not suffice to establish that all others are. Sebelius, 568 U.S. at 155, 133 S.Ct. 817, Gonzalez, 565 U.S. at 146-147, 132 S.Ct. 641. This argument, like the Government's others, fails to demonstrate that it is clear that Congress made § 1252(d)(1)'s exhaustion requirement jurisdictional. Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 515, 126 S.Ct. 1235.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-033,63,"Because § 1252(d)(1)'s exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, it is subject to waiver and forfeiture. See Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert, 586 U. S. ___, ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 710, 714-715, 203 L.Ed.2d 43 (2019). The Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,65,"The Government now suggests that even if § 1252(d)(1) is not jurisdictional, the Court of Appeals' sua sponte requirement that Santos-Zacaria comply with § 1252(d)(1) can be justified on alternative grounds. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 7. We do not reach that issue. Instead, we hold that, even if § 1252(d)(1) were applied here, Santos-Zacaria has done enough to satisfy it. That is, § 1252(d)(1) does not require that Santos-Zacaria seek reconsideration from the Board, as the Court of Appeals believed.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,67,"Under the plain language of § 1252(d)(1), a noncitizen must exhaust all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right. The parties here dispute whether, to fulfill this requirement, Santos-Zacaria had to seek a certain form of review of her legal claim: reconsideration by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Whether exhaustion for § 1252(d)(1) purposes requires seeking Board reconsideration turns on the meaning of remedies available  as of right, which, in turn, relates to the specifics of the Board's reconsideration process.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,68,"Pursuant to that process, after the Board renders a final decision, it can provide additional review via reconsideration and its close cousin, reopening. Reconsideration addresses errors of law or fact in the previous order, while reopening accounts for new facts. §§ 1229a(c)(6)-(7), see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (2022).8",Jackson,0,
2022-033,69,"Meanwhile, it is well established that a remedy is not available as of right if it is discretionary. As of right is  a familiar phrase in the law, meaning by virtue of a legal entitlement. Black's Law Dictionary 141 (11th ed. 2019). And in the context relevant here—review of a legal claim—the phrase means review that is guaranteed, not contingent on permission or discretion. An appeal as of right is one over which the court has no discretion to deny review. Id., at 121. By contrast, discretionary review is review that is not a matter of right and instead requires permission. Id., at 1579. Under the Federal Rules, for instance, an appeal as of right, Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, stands in contrast to an appeal within the court's discretion, Fed. Rule App. Proc. 5. To take another example, this Court's certiorari review is not a matter of right, but of judicial discretion. Supreme Court Rule 10. Thus, because § 1252(d)(1) requires exhausting only remedies available as of right, it does not require exhausting discretionary review.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,70,"Board reconsideration and reopening are discretionary. By regulation, today and at the time of § 1252(d)(1)'s enactment, the decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (2022), 8 C.F.R. § 3.2 (1996), 61 Fed. Reg. 18904 (1996), see Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 12-13, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008) (tracing history of discretion to reopen back to 1916). That means a noncitizen can request reconsideration. But only if the motion to reconsider is granted does the Board proceed to make the decision upon such reconsideration as to whether to affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(i). And, again, whether to grant the motion to reconsider, and thus proceed to such review, is up to the Board in its discretion. § 1003.2(a), In re O-S-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006) (We have authority to deny a motion to reconsider as a matter of discretion), cf. § 1003.2(a) (The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,71,"Because Board reconsideration (like reopening) is a discretionary form of review, it is not available to the noncitizen as of right. Section 1252(d)(1) therefore does not require a noncitizen to pursue it.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,73,"The Government acknowledges that because § 1252(d)(1) requires only exhaustion of remedies available  as of right, a noncitizen need not exhaust `discretionary' remedies. Brief for Respondent 39. It also acknowledges that Board reconsideration is discretionary. Id., at 41, n. 11, Brief in Opposition 15-16. Still, the Government tries to squeeze reconsideration into the statutory requirement of remedies available as of right. We are unpersuaded.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,74,"According to the Government, § 1252(d)(1) requires seeking reconsideration because a noncitizen has the right to file a motion to reconsider. But that is a peculiar understanding of a remedy available as of right. The Government identifies no other provision that uses as of right to describe the right to file a motion that appeals to the decisionmaker's discretion. Tr. of Oral Arg. 35. A discretionary appeal, for example, is not as of right just because a litigant has a right to file a petition for permission to appeal. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(f).",Jackson,0,
2022-033,75,"That understanding of as of right is so unnatural that even the Government does not fully embrace it, as its view of other forms of relief reveals. Cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, and adjustment of status are discretionary types of immigration relief available to  noncitizens only as a matter of grace, not entitlement. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b, 1229c, 1255, see Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 247-248, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). And the Government accordingly volunteers them as examples of remedies not `available' to a noncitizen `as of right.' Brief for Respondent 39 (quoting § 1252(d)(1)). Yet eligible noncitizens can file requests for those forms of relief. See §§ 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.20, 1240.26, 1245.1. Even the Government does not say these are remedies available as of right just because noncitizens have a right to request them.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,76,"The Government's reading has a further flaw. Understanding the motion for reconsideration as a remedy available  as of right does not just read as of right unnaturally, it reads it out of § 1252(d)(1) altogether. Under the Government's view, there is a remedy that is available  as of right here because the noncitizen is entitled to request reconsideration by filing a motion. See Brief for Respondent 38-39. But if a noncitizen could not request reconsideration, there would be no remedy available for the noncitizen to exhaust. The statute's additional requirement that the remedy be available as of right would be entirely superfluous. Instead, we read the phrase as of right to do its usual work in the context of review of a legal claim: distinguishing between discretionary and nondiscretionary review.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,77,"Switching gears, the Government suggests that § 1252(d)(1) excludes only remedies made discretionary by statute, while reconsideration and reopening are made discretionary by regulation. Id. at 39-40. True, Congress elsewhere focused on discretion specified by statute. We considered such a provision in Kucana v. Holder, addressing administrative actions `the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.' 558 U.S. at 237, 130 S.Ct. 827 (quoting § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)). But § 1252(d)(1) draws no such line. It simply covers remedies that are available as of right. Whether that characteristic is established by statute or regulation makes no difference.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,78,"It is especially implausible that § 1252(d)(1) treats reconsideration and reopening as available  as of right just because the discretion whether to grant them is not specified by statute. As we noted previously, when Congress enacted § 1252(d)(1), regulation and historical practice had already firmly established Board reconsideration and reopening as discretionary. Supra, at 1117, 8 C.F.R. § 3.2 (1996), Dada, 554 U.S. at 12-13, 128 S.Ct. 2307. We have no reason to think § 1252(d)(1) categorizes those well-understood discretionary forms of review as available  as of right.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,79,"The Government also posits that reconsideration and reopening are available  as of right because in certain cases, denying the noncitizen's motion would be reversible as an abuse of discretion. See Brief for Respondent 41, n. 11, Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. All this shows is that the agency's discretion has limits. That is no surprise. Traditionally,  decisions on matters of discretion are reviewable for abuse of discretion. Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., 572 U.S. 559, 563, 134 S.Ct. 1744, 188 L.Ed.2d 829 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). They remain matters of discretion all the same.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,80,"Finally, not only do the Government's theories fail on their own terms, but they also share a common problem: They would render the statutory scheme incoherent. The Government urges that reconsideration (or at least a motion to reconsider) is an administrative remedy  available  as of right, § 1252(d)(1). Yet § 1252(d)(1) requires exhausting all such remedies, without exception. So if the Government is correct, noncitizens would need to seek reconsideration from the Board before obtaining judicial review in every case. But that obligation is incompatible with the rest of the statute's design.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,81,"In particular, elsewhere, the statute provides for a process that does not require reconsideration before judicial review. Noncitizens are authorized to seek judicial review of an agency order and, additionally, to seek administrative review of the agency's decision via a motion to reopen or reconsider the order. See § 1252(b)(6). The statute gives noncitizens the same 30-day window from the agency order to seek judicial review and administrative reconsideration. §§ 1252(b)(1), 1229a(c)(6)(B). The statute is thus designed around pursuing judicial review and agency reconsideration in parallel, not waiting to seek judicial review until after reconsideration is complete. With respect to a prior version of this scheme, we observed that, if a noncitizen seeks reconsideration, the statute plainly contemplates that two separate petitions for judicial review will exist in the normal course: one from the agency's initial order and a later one from its decision on the reconsideration motion. Stone, 514 U.S. at 393-395, 115 S.Ct. 1537.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,82,"If reconsideration were required for exhaustion, however, only one petition—the later one—would pass muster. The first petition would be premature. So the Government's interpretation of remedies available  as of right would not just flood the Board with reconsideration motions that noncitizens otherwise would not file, it would also flood the courts with pointless premature petitions—petitions that the statutory scheme would provide for noncitizens to file, on the one hand, yet deem unexhausted, on the other. We decline to interpret the statute to be so at war with itself.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,84,"Conceding that it would be inconsistent with the design of the statute to require noncitizens to always file a motion to reconsider for exhaustion purposes, the Government instead would require such a motion only sometimes: when the noncitizen is raising an issue not previously presented to the agency. Brief for Respondent 36-37. According to the Government, a noncitizen must give the agency an opportunity to consider an issue before raising it in court. So in the Government's view, a motion to reconsider is required when it is the only remaining mechanism for presenting a new issue, but not when the noncitizen has already presented every issue to the agency in other ways.9",Jackson,0,
2022-033,85,"That is not the scheme Congress adopted. Section 1252(d)(1) does not require noncitizens to give the agency an opportunity to consider an objection using every mechanism available. It requires exhausting only administrative remedies available  as of right. And we do not see how seeking reconsideration can qualify sometimes and not others. Instead, for the reasons already explained, it does not qualify at all. Supra, at 1116-1119.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,86,"Nor would the Government's approach cure the inconsistency identified above: The statutory scheme would still produce pointless, unexhausted petitions for review. See supra, at 1118-1120. Consider, for example, a noncitizen whose only issue  for judicial review is one she had not raised previously because the Board's decision introduced the issue. Under the Government's view, § 1252(d)(1) bars judicial review until after she pursues reconsideration. Yet, elsewhere, the statutory scheme contemplates that she immediately petition for judicial review of the Board's initial, prereconsideration decision. See ibid., §§ 1252(b)(1), (6), 1229a(c)(6)(B). Any such petition is a worthless exercise, however, if it is unexhausted by definition, as the Government maintains.",Jackson,0,
2022-033,87,"The Government's approach would also introduce practical difficulties. If motions to reconsider are required only sometimes, what cases qualify? In this very case, the members of the Court of Appeals panel disagreed about whether a motion to reconsider was required under the Government's rule, largely because they differed over whether Santos-Zacaria had asserted adequately to the Board earlier that new factfinding would be impermissible. Compare 22 F.4th at 573 (majority opinion), with id., at 575 (Higginson, J., dissenting). And how are noncitizens—already navigating a complex bureaucracy, often pro se and in a foreign language—to tell the difference? The Government's position presents a world of administrability headaches for courts, traps for unwary noncitizens, and mountains of reconsideration requests for the Board (filed out of an abundance of caution by noncitizens unsure of the need to seek reconsideration). For the reasons discussed, we are confident that Congress did not adopt such a scheme.10* * *",Jackson,0,

Along the way, Sturgis allegedly misrepresented Mr. Perez's educational progress too, awarding him inflated grades and advancing him from grade to grade regardless of his progress.

2022-034,27,"Section 1415(l) contains two salient features. First, the statute sets forth this general rule: Nothing in IDEA shall be construed to restrict the ability of individuals to seek remedies under the ADA or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities. Second, the statute offers a qualification, prohibiting certain suits with this language: Except that before the filing of a civil action under such other federal laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and (g) shall be exhausted. In turn, subsections (f) and (g) provide affected children and their parents with the right to a due process hearing before a local or state administrative official, § 1415(f)(1)(A), followed by an appeal to the state education agency, § 1415(g)(1).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,28,"The parties offer very different interpretations of § 1415(l). Mr. Perez reads the statute to require a plaintiff to exhaust the administrative processes found in subsections (f) and (g) only to the extent he pursues a suit under another federal law for remedies IDEA also provides. None of this, Mr. Perez contends, forecloses his current claim because his ADA complaint seeks only compensatory damages, a remedy everyone before us agrees IDEA cannot supply. By contrast, Sturgis reads § 1415(l) as requiring a plaintiff to exhaust subsections (f) and (g) before he may pursue a suit under another federal law if that suit seeks relief for the same underlying harm IDEA exists to address. On this view, the law bars Mr. Perez's ADA suit because it seeks relief for harms flowing from Sturgis's alleged past shortcomings in providing a free and appropriate public education—a harm IDEA exists to address —and Mr. Perez chose to settle his administrative complaint rather than exhaust § 1415(f) and (g)'s remedial processes.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,29,"If both views are plausible ones, we believe Mr. Perez's better comports with the statute's terms. Start with § 1415(l)'s first clause. It focuses our attention on remedies. A remedy denotes the means of enforcing a right, and may come in the form of, say, money damages, an injunction, or a declaratory judgment. Black's Law Dictionary 1320 (8th ed. 2004), see also 13 Oxford English Dictionary 584-585 (2d ed. 1991) (defining remedy as legal redress). The statute then proceeds to instruct that nothing in IDEA shall be construed as restricting or limiting the availability of any of these things under other federal statutes like the ADA.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,30,"Of course, § 1415(l) carves out an exception to this rule. The second clause bars individuals from seeking relief under other federal laws unless they first exhaust the procedures under subsections  (f) and (g). But, by its terms, this limiting language does not apply to all suits seeking relief that other federal laws provide. The statute's administrative exhaustion requirement applies only to suits that seek relief  also available under IDEA. And that condition simply is not met in situations like ours, where a plaintiff brings a suit under another federal law for compensatory damages—a form of relief everyone agrees IDEA does not provide.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,31,"Admittedly, our interpretation treats remedies (the key term in the first clause) as synonymous with the relief a plaintiff seeks (the critical phrase found in the second clause). But a number of contextual clues persuade us that is exactly how an ordinary reader would understand this particular provision. Not only does § 1415(l) begin by directing a reader to the subject of remedies, offering first a general and then a qualifying rule on the subject. In at least two other places, IDEA treats remedies and relief as synonyms, and we cannot conceive a persuasive reason why the statute would operate differently only here. Section 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) directs courts in IDEA cases to grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate. (Emphasis added.) That statutory instruction, we have said, authorizes courts to grant as an available remedy the reimbursement of past educational expenses. School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-370, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985) (emphasis added). Elsewhere, IDEA sometimes bars those who reject a school district's settlement offer from recovering attorney's fees for later work if the relief finally obtained is not more favorable  than the offer. § 1415(i)(3)(D)(i)(III) (emphasis added). Once more, relief means remedy.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,32,"Nor is IDEA particularly unusual in treating remedies and relief as synonyms. Other provisions in the U. S. Code do too. By way of example, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(d) provides that the limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law. (Emphases added.) Likewise, 28 U.S.C. § 3306(a)(2)-(3) indicate that the United States  may obtain  a remedy under this chapter  or  any other relief the circumstances may require. (Emphases added.)",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,33,"Influencing our thinking as well is the fact that the second clause in § 1415(l) refers to claims seeking relief available under IDEA. To seek is to ask for or request. 14 Oxford English Dictionary, at 877. And often enough the phrase seeking relief or some variant of it is used in the law to refer to the remedies a plaintiff requests. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for example, a plaintiff's complaint must include a list of requested remedies, or what the law calls a demand for the relief sought. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(3) (emphasis added), see also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(c) (similar). Many of our opinions as well similarly speak of the relief a plaintiff seeks as the remedies he requests. See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 260, 130 S.Ct. 854, 175 L.Ed.2d 713 (2010) (describing the relief South Carolina seeks as the remedies demanded in its Prayer for Relief), New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1525, 1526, 206 L.Ed.2d 798 (2020) (per curiam) (describing the precise relief that petitioners requested in the prayer as two remedies, a declaration and an injunction), Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988) (discussing 5 U.S.C. § 702's reference to an action   seeking relief other than money damages).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,34,"Faced with all this, Sturgis replies that, whatever the merits of our interpretation, precedent forecloses it. Brief for Respondents 19-20, 26-27. Specifically, the school district points to Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. 154, 137 S.Ct. 743, 197 L.Ed.2d 46 (2017). But the Court in Fry went out of its way to reserve rather than decide the question we now face. See id., at 165, n. 4, 137 S.Ct. 743, id., at 168, n. 8, 137 S.Ct. 743. And what the Court did say in Fry about the question presented there hardly advances the school district's cause here. In Fry, the Court held that § 1415(l)'s exhaustion requirement does not apply unless the plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a free and appropriate public education because that is the only `relief' IDEA's administrative processes can supply. Id., at 165, 168, 137 S.Ct. 743. This case presents an analogous but different question—whether a suit admittedly premised on the past denial of a free and appropriate education may nonetheless proceed without exhausting IDEA's administrative processes if the remedy a plaintiff seeks is not one IDEA provides. In both cases, the question is whether a plaintiff must exhaust administrative processes under IDEA that cannot supply what he seeks. And here, as in Fry, we answer in the negative.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,35,"Failing all else, Sturgis closes with an appeal to congressional purpose. Brief for Respondents 22-24. The school district worries that our understanding of § 1415(l) would frustrate Congress's wish to route claims about educational services to administrative agencies with `special expertise' in such matters. Id., at 22. But it is  our job to apply faithfully the law Congress has written, and `we cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent.' Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.S. 79, 89, 137 S.Ct. 1718, 198 L.Ed.2d 177 (2017) (quoting Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 334, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010)). Even on its own terms, it is unclear what the school district's argument proves. Either interpretation of § 1415(l) operates to preclude some unexhausted claims. Under our view, for example, a plaintiff who files an ADA action seeking both damages and the sort of equitable relief IDEA provides may find his request for equitable relief barred or deferred if he has yet to exhaust § 1415(f) and (g). Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22. It is quite mistaken to assume, too, that any interpretation of a law that does more to advance a statute's putative goal must be the law. Henson, 582 U.S., at 89, 137 S.Ct. 1718. Laws are the product of compromise, and no law `pursues its  purposes at all costs.' Ibid. And it isn't exactly difficult to imagine that a rational Congress might have sought to temper a demand for administrative exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA can supply with a rule excusing exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA cannot provide.*",Gorsuch,0,
2022-034,36,"The parties pose a number of additional questions they would like us to answer —including whether IDEA's exhaustion requirement is susceptible to a judge-made futility exception and whether the compensatory damages Mr. Perez seeks in his ADA suit are in fact available under that statute. But today, we have no occasion to address any of those things. In proceedings below, the courts held that § 1415(l) precluded Mr. Perez's ADA lawsuit. We clarify that nothing in that provision bars his way. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case  is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Gorsuch,0,

2022-036,43,"Under 18 U.S.C. § 2333, United States nationals who have been injured  by reason of an act of international terrorism may sue for damages. § 2333(a). They are not limited to suing the individual terrorists or organizations that directly carried out the attack, however. That is because § 2333(d)(2) also imposes civil liability on any person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism. Victims of terrorist acts therefore may seek to recover from those who aided and abetted the terrorist act that injured them.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,44,"The plaintiffs (who are respondents) contend that they have stated a claim for relief under § 2333(d)(2). They were allegedly injured by a terrorist attack carried out by ISIS. But plaintiffs are not suing ISIS. Instead, they have brought suit against three of the largest social-media companies in the world—Facebook, Twitter (who is petitioner), and Google (which owns YouTube)—for allegedly aiding and abetting ISIS. As plaintiffs allege, ISIS has used defendants' social-media platforms to recruit new terrorists and to raise funds for terrorism. Defendants allegedly knew that ISIS was using their platforms but failed to stop it from doing so. Plaintiffs accordingly seek to hold Facebook, Twitter, and Google liable for the terrorist attack that allegedly injured them. We conclude, however, that plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient to establish that these defendants aided and abetted ISIS in carrying out the relevant attack.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,46,"Plaintiffs' case arises from a 2017 terrorist attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey. The attack was carried out by Abdulkadir Masharipov on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).1 Born in Uzbekistan, Masharipov had received military training with al Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2011 and eventually became affiliated with ISIS. In 2016, he was ordered by ISIS to travel to Turkey and launch an attack in Istanbul on New Year's Eve. After planning and coordinating the attack with ISIS emir Abu Shuhada, Masharipov entered the Reina nightclub in the early hours of January 1, 2017, and fired over 120 rounds into a crowd of more than 700 people. In total, Masharipov killed 39 people and injured 69 others. The next day, ISIS released a statement claiming responsibility for the attack. Two weeks later, Masharipov was arrested in Istanbul after hiding out in ISIS safe houses.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,47,"One of Masharipov's victims was Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in the attack. Several members of Alassaf's family then brought the present lawsuit under § 2333, alleging that they had been injured by the attack.2 Invoking § 2333(d)(2), plaintiffs sued three major social-media companies—Facebook, Inc., Google, Inc., and Twitter, Inc.—claiming that they aided and abetted ISIS and thus were liable for the Reina nightclub attack.3",Thomas,0,
2022-036,48,"As is common knowledge, these three companies control three of the largest and most ubiquitous platforms on the internet: Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. At the time of the Reina attack, Facebook had over 2 billion active users each month, YouTube had over 1 billion, and Twitter had around 330 million.

2022-036,50,"Everyone before us today agrees on the basic aspects of these platforms' business models. People from around the world can sign up for the platforms and start posting content on them, free of charge and without much (if any) advance screening by defendants. Once on the platforms, users can upload messages, videos, and other types of content, which others on the platform can then view, respond to, and share. As noted above, billions of people have done just that. As a result, the amount of content on defendants' platforms is staggering. It appears that for every minute of the day, approximately 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube, 510,000 comments are posted on Facebook, and 347,000 tweets are sent on Twitter. See Statista, Media Usage in an Internet Minute as of April 2022 (2023), https://www.statista.com/statistics/195140/new-user-generated-content-uploaded-by-users-per-minute, Statista, YouTube-Statistics & Facts, B.

2022-036,51,"Defendants profit from this content largely by charging third parties to advertise on their platforms. Those advertisements are placed on or near the billions of videos, posts, comments, and tweets uploaded by the platforms' users. To organize and present all those advertisements and pieces of content, defendants have developed recommendation algorithms that automatically match advertisements and content with each user, the algorithms generate those outputs based on a wide range of information about the user, the advertisement, and the content being viewed. So, for example, a person who watches cooking shows on YouTube is more likely to see cooking-based videos and advertisements for cookbooks, whereas someone who likes to watch professorial lectures might see collegiate debates and advertisements for TED Talks.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,52,"But not all of the content on defendants' platforms is so benign. As plaintiffs allege, ISIS and its adherents have used these platforms for years as tools for recruiting, fundraising, and spreading their propaganda. Like many others around the world, ISIS and its supporters opened accounts on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter and uploaded videos and messages for others to see. Like most other content on those platforms, ISIS' videos and messages were then matched with other users based on those users' information and use history. And, like most other content, advertisements were displayed with ISIS' messages, posts, and videos based on information about the viewer and the content being viewed. Unlike most other content, however, ISIS' videos and messages celebrated terrorism and recruited new terrorists. For example, ISIS uploaded videos that fundraised for weapons of terror and that showed brutal executions of soldiers and civilians alike. And plaintiffs allege that these platforms have been crucial to ISIS' growth, allowing it to reach new audiences, gain new members, and spread its message of terror.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,53,"Plaintiffs also allege that defendants have known that ISIS has used their platforms for years. Yet, plaintiffs claim that defendants have failed to detect and remove a substantial number of ISIS-related accounts, posts, and videos. (For example,  plaintiffs aver that defendants have failed to implement  a basic account detection methodology to prevent ISIS supporters from generating multiple accounts on their platforms. App. 150.) Accordingly, plaintiffs assert that defendants aided and abetted ISIS by knowingly allowing ISIS and its supporters to use their platforms and benefit from their recommendation algorithms, enabling ISIS to connect with the broader public, fundraise, and radicalize new recruits. And, in the process, defendants allegedly have profited from the advertisements placed on ISIS' tweets, posts, and videos.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,54,"Plaintiffs also provide a set of allegations specific to Google. According to plaintiffs, Google has established a system that shares revenue gained from certain advertisements on YouTube with users who posted the videos watched with the advertisement. As part of that system, Google allegedly reviews and approves certain videos before Google permits ads to accompany that video. Plaintiffs allege that Google has reviewed and approved at least some ISIS videos under that system, thereby sharing some amount of revenue with ISIS.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,55,"The District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim.4 But the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged that defendants aided and abetted ISIS within the meaning of § 2333(d)(2) and thus could be held secondarily liable for the Reina nightclub attack. Gonzalez v. Google, 2 F.4th 871 (2021). We granted certiorari to resolve whether plaintiffs have adequately stated such a claim under § 2333(d)(2). See 598 U.

2022-036,57,"Section 2333 was originally enacted as part of the Antiterrorism Act (ATA) in 1990. 104 Stat. 2250. At that time, Congress authorized United States nationals or their estate, survivors, or heirs to bring civil lawsuits when injured in their person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism. Id., at 2251.5 In such a lawsuit, the plaintiff could recover treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney's fees. See 18 U.S.C. § 2333(a). But the ATA did not explicitly impose liability on anyone who only helped the terrorists carry out the attack or conspired with them. Prior to  2016, some courts accordingly determined that the ATA did not authorize that sort of secondary civil liability. See, e.g., Rothstein v. UBS AG, 708 F.3d 82, 97-98 (CA2 2013).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,58,"Then, in 2016, Congress enacted the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) to provide for a form of secondary civil liability. 130 Stat. 852. Thus, as the law now stands, those injured by an act of international terrorism can sue the relevant terrorists directly under § 2333(a)—or they can sue anyone who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism under § 2333(d)(2). For such a secondary-liability claim, there is an additional condition: The act of international terrorism must have been committed, planned, or authorized by an organization that had been designated as a foreign terrorist organization under 8 U.S.C. § 1189 as of the date on which such act of international terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized. Ibid. Plaintiffs seeking secondary liability can likewise recover treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney's fees. See §§ 2333(a), (d)(2).",Thomas,0,

The central question is thus whether defendants' conduct constitutes aiding and abetting, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, such that they can be held liable for the Reina nightclub attack. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,61,"As always, we start with the text of § 2333. See Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 74, 143 S.Ct. 665, 214 L.Ed.2d 434 (2023). Here, that text immediately begs two questions: First, what exactly does it mean to aid and abet? Second, what precisely must the defendant have aided and abetted?",Thomas,0,
2022-036,63,"We turn first to the meaning of the phrase aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance. Nothing in the statute defines any of those critical terms. Yet terms like aids and abets are familiar to the common law, which has long held aiders-and-abettors secondarily liable for the wrongful acts of others. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 181, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994). We generally presume that such common-law terms bring the old soil with them. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 733, 133 S.Ct. 2720, 186 L.Ed.2d 794 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). In enacting JASTA, Congress provided additional context by pointing to Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (CADC 1983), as providing the proper legal framework for civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability. § 2(a)(5), 130 Stat. 852.6 We thus begin with Halberstam's legal framework, viewed in context of the common-law tradition from which it arose.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,65,"Long regarded as a leading case on civil aiding-and-abetting and conspiracy liability, see 130 Stat. 852, Halberstam arose from a distinctive fact pattern. Bernard Welch was a serial burglar who had killed Michael Halberstam during a break-in. 705 F.2d, at 474. Halberstam's estate then sued Welch's live-in partner, Linda Hamilton, for aiding and abetting and conspiring with Welch. Id., at 474, 476.7 Hamilton was not present for Halberstam's murder, or even allegedly aware of the murder. See id., at 474-476. But the facts made clear that she was a willing partner in Welch's criminal activities. Id., at 474 (internal quotation marks omitted). Hamilton had lived with Welch for five years, during which time the couple had risen from modest circumstances to possess a substantial fortune. Ibid. This rapid ascent was remarkable because Welch had no outside employment. Id., at 475. Rather, he left the house most evenings and returned with antiques, jewelry, and precious metals—some of which he melted down into gold and silver ingots by using a smelting furnace that he had installed in their garage. Meanwhile, Hamilton did bookkeeping work for Welch's business, facilitating the sale of those stolen goods. Ibid. She had Welch's customers make checks payable to her, falsified her tax returns at Welch's direction, and kept records of incoming payments from Welch's customers—with no records of outgoing funds to his suppliers. Ibid. Their arrangement continued until Welch was arrested after he killed Halberstam while burglarizing Halberstam's home. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,66,"To determine Hamilton's liability, the D. C. Circuit undertook an extensive survey of the common law, examining a series of state and federal cases, the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and prominent treatises that discussed secondary liability in tort. Id., at 476-478, 481-486. With respect to aiding and abetting, the court synthesized the cases as resting on three main elements: First, the party whom the defendant aids must perform a wrongful act that causes an injury. Id., at 477. Second, the defendant must be generally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the time that he provides the assistance. Ibid. And, third, the defendant must knowingly and substantially assist the principal violation. Ibid. (citing, e.g., Landy v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 486 F.2d 139, 162-163 (CA3 1973), Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, 522 F.2d 84, 94-95 (CA5 1975)). Halberstam then articulated six factors to help determine whether a defendant's assistance was substantial. 705 F.2d, at 486-488. Those factors are (1) the nature of the act assisted, (2) the amount of assistance provided, (3) whether the defendant was present at the time of the principal tort, (4) the defendant's relation to the tortious actor, (5) the defendant's state of mind, and (6) the duration of the assistance given. Id., at 488 (emphasis deleted). Last, Halberstam clarified that those who aid and abet a tortious act may be liable not only for the act itself but also for other reasonably foreseeable acts done in connection with it. Id., at 484.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,67,"Applying that framework, the D. C. Circuit held that Hamilton was liable for aiding and abetting Halberstam's murder. Id., at 489.8 The court first determined that Welch had committed a wrong (in killing Halberstam during the burglary) and that  Hamilton was generally aware of her role in Welch's criminal enterprise, Id., at 488. It then explained that Hamilton had given knowing and substantial assistance to Welch's activities by helping him turn his stolen goods into `legitimate' wealth, thereby intending to help Welch succeed by performing a function crucial to any thief. Ibid. And it clarified that Hamilton knew Welch was committing some sort of personal property crime, the foreseeable risk of which was violence and killing. Ibid. The court therefore concluded that Hamilton substantially helped Welch commit personal property crimes and was liable for Halberstam's death, which was a foreseeable result of such crimes. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,68,"That articulation of the common law thus resolved Halberstam. But Halberstam recognized that the elements and factors it provided could be merged or articulated somewhat differently without affecting their basic thrust. Id., at 478, n. 8. It thus cautioned—in a typical common-law fashion—that its formulations should not be accepted as immutable components. Id., at 489. Rather, Halberstam suggested that its framework should be adapted as new cases test their usefulness in evaluating vicarious liability. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,70,"The allegations before us today are a far cry from the facts of Halberstam. Rather than dealing with a serial burglar and his live-in partner-in-crime, we are faced with international terrorist networks and world-spanning internet platforms. By Halberstam's own lights, its precise three-element and six-factor test thus may not be entirely adequate to resolve these new facts. Ibid. And JASTA itself points only to Halberstam's framework, not its facts or its exact phrasings and formulations, as the benchmark for aiding and abetting. § 2(a)(5), 130 Stat. 852. We therefore must ascertain the basic thrust of Halberstam's elements and determine how to adapt its framework to the facts before us today. See 705 F.2d, at 478, 489, and n. 8. To do so, we turn to the common law of aiding and abetting upon which Halberstam rested and to which JASTA's common-law terminology points.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,71,"As we have recognized, aiding and abetting is an ancient criminal law doctrine that has substantially influenced its analog in tort. Central Bank of Denver, 511 U.S., at 181, 114 S.Ct. 1439. In one early statement of the criminal-law doctrine, William Blackstone explained that those who were present, aiding and abetting the fact to be done, or procured, counseled, or commanded another to commit a crime, were guilty and punishable. 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 34, 36 (1795). Over the years, many statutes and courts have offered variations on that basic rule. See United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (CA2 1938) (L. Hand, J., for the court) (collecting authorities). Yet, to this day, the basic view of culpability that animates the doctrine is straightforward: A person may be responsible for a crime he has not personally carried out if he helps another to complete its commission. Rosemond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,72,"Importantly, the concept of helping in the commission of a crime—or a tort—has never been boundless. That is because, if it were, aiding-and-abetting liability could sweep in innocent bystanders as well as those who gave only tangential assistance. For example, assume that any assistance of any kind were sufficient to create liability. If that were the case, then anyone who passively watched a robbery could be said to commit aiding and abetting by failing to call the police. Yet, our legal system generally does not impose  liability for mere omissions, inactions, or nonfeasance, although inaction can be culpable in the face of some independent duty to act, the law does not impose a generalized duty to rescue. See 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 6.1 (3d ed. 2018) (LaFave), W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 373-375 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). Moreover, both criminal and tort law typically sanction only wrongful conduct, bad acts, and misfeasance. J. Goldberg, A. Sebok, & B. Zipursky, Tort Law: Responsibilities and Redress 31 (2004). Some level of blameworthiness is therefore ordinarily required. But, again, if aiding-and-abetting liability were taken too far, then ordinary merchants could become liable for any misuse of their goods and services, no matter how attenuated their relationship with the wrongdoer. And those who merely deliver mail or transmit emails could be liable for the tortious messages contained therein. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876, Comment d, Illus. 9, p. 318 (1979) (cautioning against this result).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,73,"For these reasons, courts have long recognized the need to cabin aiding-and-abetting liability to cases of truly culpable conduct. They have cautioned, for example, that not all those present at the commission of a trespass are liable as principals merely because they make no opposition or manifest no disapprobation of the wrongful acts of another. Brown v. Perkins, 83 Mass. 89, 98 (1861), see also Hilmes v. Stroebel, 59 Wis. 74, 17 N.W. 539 (1883), Duke v. Feldman, 245 Md. 454, 457-458, 226 A.2d 345, 347 (1967). Put another way, overly broad liability would allow for one person to be made a trespasser and even a felon against his or her consent, and by the mere rashness or precipitancy or overheated zeal of another. Bird v. Lynn, 49 Ky. 422, 423 (1850). Moreover, unlike its close cousin conspiracy, aiding and abetting does not require any agreement with the primary wrongdoer to commit wrongful acts, thus eliminating a significant limiting principle. See Nye & Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 620, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,74,"To keep aiding-and-abetting liability grounded in culpable misconduct, criminal law thus requires that a defendant `in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed' before he could be held liable. Id., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766 (quoting Peoni, 100 F.2d, at 402). In other words, the defendant has to take some affirmative act with the intent of facilitating the offense's commission. Rosemond, 572 U.S., at 71, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Such intentional participation can come in many forms, including abetting, inducing, encouraging, soliciting, or advising the commission of the offense, such as through words of encouragement or driving the getaway car. 2 LaFave § 13.2(a), at 457-460, see also J. Hawley & M. McGregor, The Criminal Law 81 (3d ed. 1899). Regardless of the particulars, however, it is clear that some culpable conduct is needed. See Rosemond, 572 U.S., at 73, 77, 134 S.Ct. 1240.9",Thomas,0,
2022-036,75,"Similar principles and concerns have shaped aiding-and-abetting doctrine in tort law, with numerous cases directly employing them to help articulate the standard  for tortious aiding and abetting. See, e.g., Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F.2d 27, 35-36 (CADC 1987), Woodward, 522 F.2d, at 95, n. 23, Landy, 486 F.2d, at 163-164 (all relying on Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766), see also Camp v. Dema, 948 F.2d 455, 459 (CA8 1991) (relying on People v. Terman, 4 Cal. App.2d 345, 346-347, 40 P.2d 915 (1935), another criminal case). Similar to the criminal-law rule, some cases have required that the defendant's assistance must have had a direct relation to the trespass, and have been calculated and intended to produce it to warrant liability for the resulting tort. Bird, 49 Ky., at 423, see also Smith v. Thompson, 103 Idaho 909, 911, 655 P.2d 116, 118 (App. 1982), Brown, 83 Mass., at 98. Other cases have emphasized the need for some culpable conduct and some degree of knowledge that a defendant's actions are aiding the primary violator before holding the defendant secondarily liable. Camp, 948 F.2d, at 460. Still others have explained that culpability of some sort is necessary to justify punishment of a secondary actor, lest mostly passive actors like banks become liable for all of their customers' crimes by virtue of carrying out routine transactions. Monsen v. Consolidated Dressed Beef Co., 579 F.2d 793, 799 (CA3 1978). And others have suggested that inaction cannot create liability as an aider and abettor absent a duty to act. Zoelsch, 824 F.2d, at 36, see also Woodward, 522 F.2d, at 96.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,76,"In articulating those limits, courts simultaneously began to crystalize the framework for aiding and abetting that Halberstam identified and applied. See, e.g., Monsen, 579 F.2d, at 799 (stating a similar three-part test).10 As in Halberstam, that framework generally required what the text of § 2333(d)(2) demands: that the defendant have given knowing and substantial assistance to the primary tortfeasor. See, e.g., Monsen, 579 F.2d, at 799, Landy, 486 F.2d, at 162-163. Notably, courts often viewed those twin requirements as working in tandem, with a lesser showing of one demanding a greater showing of the other. E.g., Woodward, 522 F.2d, at 97, Woods v. Barnett Bank of Ft. Lauderdale, 765 F.2d 1004, 1010 (CA11 1985). In other words, less substantial assistance required more scienter before a court could infer conscious and culpable assistance. See Woodward, 522 F.2d, at 97. And, vice versa, if the assistance were direct and extraordinary, then a court might more readily infer conscious participation in the underlying tort. See ibid. In moving back and forth between all these guideposts, the courts thus largely tracked the same distinctions drawn above to ensure that liability fell only on those who had abetted the underlying tort through conscious, culpable conduct. Camp, 948 F.2d, at 460.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,78,"Halberstam's framework reflected and distilled those common-law principles. Indeed, Halberstam started with a survey of many earlier common-law cases, including many of the same cases cited above. 705 F.2d, at 477, 483 (citing, e.g., Woodward, 522 F.2d, at 94-95, Landy, 486 F.2d, at 162-163, Duke, 245 Md., at 457-458, 226 A.2d, at 347). As part of that survey, Halberstam explicitly distinguished different types of aid along the same culpability axis  that grounded the common law. 705 F.2d, at 481-483. For example, Halberstam recognized that giving verbal encouragement (such as yelling `Kill him!') could be substantial assistance, id., at 481, but that passively watching an assault after hearing an assailant threaten the victim likely would not be, id., at 483. Those same lines have long been drawn for aiding-and-abetting liability under the common law. See Rosemond, 572 U.S., at 70, 134 S.Ct. 1240, see also, e.g., 2 LaFave § 13.2(a), at 457-460, Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876, Comment d, Illus. 9-10, at 318, Brown, 83 Mass., at 98. And Halberstam's six factors for substantial assistance call for the same balancing that courts had undertaken previously between the nature and amount of assistance on the one hand and the defendant's scienter on the other. 705 F.2d, at 484-485, 487-488.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,79,"Despite that deep-rooted common-law basis, the Ninth Circuit appears to have understood JASTA's approval of Halberstam's legal framework as requiring it to hew tightly to the precise formulations that Halberstam used. The parties before us similarly make a conscious effort to draw analogies to the facts of that case. But any approach that too rigidly focuses on Halberstam's facts or its exact phraseology risks missing the mark. Halberstam is by its own terms a common-law case and provided its elements and factors as a way to synthesize the common-law approach to aiding and abetting. And JASTA employs the common-law terms aids and abets, pointing to Halberstam's common-law framework as the primary guidepost for understanding the scope of § 2333(d)(2).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,80,"At bottom, both JASTA and Halberstam's elements and factors rest on the same conceptual core that has animated aiding-and-abetting liability for centuries: that the defendant consciously and culpably participated in a wrongful act so as to help make it succeed. Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766. To be sure, nuances may establish daylight between the rules for aiding and abetting in criminal and tort law, we have described the doctrines as roughly similar, not identical. Central Bank of Denver, 511 U.S., at 181, 114 S.Ct. 1439. But we need not resolve the extent of those differences today, it is enough for our purposes to recognize the framework that Halberstam set forth and the basis on which it rests. The phrase aids and abets in § 2333(d)(2), as elsewhere, refers to a conscious, voluntary, and culpable participation in another's wrongdoing.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,82,"The next question, however, is what precisely a defendant must aid and abet. As noted above, JASTA imposes liability on anyone who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism. § 2333(d)(2). The parties vigorously dispute the textual object of the term aids and abets: Plaintiffs assert that it is the person, and defendants insist that it is the act of international terrorism. So, plaintiffs contend, defendants can be liable if they aided and abetted ISIS generally— there is no need for defendants to have aided and abetted the specific Reina nightclub attack. Conversely, defendants posit that they are liable only if they directly aided and abetted the Reina nightclub attack, with a strict nexus between their assistance and that attack. Neither side is quite right.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,83,"To start, we find it unnecessary to parse whether the textual object of aids and abets is the person or the act of international terrorism. That syntactic dispute makes little difference here, because aiding and abetting is inherently a rule of  secondary liability for specific wrongful acts. See Prosser & Keeton 323. As stated above, the rule imposes liability for a wrong on those who help another to complete its commission. Rosemond, 572 U.S., at 70, 134 S.Ct. 1240 (emphasis added). Or, as Halberstam put it, the defendant must aid and abet a tortious act. 705 F.2d, at 484.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,84,"Nor would a contrary rule make sense for torts. That is because tort law imposes liability only when someone commits an actual tort, merely agreeing to commit a tort or suggesting a tortious act is not, without more, tortious. See Prosser & Keeton 324, Halberstam, 705 F.2d, at 479.11 Enterprises or conspiracies alone are therefore not tortious—the focus must remain on the tort itself. The same is true here: The ATA opens the courthouse doors only if the plaintiff is injured  by reason of an act of international terrorism. § 2333(a). JASTA further restricts secondary liability by requiring that the act of international terrorism be committed, planned, or authorized by a foreign terrorist organization designated as such as of the date on which such act of international terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized. § 2333(d). Thus, it is not enough, as plaintiffs contend, that a defendant have given substantial assistance to a transcendent enterprise separate from and floating above all the actionable wrongs that constitute it. Rather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by knowingly providing substantial assistance) another person in the commission of the actionable wrong—here, an act of international terrorism. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876(b), and Comment d, Halberstam, 705 F.2d, at 488.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,85,"Plaintiffs insist that Halberstam proves the contrary, but their argument misses the gist of that case. To be sure, Linda Hamilton was not on the scene for the burglary of Halberstam's house and did not lend any specific support to Halberstam's murder. Ibid. But Hamilton's assistance to Welch was so intentional and systematic that she assisted each and every burglary committed by Welch, any time that Welch left the house to burglarize, he would have relied on Hamilton's assistance in laundering the stolen goods and transforming them into usable wealth. See ibid. Thus, Hamilton did aid and abet Welch in burglarizing Halberstam's home—and, as noted above, killing Halberstam was a foreseeable consequence of that burglary. See ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,86,"On the other hand, defendants overstate the nexus that § 2333(d)(2) requires between the alleged assistance and the wrongful act. To start, aiding and abetting does not require the defendant to have known all particulars of the primary actor's plan. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Intentional Torts to Persons § 10, Comment c, p. 104 (Tent. Draft No. 3, Apr. 6, 2018). For example, a defendant might be held liable for aiding and abetting the burning of a building if he intentionally helped others break into the building at night and then, unknown to him, the others lit torches to guide them through the dark and accidentally started a fire. See American Family Mutual Ins. Co. v. Grim, 201 Kan. 340, 345-347, 440 P.2d 621,  625-626 (1968), Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876, Comment d, Illus. 10, at 318. That leads to the next problem: As Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and abet a tort can be held liable for other torts that were a foreseeable risk of the intended tort. 705 F.2d, at 488. Accordingly, a close nexus between the assistance and the tort might help establish that the defendant aided and abetted the tort, but even more remote support can still constitute aiding and abetting in the right case.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,87,"Moreover, in appropriate circumstances, a secondary defendant's role in an illicit enterprise can be so systemic that the secondary defendant is aiding and abetting every wrongful act committed by that enterprise—as in Halberstam itself. Id., at 487-488. At this point, aiding-and-abetting liability begins to blur with conspiracy liability, which typically holds co-conspirators liable for all reasonably foreseeable acts taken to further the conspiracy. See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647-648, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), see also Halberstam, 705 F.2d, at 482-483 (noting the occasional overlap). Yet, as noted above, aiding and abetting lacks the requisite agreement that justifies such extensive conspiracy liability. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876, Comment a, at 316 (The theory of the early common law was that there was mutual agency of each conspirator to act for the others), Pinkerton, 328 U.S., at 646, 66 S.Ct. 1180. Thus, while the facts of Halberstam are not totemic (lest courts strain to compare Linda Hamilton with international criminal syndicates), its facts are useful when determining whether a defendant has so consciously participated in a series of tortious acts in order to make each one succeed. Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766 (internal quotation marks omitted).* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-036,88,"To summarize the requirements of § 2333(d)(2), the phrase aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, points to the elements and factors articulated by Halberstam. But, those elements and factors should not be taken as inflexible codes, rather, they should be understood in light of the common law and applied as a framework designed to hold defendants liable when they consciously and culpably participated in a tortious act in such a way as to help make it succeed. Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the text requires that defendants have aided and abetted the act of international terrorism that injured the plaintiffs—though that requirement does not always demand a strict nexus between the alleged assistance and the terrorist act.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,90,"Under the appropriate framework, some aspects of today's case become immediately clear: First, because they are trying to hold defendants liable for the Reina attack, plaintiffs must plausibly allege that defendants aided and abetted ISIS12 in carrying out that attack. Next, plaintiffs have satisfied Halberstam's first two elements by alleging both that ISIS committed a wrong and that defendants knew they were playing some sort of role in ISIS' enterprise.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,91,"The key question, therefore, is whether defendants gave such knowing and substantial assistance to ISIS that they culpably participated in the Reina attack. The allegations here fall short of that showing under Halberstam's framework as properly understood by reference to the common-law principles it applied.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,93,"To start, recall the basic ways that defendants as a group allegedly helped ISIS. First, ISIS was active on defendants' social-media platforms, which are generally available to the internet-using public with little to no front-end screening by defendants. In other words, ISIS was able to upload content to the platforms and connect with third parties, just like everyone else. Second, defendants' recommendation algorithms matched ISIS-related content to users most likely to be interested in that content—again, just like any other content. And, third, defendants allegedly knew that ISIS was uploading this content to such effect, but took insufficient steps to ensure that ISIS supporters and ISIS-related content were removed from their platforms. Notably, plaintiffs never allege that ISIS used defendants' platforms to plan or coordinate the Reina attack, in fact, they do not allege that Masharipov himself ever used Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,94,"None of those allegations suggest that defendants culpably associated themselves with the Reina attack, participated in it as something that they wished to bring about, or sought by their action to make it succeed. Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766 (internal quotation marks omitted). In part, that is because the only affirmative conduct defendants allegedly undertook was creating their platforms and setting up their algorithms to display content relevant to user inputs and user history. Plaintiffs never allege that, after defendants established their platforms, they gave ISIS any special treatment or words of encouragement. Nor is there reason to think that defendants selected or took any action at all with respect to ISIS' content (except, perhaps, blocking some of it).13 Indeed, there is not even reason to think that defendants carefully screened any content before allowing users to upload it onto their platforms. If anything, the opposite is true: By plaintiffs' own allegations, these platforms appear to transmit most content without inspecting it.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,95,"The mere creation of those platforms, however, is not culpable. To be sure, it might be that bad actors like ISIS are able to use platforms like defendants' for illegal—and sometimes terrible—ends. But the same could be said of cell phones, email, or the internet generally. Yet, we generally do not think that internet or cell service providers incur culpability merely for providing their services to the public writ large. Nor do we think that such providers would normally be described as aiding and abetting, for example, illegal drug deals brokered over cell phones—even if the provider's conference-call or video-call features made the sale easier. See Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, 659 (CA7 2003).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,96,"To be sure, plaintiffs assert that defendants' recommendation algorithms go beyond passive aid and constitute active, substantial assistance. We disagree. By plaintiffs' own telling, their claim is based on defendants' provision of the infrastructure which provides material support to ISIS. App. 53. Viewed properly, defendants'  recommendation algorithms are merely part of that infrastructure. All the content on their platforms is filtered through these algorithms, which allegedly sort the content by information and inputs provided by users and found in the content itself. As presented here, the algorithms appear agnostic as to the nature of the content, matching any content (including ISIS' content) with any user who is more likely to view that content. The fact that these algorithms matched some ISIS content with some users thus does not convert defendants' passive assistance into active abetting. Once the platform and sorting-tool algorithms were up and running, defendants at most allegedly stood back and watched, they are not alleged to have taken any further action with respect to ISIS.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,97,"At bottom, then, the claim here rests less on affirmative misconduct and more on an alleged failure to stop ISIS from using these platforms. But, as noted above, both tort and criminal law have long been leery of imposing aiding-and-abetting liability for mere passive nonfeasance. To show that defendants' failure to stop ISIS from using these platforms is somehow culpable with respect to the Reina attack, a strong showing of assistance and scienter would thus be required. Plaintiffs have not made that showing.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,98,"First, the relationship between defendants and the Reina attack is highly attenuated. As noted above, defendants' platforms are global in scale and allow hundreds of millions (or billions) of people to upload vast quantities of information on a daily basis. Yet, there are no allegations that defendants treated ISIS any differently from anyone else. Rather, defendants' relationship with ISIS and its supporters appears to have been the same as their relationship with their billion-plus other users: arm's length, passive, and largely indifferent. Cf. Halberstam, 705 F.2d, at 488. And their relationship with the Reina attack is even further removed, given the lack of allegations connecting the Reina attack with ISIS' use of these platforms.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,99,"Second, because of the distance between defendants' acts (or failures to act) and the Reina attack, plaintiffs would need some other very good reason to think that defendants were consciously trying to help or otherwise participate in the Reina attack. Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S., at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766 (internal quotation marks omitted). But they have offered no such reason, let alone a good one. Again, plaintiffs point to no act of encouraging, soliciting, or advising the commission of the Reina attack that would normally support an aiding-and-abetting claim. See 2 LaFave § 13.2(a), at 457. Rather, they essentially portray defendants as bystanders, watching passively as ISIS carried out its nefarious schemes. Such allegations do not state a claim for culpable assistance or participation in the Reina attack. See Halberstam, 705 F.2d, at 481, 483.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,100,"Because plaintiffs' complaint rests so heavily on defendants' failure to act, their claims might have more purchase if they could identify some independent duty in tort that would have required defendants to remove ISIS' content. See Woodward, 522 F.2d, at 97, 100. But plaintiffs identify no duty that would require defendants or other communication-providing services to terminate customers after discovering that the customers were using the service for illicit ends. See Doe, 347 F.3d, at 659, People v. Brophy, 49 Cal.App.2d 15, 33-34, 120 P.2d 946 (1942).14 To be sure, there  may be situations where some such duty exists, and we need not resolve the issue today. Even if there were such a duty here, it would not transform defendants' distant inaction into knowing and substantial assistance that could establish aiding and abetting the Reina attack.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,101,"If there were any doubt, the expansive scope of plaintiffs' claims would put it to rest. Given the lack of any concrete nexus between defendants' services and the Reina attack, plaintiffs' claims would necessarily hold defendants liable as having aided and abetted each and every ISIS terrorist act committed anywhere in the world. Under plaintiffs' theory, any U. S. national victimized by an ISIS attack could bring the same claim based on the same services allegedly provided to ISIS. Plaintiffs thus must allege that defendants so systemically and pervasively assisted ISIS that defendants could be said to aid and abet every single ISIS attack. Viewed in that light, the allegations here certainly fall short. Plaintiffs do not claim that defendants intentionally associated themselves with ISIS' operations or affirmatively gave aid that would assist each of ISIS' terrorist acts. Nor have they alleged that defendants and ISIS formed a near-common enterprise of the kind that could establish such broad liability. These allegations are thus a far cry from the type of pervasive, systemic, and culpable assistance to a series of terrorist activities that could be described as aiding and abetting each terrorist act.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,102,"To be sure, we cannot rule out the possibility that some set of allegations involving aid to a known terrorist group would justify holding a secondary defendant liable for all of the group's actions or perhaps some definable subset of terrorist acts. There may be, for example, situations where the provider of routine services does so in an unusual way or provides such dangerous wares that selling those goods to a terrorist group could constitute aiding and abetting a foreseeable terror attack. Cf. Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 707, 711-712, 714-715, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943) (registered morphine distributor could be liable as a coconspirator of an illicit operation to which it mailed morphine far in excess of normal amounts). Or, if a platform consciously and selectively chose to promote content provided by a particular terrorist group, perhaps it could be said to have culpably assisted the terrorist group. Cf. Passaic Daily News v. Blair, 63 N.J. 474, 487-488, 308 A.2d 649, 656 (1973) (publishing employment advertisements that discriminate on the basis of sex could aid and abet the discrimination).",Thomas,0,
2022-036,103,"In those cases, the defendants would arguably have offered aid that is more direct, active, and substantial than what we review here, in such cases, plaintiffs might be able to establish liability with a lesser showing of scienter. But we need not consider every iteration on this theme. In this case, it is enough that there is no allegation that the platforms here do more than transmit information by billions of people, most of whom use the platforms for interactions that once took place via mail, on the phone, or in public areas. The fact that some bad actors took advantage of these platforms is insufficient to state a claim that defendants knowingly gave substantial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those wrongdoers' acts. And that  is particularly true because a contrary holding would effectively hold any sort of communication provider liable for any sort of wrongdoing merely for knowing that the wrongdoers were using its services and failing to stop them. That conclusion would run roughshod over the typical limits on tort liability and take aiding and abetting far beyond its essential culpability moorings.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,105,"In holding that plaintiffs had stated a claim, the Ninth Circuit went astray through a series of missteps that, together, obscured the essence of aiding-and-abetting liability. To correct those errors, we proceed through the Ninth Circuit's application of Halberstam's framework.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,106,"The Ninth Circuit framed the issue of substantial assistance as turning on defendants' assistance to ISIS' activities in general. See 2 F.4th, at 909. But, as we explained above, the question is whether defendants gave substantial assistance to ISIS with respect to the Reina attack. The focus thus must remain on the Reina attack, plaintiffs' failure to allege any definable nexus between the defendants' assistance and that attack therefore—at minimum—drastically increases their burden to show that defendants somehow consciously and culpably assisted the attack.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,107,"Next, the Ninth Circuit misapplied the knowing half of knowing and substantial assistance. It first separated the knowing and substantial subelements, it then analyzed the knowing subelement as a carbon copy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were generally aware of their role in ISIS' overall scheme. Ibid., see also id., at 908. But, as discussed above, the knowledge and substantial assistance components should be considered relative to one another as part of a single inquiry designed to capture conscious and culpable conduct. Camp, 948 F.2d, at 459 (internal quotation marks omitted). The knowing part of that inquiry is therefore designed to capture the defendants' state of mind with respect to their actions and the tortious conduct (even if not always the particular terrorist act), not the same general awareness that defines Halberstam's second element.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,108,"Finally, when applying Halberstam's six substantiality factors, the Ninth Circuit appears to have regarded the factors as a sequence of disparate, unrelated considerations without a common conceptual core. See 2 F.4th, at 909-910. That is incorrect. The point of those factors is to help courts capture the essence of aiding and abetting: participation in another's wrongdoing that is both significant and culpable enough to justify attributing the principal wrongdoing to the aider and abettor. The Ninth Circuit thus erred in focusing (as it did) primarily on the value of defendants' platforms to ISIS, rather than whether defendants culpably associated themselves with ISIS' actions. For example, when applying the second factor (the amount and kind of assistance), the Ninth Circuit should have considered that defendants' platforms and content-sorting algorithms were generally available to the internet-using public. That focus reveals that ISIS' ability to benefit from these platforms was merely incidental to defendants' services and general business models, it was not attributable to any culpable conduct of defendants directed toward ISIS. And, when considering the fourth and fifth factors (the defendants' relationship to ISIS and the defendants' state of mind), the Ninth Circuit should have given much greater weight to defendants' arm's-length relationship with ISIS—which was essentially no different from their relationship  with their millions or billions of other users—and their undisputed lack of intent to support ISIS. See id., at 910.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,109,"Taken as a whole, the Ninth Circuit's analytic approach thus elided the fundamental question of aiding-and-abetting liability: Did defendants consciously, voluntarily, and culpably participate in or support the relevant wrongdoing? As we have explained above, the answer in this case is no. Plaintiffs allege only that defendants supplied generally available virtual platforms that ISIS made use of, and that defendants failed to stop ISIS despite knowing it was using those platforms. Given the lack of nexus between that assistance and the Reina attack, the lack of any defendant intending to assist ISIS, and the lack of any sort of affirmative and culpable misconduct that would aid ISIS, plaintiffs' claims fall far short of plausibly alleging that defendants aided and abetted the Reina attack.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,111,"That leaves the set of allegations specific to Google. As explained above, plaintiffs allege that Google reviewed and approved ISIS videos on YouTube as part of its revenue-sharing system and thereby shared advertising revenue with ISIS. The Ninth Circuit briefly mentioned those allegations when analyzing plaintiffs' complaint here. However, in addressing another, materially identical complaint, the Ninth Circuit held that the same allegations failed to state a claim for aiding-and-abetting liability because they were devoid of any allegations about how much assistance Google provided and therefore did not plausibly allege that Google's assistance was substantial. Id., at 907.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,112,"We think that the Ninth Circuit was correct in that holding. The complaint here alleges nothing about the amount of money that Google supposedly shared with ISIS, the number of accounts approved for revenue sharing, or the content of the videos that were approved. It thus could be the case that Google approved only one ISIS-related video and shared only $50 with someone affiliated with ISIS, the complaint simply does not say, nor does it give any other reason to view Google's revenue sharing as substantial assistance. Without more, plaintiffs thus have not plausibly alleged that Google knowingly provided substantial assistance to the Reina attack, let alone (as their theory of liability requires) every single terrorist act committed by ISIS.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,114,"By their very nature, the concepts of aiding and abetting and substantial assistance do not lend themselves to crisp, bright-line distinctions. However, both the common law and Halberstam provide some clear guideposts: The point of aiding and abetting is to impose liability on those who consciously and culpably participated in the tort at issue. The focus must remain on assistance to the tort for which plaintiffs seek to impose liability. When there is a direct nexus between the defendant's acts and the tort, courts may more easily infer such culpable assistance. But, the more attenuated the nexus, the more courts should demand that plaintiffs show culpable participation through intentional aid that substantially furthered the tort. And, if a plaintiff's theory would hold a defendant liable for all the torts of an enterprise, then a showing of pervasive and systemic aid is required to ensure that defendants actually aided and abetted each tort of that enterprise.",Thomas,0,
2022-036,115,"Here, however, the nexus between defendants and the Reina attack is far removed. As alleged by plaintiffs, defendants designed virtual platforms and knowingly failed to do enough to remove ISIS-affiliated users and ISIS-related content—  out of hundreds of millions of users worldwide and an immense ocean of content—from their platforms. Yet, plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendants intentionally provided any substantial aid to the Reina attack or otherwise consciously participated in the Reina attack—much less that defendants so pervasively and systemically assisted ISIS as to render them liable for every ISIS attack. Plaintiffs accordingly have failed to state a claim under § 2333(d)(2).",Thomas,0,

2022-036,119,"I join the opinion of the Court with the understanding that today's decisions are narrow in important respects. In this case and its companion, Gonzalez v. Google, 598 U. S. ___, 143 S.Ct. 1191, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023) (per curiam), the Court has applied 18 U.S.C. § 2333(d)(2) to two closely related complaints, filed by the same counsel. Both cases came to this Court at the motion-to-dismiss stage, with no factual record. And the Court's view of the facts—including its characterizations of the social-media platforms and algorithms at issue—properly rests on the particular allegations in those complaints. Other cases presenting different allegations and different records may lead to different conclusions.",Jackson,0,

2022-037,29,"There is no dispute that petitioner David Fox Dubin overbilled Medicaid for psychological testing. The question is whether, in defrauding Medicaid, he also committed aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1), triggering a mandatory 2-year prison sentence. The Fifth Circuit found that he did, based on a reading of the statute that covers defendants who fraudulently inflate the price of a service or good they actually provided. On that sweeping reading, as long as a billing or payment method employs another person's name or other identifying information, that is enough. A lawyer who rounds up her hours from 2.9 to 3 and bills her client electronically has committed aggravated identity theft. The same is true of a waiter who serves flank steak but charges for filet mignon using an electronic payment method.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,30,"The text and context of the statute do not support such a boundless interpretation. Instead, § 1028A(a)(1) is violated when the defendant's misuse of another person's means of identification is at the crux of what makes the underlying offense criminal, rather than merely an ancillary feature of a billing method. Here, the crux of petitioner's overbilling was inflating the value of services actually provided, while the patient's means of identification was an ancillary part of the Medicaid billing process.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,32,"David Dubin helped his father manage a psychological services company. This company submitted a claim for reimbursement to Medicaid for psychological testing by a licensed psychologist. In fact, however, the claim overstated the qualifications of the employee who actually performed the testing and who was only a licensed psychological associate. This falsehood inflated the amount of reimbursement. Petitioner also changed the date on which the examination occurred.1 Even with the inflation, the total reimbursement was only $338. App. 49. Petitioner was accordingly charged with healthcare fraud, a federal offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1347. According to the Government, however, petitioner's conduct also constituted aggravated identity theft under § 1028A(a)(1).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,33,"Section 1028A(a)(1) applies when a defendant, during and in relation to any predicate offense, knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person. The predicate offenses include, among many others, healthcare fraud. § 1028A(c)(4). Section 1028A(a)(1) carries a severe penalty: a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison in addition to the punishment for the predicate offense.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,34,"According to the Government, this is a clear aggravated identity theft case. The Government argued at trial that § 1028A(a)(1) was automatically satisfied because petitioner's fraudulent billing included the patient's Medicaid reimbursement number (a means of identification). The District Court was less sure. This doesn't seem to be an aggravated identity theft case the court explained, as the whole crux of this case is how petitioner was billing. App. 37-38. This overbilling was criminal, but it wasn't aggravated identity theft. Id., at 38. Nevertheless, the District Court denied petitioner's post-trial challenge to his aggravated identity theft  conviction, explaining that contrary Fifth Circuit precedent tied its hands. The court said that it hoped it would get reversed. Id., at 39.",Sotomayor,0,

Five judges who agreed with the Government nonetheless acknowledged that under the Government's reading of § 1028A(a)(1), the elements of the offense are not captured or even fairly described by the words `identity theft.' 27 F.4th 1021, 1024 (2022) (RICHMAN, C. J., concurring). Eight dissenting judges agreed on this point.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,36,"This type of prosecution is not uncommon. The Government has, by its own admission, wielded § 1028A(a)(1) well beyond ordinary understandings of identity theft. One prosecution targeted a defendant who made a counterfeit handgun permit for another person, using that person's real name and at that person's request. United States v. Spears, 729 F.3d 753, 754 (C.A.7 2013) (en banc). Another involved unlicensed doctors who violated the law by issuing prescriptions that their actual patients would then fill at pharmacies. United States v. Berroa, 856 F.3d 141, 148, 155-156 (C.A.1 2017). There was also a prosecution involving an ambulance service inflating its reimbursement rates by mischaracterizing the nature of the transports, saying that the patients had required stretchers when they had not. United States v. Michael, 882 F.3d 624, 628 (C.A.6 2018) (citing United States v. Medlock, 792 F.3d 700, 705 (C.A.6 2015)). Yet another prosecution involved a defendant who provided massage services to patients to treat their pain, but improperly billed this as a Medicare-eligible physical therapy service. United States v. Hong, 938 F.3d 1040, 1051 (C.A.9 2019).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,37,"Many lower courts have responded to such prosecutions with more restrained readings of the aggravated identity theft statute.2 The Fifth Circuit did not. To resolve the conflict in the courts below, this Court granted certiorari, 598 U.

2022-037,41,"The Government reads the terms broadly and in isolation. On the Government's view, a defendant uses a means of identification `in relation to' a predicate offense if the use of that means of identification `facilitates or furthers' the predicate offense in some way. Brief for United States 10 (quoting Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 232, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)). As to uses, the Government seems just to mean employs in any sense. Brief for United States 5, 7, 10-11. Section 1028A(a)(1) would thus apply automatically any time a name or other means of identification happens to be part of the payment or billing method used in  the commission of a long list of predicate offenses. In other words, virtually all of the time.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,42,"Petitioner, in response, offers a more targeted reading. For petitioner, using a means of identification in relation to a predicate offense requires a genuine nexus to the predicate offense. Brief for Petitioner 15. On this reading, the means of identification is at the crux of what makes the predicate offense criminal, rather than merely an ancillary feature of a payment method. When the underlying crime involves fraud or deceit, as many of § 1028A's predicates do, this entails using a means of identification specifically in a fraudulent or deceitful manner.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,43,"To illustrate, petitioner borrows a heuristic from the Sixth Circuit. See Michael, 882 F.3d at 628. The relevant language in § 1028A(a)(1) covers misrepresenting who received a certain service, but not fraudulent claims regarding how or when a service was performed. Brief for Petitioner 15. In other words, fraud going to identity, not misrepresentation about services actually provided. Take an ambulance service that actually transported patients but inflated the number of miles driven. The crux of this fraud was how services were rendered, the patients' names were part of the billing process, but ancillary to what made the conduct fraudulent. See Michael, 882 F.3d at 628-629. In contrast, take the pharmacist who swipes information from the pharmacy's files and uses it to open a bank account in a patient's name. That misuse of the means of identification would be integral to what made the conduct fraudulent, because misrepresentation about who was involved was at the crux of the fraud. Id., at 629.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,44,"In deciding between the parties' readings, one limited and one near limitless, precedent and prudence require a careful examination of § 1028A(a)(1)'s text and structure. While uses and in relation to are, in isolation, indeterminate, the statutory context, taken as a whole, points to a narrower reading.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,46,"In interpreting the scope of uses and in relation to, the Court begins with those terms themselves. Both terms have been singled out by this Court as particularly sensitive to context, and they do not, standing alone, conclusively resolve this case.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,47,"Start with uses. As the Court has observed more than once, the word `use' poses some interpretational difficulties because of the different meanings attributable to it. Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 143, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), see also Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). The `ordinary or natural meaning' of `use' is variously defined as `to convert to one's service,' `to employ,' `to avail oneself of,' and `to carry out a purpose or action by means of.' Bailey, 516 U.S. at 145, 116 S.Ct. 501. These various definitions of `use' imply action and implementation. Ibid. Beyond that general concept, however, `use' takes on different meanings depending on context, and because it draws meaning from its context, we will look not only to the word itself, but also to the statute and the surrounding scheme, to determine the meaning Congress intended. Id., at 143, 116 S.Ct. 501, see also Leocal, 543 U.S. at 9, 125 S.Ct. 377 (Particularly when interpreting a statute that features as elastic a word as `use,' we construe language in its context and in light of the terms surrounding it).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,48,"For example, the federal arson statute only applies to buildings `used in' commerce or commerce-affecting activity.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,49,"Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 850-851, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). In that statutory context, the Court distinguished between uses of a building as the locus of any commercial undertaking, and noncovered passive, passing, or ancillary uses of a building as collateral to obtain and secure a mortgage or to obtain an insurance policy. Id., at 855-856, 120 S.Ct. 1904. It is statutory context, therefore, that determines what kind of active employment or conversion to one's service triggers § 1028A(a)(1)'s harsh penalty.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,50,"In relation to is similarly context sensitive. If `relate to' were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes there would be no limits, as `really, universally, relations stop nowhere.' New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995) (quoting H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York ed., World's Classics 1980)). This language thus cannot be considered in isolation, Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 59, 133 S.Ct. 2191, 186 L.Ed.2d 275 (2013), and the Court must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining this key term and look to statutory context. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 656, 115 S.Ct. 1671. That the phrase refers to a relationship or nexus of some kind is clear. See Smith, 508 U.S. at 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050 (`In relation to' requires some purpose or effect between two things). Yet the kind of relationship required, its nature and strength, will be informed by context.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,51,"The presence of two such context-dependent terms renders § 1028A(a)(1) doubly attuned to its surroundings. The parties' competing readings both fall within the range of meanings of uses and in relation to, taken alone. Resort to context is thus especially necessary here.4",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,53,"Having found the key terms use and in relation to indeterminate, the next step is to look to their surrounding words. After all, a statute's meaning does not always turn solely on the broadest imaginable definitions of its component words. Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1612, 1631, 200 L.Ed.2d 889 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, linguistic and statutory context also matter. Ibid. Even in cases where the literal language of the statute is neutral in isolation, reading the whole phrase can point to a more targeted reading. Marinello v. United States, 584 U.

2022-037,54,"Such is the case here. Section 1028A(a)(1)'s title and terms both point to a narrower reading, one centered around  the ordinary understanding of identity theft. This cuts against the Government's broad reading, which the Government admits bears little relationship to the common understanding of identity theft. In contrast, a more targeted reading accurately captures the ordinary understanding of identity theft, where misuse of a means of identification is at the crux of the criminality.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,56,"Start at the top, with the words Congress chose for § 1028A's title: Aggravated identity theft. 118 Stat. 831. This Court has long considered that `the title of a statute and the heading of a section' are `tools available for the resolution of a doubt' about the meaning of a statute. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 234, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-529, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947)). A title will not, of course, override the plain words of a statute. Fulton v. Philadelphia, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1868, 1879, 210 L.Ed.2d 137 (2021). Yet here, the key terms are so elastic that they must be construed in light of the terms surrounding them, Leocal, 543 U.S. at 9, 125 S.Ct. 377, and the title Congress chose is among those terms. Even the Government acknowledged that if the terms in § 1028A(a)(1) are unclear, the title is a useful clue. Tr. of Oral Arg. 80.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,57,"Two additional points bolster this approach. First, the title here is not serving the unenviable role of pithily summarizing a list of complicated and prolific provisions. Trainmen, 331 U.S. at 528, 67 S.Ct. 1387. Section 1028A is a focused, standalone provision. Second, a title is especially valuable where it reinforces what the text's nouns and verbs independently suggest. Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 552, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015) (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). As explained below, § 1028A(a)(1)'s text independently suggests a focus on identity theft. See infra, at 1569-1571.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,58,"Indeed, this Court has already once used § 1028A's title and place in the statutory scheme to shed light on its text. In Flores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), this Court pointed out that a neighboring provision, § 1028, carries the broad title `Fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features, and information.' Id., at 655, 129 S.Ct. 1886. Section 1028A, in contrast, is far more targeted, using the words `identity theft.' Ibid. That Congress separated the identity fraud crime from the identity theft crime in § 1028A suggests that § 1028A is focused on identity theft specifically, rather than all fraud involving means of identification. Ibid.5",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,59,"Given that, it is abundantly clear why the Government urges the Court to ignore the title. The Government's broad reading, covering any time another person's means of identification is employed in a way that facilitates a crime, bears little resemblance to any ordinary meaning of identity theft. Consider again an unlicensed doctor who fills out a prescription actually requested  by a patient, no one would call that identity theft. Even judges below who agreed with the Government's reading of § 1028A(a)(1), and ultimately the Government itself, acknowledged that its reading of § 1028A(a)(1) does not fairly capture the ordinary meaning of identity theft. Nor is the difference just around the edges, the Government's reading would, in practice, place garden-variety overbilling at the core of § 1028A.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,60,"Instead, identity theft has a focused meaning. One dictionary defines identity theft as the fraudulent appropriation and use of another person's identifying data or documents, as a credit card. Webster's Unabridged Dictionary xi (2d ed. 2001) (Webster's). Another similarly offers the unlawful taking and use of another person's identifying information for fraudulent purposes, specifically a crime in which someone steals personal information about and belonging to another, such as a bank-account number or driver's-license number, and uses the information to deceive others. Black's Law Dictionary 894 (11th ed. 2019) (Black's) (defining identity theft).6",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,61,"This supports a reading of in relation to where use of the means of identification is at the crux of the underlying criminality. These definitions refer to offenses built around what the defendant does with the means of identification in particular. In other words, the means of identification specifically is a key mover in the criminality. This central role played by the means of identification, which serves to designate a specific person's identity, explains why we say that the identity itself has been stolen. See, e.g., Spears, 729 F.3d at 756 (identity theft occurs when someone's identity has been stolen or misappropriated). This helps explain why the examples resulting from the Government's theory do not sound like identity theft. If a lawyer rounds up her hours from 2.9 to 3 and bills her client using his name, the name itself is not specifically a source of fraud, it only plays an ancillary role in the billing process. The same is true for the waiter who substitutes one cut of meat for another, we might say the filet mignon's identity was stolen, perhaps, but not the diner's.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,62,"This understanding of identity theft also supports a more targeted definition of uses. The word use appears in these definitions with a specific meaning: Identity theft encompasses when a defendant uses the information to deceive others, Black's 894 (emphasis added), and the fraudulent  use of a means of identification, Webster's xi (emphasis added). In other words, identity theft is committed when a defendant uses the means of identification itself to defraud or deceive. This tracks the Sixth Circuit's heuristic. When a means of identification is used deceptively, this deception goes to who is involved, rather than just how or when services were provided. Use of the means of identification would therefore be at the locus of the criminal undertaking, rather than merely passive, passing, or ancillary employment in a crime. Jones, 529 U.S. at 855-856, 120 S.Ct. 1904.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,63,"On top of that, § 1028A's title is not just identity theft, but Aggravated identity theft. Typically, an `aggravated' offense is one `made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another crime.' Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. 563, 574, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010)  (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 75 (9th ed. 2009)). This suggests that Congress had in mind a particularly serious form of identity theft. Yet the Government's reading would apply an `aggravated'  label to all manner of everyday overbilling offenses. Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.S. at 574, 130 S.Ct. 2577. Of course  Congress, like `Humpty Dumpty,' has the power to give words unorthodox meanings. Id., at 575, 130 S.Ct. 2577. Yet where the Government argues for a result that the English language tells us not to expect, we must be very wary of the Government's position. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,64,"The title suggests identity theft is at the core of § 1028A(a)(1). On the Government's reading, however, everyday overbilling would become the most common trigger for § 1028A(a)(1)'s severe penalty. This would turn the core of worse or more serious identity theft into something the ordinary user of the English language would not consider identity theft at all.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,66,"The title is, by definition, just the beginning. A title does not supplant the actual text of the provision, as the Government observes. The problem for the Government is that § 1028A(a)(1)'s language points in the same direction as its title. In particular, Congress used a trio of verbs that reflect an ordinary understanding of identity theft.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,67,"While uses is indeterminate in isolation, here it has company. Section 1028A(a)(1) applies when a defendant knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person, during and in relation to any predicate offense. (Emphasis added.) Under the familiar interpretive canon noscitur a sociis, `a word is known by the company it keeps.' McDonnell v. United States, 579 U.S. 550, 568-569, 136 S.Ct. 2355, 195 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016) (quoting Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961)). This canon is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress. McDonnell, 579 U.S. at 569, 136 S.Ct. 2355 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,68,"The two neighboring verbs here, transfers and possesses, are most naturally read in the context of § 1028A(a)(1) to connote theft. While it is not necessary to determine the precise metes and bounds of these two verbs, their role in the provision points to this targeted reading. Section 1028A(a)(1) covers unlawful possession or transfer of a means of identification belonging to another person. Generally, to unlawfully possess something belonging to another person suggests it has been stolen. And to unlawfully transfer something belonging to another person similarly connotes misappropriating it and passing it along. In Flores-Figueroa, this Court drew a similarly intuitive link between a defendant taking a means of identification he knows belongs to another person and `theft.' 556 U.S. at 655, 129 S.Ct. 1886. The Government, at argument, agreed: these two verbs refer to circumstances in which the information is stolen. Tr. of Oral Arg. 90.7  Transfer and possess not only connote theft, but identity theft in particular. The verbs point to (1) theft of a (2) means of identification belonging to (3) another person. That tracks ordinary understandings of identity theft: a crime in which someone 1 steals 2 personal information about and 3 belonging to another. Black's 894. Similarly, the 1 fraudulent appropriation and use of 3 another person's 2 identifying data or documents. Webster's xi. If this parallel were not enough, § 1028A(a)(1)'s title indicates that the type of theft its verbs connote is identity theft specifically.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,69,"Because transfer and possess channel ordinary identity theft, noscitur a sociis indicates that uses should be read in a similar manner to its companions. See McDonnell, 579 U.S. at 568-569, 136 S.Ct. 2355. Uses is quite amenable to such a reading, and not just because of its indeterminacy. As explained above, using another person's means of identification to deceive or defraud is a common feature of identity theft. See Webster's xi (the fraudulent  use of a means of identification (emphasis added)), Black's 894 (when a defendant uses the information to deceive others (emphasis added)).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,70,"Congress thus employed a trio of verbs that capture various aspects of classic identity theft. Flores-Figueroa, 556 U.S. at 656, 129 S.Ct. 1886. There is the defendant who has gone through someone else's trash to find discarded credit card and bank statements, ibid., and thus has taken possession unlawfully. There is the bank employee who passes along customer information to an accomplice, and thus transfers it unlawfully. Then there is use involving fraud or deceit about identity: a defendant who has used another person's identification information to get access to that person's bank account. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,71,"Another canon of construction offers a further point in favor of this narrow interpretation. The Court assumes that Congress used three terms because it intended each term to a have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning. Bailey, 516 U.S. at 146, 116 S.Ct. 501. Reading § 1028A(a)(1)'s operative verbs as tracking aspects of classic identity theft, each verb has an independent role to play. As the definitions reveal, identity theft covers both when someone steals personal information about and belonging to another  and uses the information to deceive others, Black's 894 (emphasis added), and fraudulent appropriation and use, Webster's xi (emphasis added). Identity theft thus intermingles aspects of theft and fraud, misappropriation and deceitful use. Section 1028A(a)(1)'s three verbs capture this complexity. While transfer and possess conjure up two steps of theft, uses supplies the deceitful use aspect.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,72,"In contrast, if § 1028A(a)(1)'s verbs do not track identity theft and if the means of identification need only facilitate the predicate offense, the other two verbs threaten to leave uses without virtually any function. Bailey, 516 U.S. at 146, 116 S.Ct. 501. Return to a definition of in relation to that just means `facilitates or furthers' the predicate offense in some way. Brief for United States 10. In virtually all cases where a defendant employs a means of identification to facilitate a crime, the defendant will also possess or transfer the means of identification in a way that facilitates the crime. For example, petitioner's possession of the patient's means of identification facilitated the fraud, as did petitioner's transfer of the patient's means of identification to Medicaid. It is hard to imagine when uses would not similarly be covered by, at least, one of the two  other verbs. This risk of superfluity suggests giving § 1028A(a)(1) a more precise reading.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,73,"In sum, § 1028A(a)(1)'s title and text are mutually reinforcing. Both point toward requiring the means of identification to be at the crux of the criminality.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,75,"Section 1028A's list of predicate offenses points to yet another stumbling block for the Government's broad reading. Section 1028A(a)(1) is an enhancement, and a severe one at that. It adds a 2-year mandatory prison sentence onto underlying offenses that do not impose a mandatory prison sentence of any kind. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1035 (false statements relating to health care matters, setting no minimum sentence). This prevents sentencing judges from considering the severity of the offense, even if the amount of money involved was quite small or there are other mitigating factors. Interpretation of § 1028A(a)(1) should thus reflect the distinction between the aggravated identity theft crimes that Congress sought to distinguish for heightened punishment and other crimes. Leocal, 543 U.S. at 11, 125 S.Ct. 377.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,76,"Far from distinguishing, the Government's reading collapses the enhancement into the enhanced. Here, the Government claims that because petitioner's overbilling was facilitated by the patient's Medicaid reimbursement number, § 1028A(a)(1) automatically applies. Patient names or other identifiers will, of course, be involved in the great majority of healthcare billing, whether Medicare for massages, Hong, 938 F.3d at 1051, or for ambulance stretcher services, Medlock, 792 F.3d at 706. Patient names will be on prescriptions, Berroa, 856 F.3d at 148, 155-156, and patients committing fraud on their own behalf will often have to include the names of others on their forms, such as doctors or employers. Under the Government's own reading, such cases are automatically identity theft, Tr. of Oral Arg. 82, independent of whether the name itself had anything to do with the fraudulent aspect of the offense.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,77,"Nor are these implications confined to healthcare. Section 1028A(a)(1)'s predicates include a vast array of offenses, including wire fraud and mail fraud. § 1028A(c)(5). The Government's boundless reading of uses and in relation to would cover facilitating mail fraud by using another person's name to address a letter to them.8 Even beyond that, names or other means of identification are used routinely for billing and payment, whether payment apps, credit and debit cards, a bill sent by mail, or an invoice sent electronically. So long as the criteria for the broad  predicate offenses are met, the Government's reading creates an automatic 2-year sentence for generic overbilling that happens to use ubiquitous payment methods.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,78,"A far more sensible conclusion from the statutory structure is that § 1028A(a)(1)'s enhancement is not indiscriminate, but targets situations where the means of identification itself plays a key role—one that warrants a 2-year mandatory minimum. This points once more to a targeted reading, where the means of identification is at the crux of the underlying criminality, not an ancillary feature of billing.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,80,"If more were needed, a final clue comes from the staggering breadth of the Government's reading. This Court has `traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.' Marinello, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 600, 115 S.Ct. 2357, 132 L.Ed.2d 520 (1995)), see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 703-704, 125 S.Ct. 2129, 161 L.Ed.2d 1008 (2005), McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931). This restraint arises both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of concern that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. Marinello, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1106 (internal quotation marks omitted). After all, crimes are supposed to be defined by the legislature, not by clever prosecutors riffing on equivocal language. Spears, 729 F.3d at 758.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,81,"Time and again, this Court has prudently avoided reading incongruous breadth into opaque language in criminal statutes. In Van Buren v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 1648, 210 L.Ed.2d 26 (2021), the far-reaching consequences of the Government's reading underscored the implausibility of the Government's interpretation. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1661. In Marinello, the Court rejected the Government's reading of a statute about obstructing administration of the Tax Code that would have swept in the person who pays a babysitter $41 per week in cash without withholding taxes, as well as someone who leaves a large cash tip in a restaurant, fails to keep donation receipts from every charity to which he or she contributes, or fails to provide every record to an accountant. 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1108. Nor was all such conduct innocent, as the statute required an individual to act `corruptly.' Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1108. Even still, had Congress intended to sweep so far, it would have spoken with more clarity than it did. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1108. In Yates, the Court held that the Government's unrestrained reading would have turned a provision focused on records and documents into an all-encompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence that would sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind, including a fish. 574 U.S. at 536, 540, 135 S.Ct. 1074 (plurality opinion). Had Congress set out to do so, one would have expected a clearer indication of that intent. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,82,"So too here. The Government's reading would sweep in the hour-inflating lawyer, the steak-switching waiter, the building contractor who tacks an extra $10 onto the price of the paint he purchased. So long as they used various common billing methods, they would all be subject to a mandatory two years in federal prison. To say that such a result is implausible would be an  understatement.9 Because everyday overbilling cases would account for the majority of violations in practice, the Government's reading places at the core of the statute its most improbable applications.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,83,"Finally, the Government makes a familiar plea: There is no reason to mistrust its sweeping reading, because prosecutors will act responsibly. To this, the Court gives a just-as-familiar response: We cannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption that the Government will `use it responsibly.' McDonnell, 579 U.S. at 576, 136 S.Ct. 2355 (quoting United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 480, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010)). To rely upon prosecutorial discretion to narrow the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute's highly abstract general statutory language places great power in the hands of the prosecutor. Marinello, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1108. This concern is particularly salient here. If § 1028A(a)(1) applies virtually automatically to a swath of predicate offenses, the prosecutor can hold the threat of charging an additional 2-year mandatory prison sentence over the head of any defendant who is considering going to trial.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,85,"All the points above are different wells drawing from the same source. The Court need not decide whether any of these points, standing alone, would be dispositive. Taken together, from text to context, from content to common sense, § 1028A(a)(1) is not amenable to the Government's attempt to push the statutory envelope. A defendant uses another person's means of identification in relation to a predicate offense when this use is at the crux of what makes the conduct criminal. To be clear, being at the crux of the criminality requires more than a causal relationship, such as `facilitation' of the offense or being a but-for cause of its success. Post, at 1575, 1576-1577 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment). Instead, with fraud or deceit crimes like the one in this case, the means of identification specifically must be used in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive. Such fraud or deceit going to identity can often be succinctly summarized as going to who is involved.10",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,86,"Here, petitioner's use of the patient's name was not at the crux of what  made the underlying overbilling fraudulent. The crux of the healthcare fraud was a misrepresentation about the qualifications of petitioner's employee. The patient's name was an ancillary feature of the billing method employed. The Sixth Circuit's more colloquial formulation is a helpful guide, though like any rule of thumb it will have its limits. Here, however, it neatly captures the thrust of the analysis, as petitioner's fraud was in misrepresenting how and when services were provided to a patient, not who received the services.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2022-037,87,"Because petitioner did not use the patient's means of identification in relation to a predicate offense within the meaning of § 1028A(a)(1), the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Sotomayor,0,

2022-037,90,"Whoever among you is not an aggravated identity thief, let him cast the first stone. The United States came to this Court with a view of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1) that would affix that unfortunate label on almost every adult American. Every bill splitter who has overcharged a friend using a mobile-payment service like Venmo. Every contractor who has rounded up his billed time by even a few minutes. Every college hopeful who has overstated his involvement in the high school glee club. All of those individuals, the United States says, engage in conduct that can invite a mandatory 2-year stint in federal prison. The Court today rightly rejects that unserious position. But in so holding, I worry the Court has stumbled upon a more fundamental problem with § 1028A(a)(1). That provision is not much better than a Rorschach test. Depending on how you squint your eyes, you can stretch (or shrink) its meaning to convict (or exonerate) just about anyone. Doubtless, creative prosecutors and receptive judges can do the same. Truly, the statute fails to provide even rudimentary notice of what it does and does not criminalize. We have a term for laws like that. We call them vague. And in our constitutional order, a vague law is no law at all. United States v. Davis, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2319, 2323, 204 L.Ed.2d 757 (2019).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,91,"The aggravated identity theft statute stipulates that whoever, during and in relation to any felony violation listed in a later subsection, knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years. § 1028A(a)(1). Today, the Court sets out to determine what conduct that law reaches. It is, as the Court acknowledges, no easy task. Both the term use and the phrase in relation to can support a multitude of possible meanings. Ante, at 1565-1566. They of course `imply action and implementation.' Ante, at 1565 (quoting Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995)). Beyond that general concept, however, we must fend for ourselves based only on limited contextual clues. Ante, at 1565-1566.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,92,"The United States offers up a rapacious interpretation that would require only the use of the means of identification to `facilitate or further' the predicate offense in some way. Brief for United States 10 (emphasis added). Admittedly, this reading falls within the range of plausible meanings the statute could support. Ante, at 1566. But so too do other readings—ones that require a more demanding nexus between the means of identification and the underlying misconduct.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,93,"Ante, at 1566-1567. For many of the reasons the Court gives (and more besides), I agree that we must adhere to those more restrained offerings. The United States' maximalist approach has simplicity on its side, yes, an everybody-is-guilty standard is no challenge to administer. But the Constitution prohibits the Judiciary from resolving reasonable doubts about a criminal statute's meaning by rounding up to the most punitive interpretation its text and context can tolerate. See Wooden v. United States, 595 U. S. ___, ___ _ ___, 142 S.Ct. 1063, 1081-1084, 212 L.Ed.2d 187 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment). That insight alone means Mr. Dubin's § 1028A(a)(1) conviction cannot stand.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,94,"Unfortunately, our opinion cannot end there. Having told lower courts how not to read the statute, we owe them some guidance as to how they should read it. That is where the real challenge begins. Drawing on contextual clues and rules of statutory interpretation, the Court concludes that a violation of § 1028A(a)(1) occurs whenever the use of the means of identification is at the crux of the underlying criminality. Ante, at 1568 (emphasis added). In other words, the means of identification specifically must be in some way a key mover in the criminality. Ibid. (emphasis added). Put still another way, the means of identification must play the (or maybe a) central role in the commission of the offense. Ibid. (emphasis added).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,95,"Setting aside some definite-article inconsistency, those formulations all sound sensible enough. On closer review, however, they present intractable interpretive challenges of their own. When, exactly, is a means of identification at the crux, a key mover, or a central role player in an offense? No doubt, the answer turns on causation, or at least causation often helps to answer the question. United States v. Michael, 882 F.3d 624, 628 (C.A.6 2018). The Court agrees but stresses that a causal relationship of any kind will not suffice. Ante, at 1573. At the same time, however, it studiously avoids indicating whether the appropriate standard is proximate cause or something else entirely novel. Ibid. All of which gives rise to further questions. In virtually every fraud, a means of identification plays some critical role in the fraud's success—good luck committing a mail or wire fraud, for instance, without relying heavily on the name of the victim and likely the names of other third parties. Just how much causation must a prosecutor establish to sustain a § 1028A(a)(1) conviction? For that matter, how does one even determine the extent to which a means of identification caused an offense, as compared to the many other necessary inputs?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,96,"The Court supplies no firm answer. Instead, it leans on various illustrations that only highlight the difficulties inherent in this exercise. Take, for instance, the Court's assurance that a waiter who serves flank steak but charges for filet mignon using an electronic payment method has not committed aggravated identity theft. Ante, at 1563, 1568-1569. Why not, exactly? In one sense, the means of identification (the credit card) lies at the crux of the fraud. The restaurant uses it to charge the customer for a product it never supplied. Maybe that feels less distasteful than a scenario in which an overseas hacker steals an individual's credit card information and deploys it to order luxury goods on Amazon. But the Constitution's promise of due process means that criminal statutes must provide rules knowable in advance, not intuitions discoverable only after a prosecutor has issued an indictment and a judge offers an opinion. Percoco v. United States, 598 U. S. ___, ___, 143 S.Ct. 1130, 1142, ___  L.Ed.2d ___ (2023) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,97,"Not yet convinced? Consider some tweaks to the Court's hypothetical. Suppose that, instead of misrepresenting the cut of its steaks, a restaurant charged a customer for an appetizer he ordered that never arrived. What about an appetizer he never ordered? An additional entrée? Three? Three plus a $5,000 bottle of Moët? How about a Boeing 737? Now suppose the restaurant ran the customer's credit card for the same steak twice. What if it waited an hour to do so? A day? A year? What if the waiter gave the credit card information to a different employee at the same restaurant to run the charge? A different employee at a different restaurant? What if the restaurant sold the customer's credit card information on the dark web, and another restaurant ran the card for filet mignon? On the Court's telling, the crux of the fraud in some of these examples lies merely in how and when services were provided, while in others the crux involves who received the services. Ante, at 1574. But how to tell which is which?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,98,"The Court's crux test seemingly offers no sure way through this blizzard of  hypotheticals. Ibid., n. 10. Nor is that because I have cherry-picked hard cases. Ibid. Scenarios like these—and variations of them—illustrate the sorts of problems that invariably arise in even simple § 1028A(a)(1) cases involving bogus restaurant bills. Other contexts can present still greater complications and still deeper uncertainties. The problem we face, then, is not that § 1028A(a)(1) presents some hard cases at its edges, the problem is this statute has no easy cases. Really, you could spend a whole day cooking up scenarios —ranging from the mundane to the fanciful—that collapse even your most basic intuitions about what § 1028A(a)(1) does and does not criminalize. Try making up some of your own and running them by a friend or family member. You may be surprised at how sharply instincts diverge.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,99,"For the less adventurous, consider just the facts of the case now before us. On one framing, it seems outrageous to convict Mr. Dubin of aggravated identity theft. After all, the patient did (at one point) receive psychological testing. So you might say, as the Court does, that Mr. Dubin lied only about the qualifications of the individual who provided those services and the date on which they occurred. See ante, at 1563, 1573-1574. But on another framing, the patient's identity was a key mover, perhaps even at the crux, of the fraud. Mr. Dubin could not have successfully billed the insurance provider without accurately offering up some specific patient's name and information. Nor, as the United States notes, could Mr. Dubin have simply drawn a random name from a hat. Rather, his fraud depended on purloining the specific identity of a Texas Medicaid enrollee who had at least three hours of psychological-testing reimbursement left in his or her account. Brief for United States 13. Along the way, Mr. Dubin's fraud directly harmed the patient by depriving him of his annual eligibility for otherwise-compensable psychological services. From the patient's perspective, Mr. Dubin's use of his means of identification could hardly feel ancillary. Ante, at 1563.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,100,"As an abstract exercise, debating fact patterns like these may seem good fun. But there is nothing entertaining about a 2-year mandatory federal prison sentence. Criminal statutes are not games to be played in the car on a cross-country road trip. To satisfy the constitutional minimum of due process, they must at least provide ordinary people with fair notice of the conduct they punish. Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 595, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). And, respectfully, I do not see how § 1028A(a)(1) can clear that threshold. Under the  Court's crux test, no boundary separates conduct that gives rise to liability from conduct that does not. And it appears I share this concern with the very lower court judges who will have to apply this standard prospectively. As even many of the Fifth Circuit dissenters below warned, the sort of facilitation standard the Court today adopts, with its incidental/integral dividing line, is unworkable because it lacks clear lines and a limiting principle. 27 F.4th 1021, 1042 (2022) (en banc) (COSTA, J., dissenting). In the end, it is hard not to worry that the Court's crux test will simply become a fig leaf for judges' and jurors' own subjective moral judgments about whether (as the Court itself puts it) the defendant's crime is one that warrants a 2-year mandatory minimum. Ante, at 1572.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,101,"I do not question that the Court today has done the best it might to make sense of this statute. It's just that it faces an impossible task. In the past when this Court has grappled with similar statutory language, it has done so in contexts where the relevant terms could carry only a few possible (and comparatively fixed) meanings. For example, when it comes to the use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), the presence of a gun could be a but-for cause of (or a necessary ingredient of) the offense —used, for example, as compensation in an exchange for illicit drugs. Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 237-238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). Or the gun could be `used as a weapon' by being discharged or brandished. Id., at 243, 113 S.Ct., 2050 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because both those interpretations are relatively bounded and understandable, this Court could use principles of statutory interpretation to choose between them. The same holds true for many of the other statutes the Court (mistakenly) frets I would call into doubt. See ante, at 1573, n. 10.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-037,102,"The same cannot be said for § 1028A(a)(1), though. There are an uncountable number of ways in which an individual could use the means of identification of another to commit fraud.

And no obvious neutral rule exists to separate those uses that violate § 1028A(a)(1) from others that do not. In this way, § 1028A(a)(1) is not just an ambiguous statute—one that does define prohibited conduct with some precision, but that is subject to two or more different interpretations. J.

By its terms, the Secretary may waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Education Act as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency. 20 U.S.C. § 1098bb(a)(1).1",Roberts,0,

An affected individual is defined, in relevant part, as someone who resides or is employed in an area that is declared a disaster area by any Federal, State, or local official in connection with a national emergency or who suffered direct economic hardship as a direct result of a war or other military operation or national emergency, as determined by the Secretary. §§ 1098ee(2)(C)-(D).

One week later, then-Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced that she was suspending loan repayments and interest accrual for all federally held student loans. See Dept. of Ed., Breaking News: Testing Waivers and Student Loan Relief (Mar. 20, 2020). The following week, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which required the Secretary to extend the suspensions through the end of September 2020. 134 Stat. 404-405.

See App. 257-259, Washington Post, Sept. 20, 2022, p. A3, col. 1.

The legal definition is no different. Black's Law Dictionary 1203 (11th ed. 2019) (giving the  first definition of modify as to make somewhat different, to make small changes to, and the second as to make more moderate or less sweeping).

2022-038,67,"The Secretary's previous invocations of the HEROES Act illustrate this point. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, modifications issued under the Act implemented only minor changes, most of which were procedural.

See Dept. of Ed., White House Fact Sheet: The Biden Administration's Plan for Student Debt Relief Could Benefit Tens of Millions of Borrowers in All Fifty States (Sept. 20, 2022). From a few narrowly delineated situations specified by Congress, the Secretary has expanded forgiveness to nearly every borrower in the country.",Roberts,0,

2022-038,71,"The Secretary responds that the Act authorizes him to waive legal provisions as well as modify them—and that this additional term grants broader authority than would modify alone. But the Secretary's invocation of the waiver power here does not remotely resemble how it has been used on prior occasions. Previously, waiver under the HEROES Act was straightforward: the Secretary identified a particular legal requirement and waived it, making compliance no longer necessary. For instance, on one occasion the Secretary waived the requirement that a student provide a written request for a leave of absence. See 77 Fed. Reg. 59314. On another, he waived the regulatory provisions requiring schools and guaranty agencies to attempt collection of defaulted loans for the time period in which students were affected individuals. See 68 Fed. Reg. 69316.",Roberts,0,
2022-038,72,"Here, the Secretary does not identify any provision that he is actually waiving.4 No specific provision of the Education Act establishes an obligation on the part of student borrowers to pay back the Government. So as the Government concedes, waiver—as used in the HEROES Act— cannot refer to waiving loan balances or waiving the obligation to repay on the part of a borrower. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, 64. Contrast 20 U.S.C. § 1091b(b)(2)(D) (allowing the Secretary to waive the amounts that students are required to return in specified circumstances of overpayment by the Government). Because the Secretary cannot waive a particular provision or provisions to achieve the desired result, he is forced to take a more circuitous approach, one that avoids any need to show compliance with the statutory limitation on his authority. He simply waives the elements of the discharge and cancellation provisions that are inapplicable in this debt cancellation program that would limit eligibility to other contexts. Tr. of Oral Arg. 64-65.",Roberts,0,
2022-038,73,"Yet even that expansive conception of waiver cannot justify the Secretary's plan, which does far more than relax existing legal requirements. The plan specifies particular sums to be forgiven and income-based eligibility requirements. The addition of these new and substantially different provisions cannot be said to be a waiver of the old in any meaningful sense. Recognizing this, the Secretary acknowledges that waiver alone is not enough, after waiving whatever inapplicable law would bar his debt cancellation plan, he says, he then modified the provisions to bring them in line with this program. Id., at 65. So in the end, the Secretary's plan relies on modifications all the way down. And as we have explained, the word modify simply cannot bear that load.",Roberts,0,
2022-038,74,"The Secretary and the dissent go on to argue that the power to waive or modify is greater than the sum of its parts. Because waiver allows the Secretary to eliminate legal obligations in their entirety, the argument runs, the combination of waive or modify allows him to reduce them to any extent short of waiver—even if the power to modify ordinarily does not stretch that far. Reply Brief 16-17 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the Secretary's program cannot be justified by such sleight of hand. The Secretary  has not truly waived or modified the provisions in the Education Act authorizing specific and limited forgiveness of student loans. Those provisions remain safely intact in the U. S. Code, where they continue to operate in full force. What the Secretary has actually done is draft a new section of the Education Act from scratch by waiving provisions root and branch and then filling the empty space with radically new text.",Roberts,0,
2022-038,75,"Lastly, the Secretary points to a procedural provision in the HEROES Act. The Act directs the Secretary to publish a notice in the Federal Register including the terms and conditions to be applied in lieu of such statutory and regulatory provisions as the Secretary has waived or modified. 20 U.S.C. § 1098bb(b)(2) (emphasis added). In the Secretary's view, that language authorizes both deleting and then adding back in, waiving and then putting his own requirements in—a sort of red penciling of the existing law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 65, see also Reply Brief 17.",Roberts,0,
2022-038,76,"Section 1098bb(b)(2) is, however, a wafer-thin reed on which to rest such sweeping power. Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2485, 2489, 210 L.Ed.2d 856 (2021) (per curiam). The provision is no more than it appears to be: a humdrum reporting requirement. Rather than implicitly granting the Secretary authority to draft new substantive statutory provisions at will, it simply imposes the obligation to report any waivers and modifications he has made. Section 1098bb(b)(2) suggests that waivers and modifications includes additions. The dissent accordingly reads the statute as authorizing any degree of change or any new addition, from modest to substantial—and nothing in the dissent's analysis suggests stopping at substantial. Post, at 2395. Because the Secretary does not have to leave gaping holes when he waives provisions, the argument runs, it follows that any replacement terms the Secretary uses to fill those holes must be lawful. Ibid. But the Secretary's ability to add new terms in lieu of the old is limited to his authority to modify existing law. As with any other modification issued under the Act, no new term or condition reported pursuant to § 1098bb(b)(2) may distort the fundamental nature of the provision it alters.5",Roberts,0,
2022-038,77,"The Secretary's comprehensive debt cancellation plan cannot fairly be called a waiver—it not only nullifies existing provisions, but augments and expands them dramatically. It cannot be mere modification, because it constitutes effectively the introduction of a whole new regime. MCI, 512 U.S. at 234, 114 S.Ct. 2223. And it cannot be some combination of the two, because when the Secretary seeks to addto existing law, the fact that he has waived certain provisions does not give him a free pass to avoid the limits inherent in the power to modify. However broad the meaning of waive or modify, that language cannot authorize the kind of exhaustive rewriting of the statute that has taken place here.6  B",Roberts,0,
2022-038,78,"In a final bid to elide the statutory text, the Secretary appeals to congressional purpose. The whole point of the HEROES Act, the Government contends, is to ensure that in the face of a national emergency that is causing financial harm to borrowers, the Secretary can do something.

As we have already noted, past waivers and modifications issued under the Act have been extremely modest and narrow in scope. The Act has been used only once before to waive or modify a provision related to debt cancellation: In 2003, the Secretary waived the requirement that borrowers seeking loan forgiveness under the Education Act's public service discharge provisions perform uninterrupted, otherwise qualifying service for a specified length of time (for example, one year) or for consecutive periods of time, such as 5 consecutive years. 68 Fed.

But in light of the sweeping and unprecedented impact of the Secretary's loan forgiveness program, it would seem more accurate to describe the program as being in the wheelhouse of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.

It would be odd to think that separation of powers concerns evaporate simply because the Government is providing monetary benefits rather than imposing obligations.

Rather, I understand it to emphasize the importance of context when a court interprets a delegation to an administrative agency. Seen in this light, the major questions doctrine is a tool for discerning—not departing from—the text's most natural interpretation.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,100,"Substantive canons are rules of construction that advance values external to a statute.1 A. Barrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B. U. L. Rev. 109, 117 (2010) (Barrett). Some substantive canons, like the rule of lenity, play the modest role of breaking a tie between equally plausible interpretations of a statute. United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 514, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) (plurality opinion). Others are more aggressive —think of them as strong-form substantive canons. Unlike a tie-breaking rule, a strong-form canon counsels a court to strain statutory text to advance a particular value. Barrett 168. There are many such canons on the books, including constitutional avoidance, the clear-statement federalism rules, and the presumption against retroactivity. Id., at 138-145, 172-173. Such rules effectively impose a clarity  tax on Congress by demanding that it speak unequivocally if it wants to accomplish certain ends. J. Manning, Clear Statement Rules and the Constitution, 110 Colum. L. Rev. 399, 403 (2010). This clear statement requirement means that the better interpretation of a statute will not necessarily prevail. E.g., Boechler v. Commissioner, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1493, 1499, 212 L.Ed.2d 524 (2022) (In this context, better is not enough). Instead, if the better reading leads to a disfavored result (like provoking a serious constitutional question), the court will adopt an inferior-but-tenable reading to avoid it. So to achieve an end protected by a strong-form canon, Congress must close all plausible off ramps.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,101,"While many strong-form canons have a long historical pedigree, they are in significant tension with textualism insofar as they instruct a court to adopt something other than the statute's most natural meaning. Barrett 123-124. The usual textualist enterprise involves hearing the words as they would sound in the mind of a skilled, objectively reasonable user of words. F. Easterbrook, The Role of Original Intent in Statutory Construction, 11 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 59, 65 (1988). But a strong-form canon loads the dice for or against a particular result in order to serve a value that the judiciary has chosen to specially protect. A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 27 (1997) (Scalia), see also Barrett 124, 168-169. Even if the judiciary's adoption of such canons can be reconciled with the Constitution,2 it is undeniable that they pose a lot of trouble for the honest textualist. Scalia 28.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,103,"Some have characterized the major questions doctrine as a strong-form substantive canon designed to enforce Article I's Vesting Clause. See, e.g., C. Sunstein, There Are Two Major Questions Doctrines, 73 Admin. L. Rev. 475, 483-484 (2021) (asserting that recent cases apply the major questions doctrine as a nondelegation canon), L. Heinzerling, The Power Canons, 58 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1933, 1946-1948 (2017) (describing the major questions doctrine as a normative canon that is both a presumption against certain kinds of agency interpretations and an instruction to Congress). On this view, the Court overprotects the nondelegation principle by increasing the cost of delegating authority to agencies—namely, by requiring Congress to speak unequivocally in order to grant them significant rule-making power. See Barrett 172-176, see also post, at 2399 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (describing the major questions doctrine as a heightened-specificity requirement), Georgia v. President of the United States, 46 F.4th 1283, 1314 (CA11 2022) (Anderson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (The major questions doctrine is essentially a clear-statement rule). This clarity tax might prevent  Congress from getting too close to the nondelegation line, especially since the intelligible principle test largely leaves Congress to self-police. (So the doctrine would function like constitutional avoidance.) In addition or instead, the doctrine might reflect the judgment that it is so important for Congress to exercise all legislative Powers, Art. I, § 1, that it should be forced to think twice before delegating substantial discretion to agencies—even if the delegation is well within Congress's power to make. (So the doctrine would function like the rule that Congress must speak clearly to abrogate state sovereign immunity.) No matter which rationale justifies it, this clear statement version of the major questions doctrine loads the dice so that a plausible antidelegation interpretation wins even if the agency's interpretation is better.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,104,"While one could walk away from our major questions cases with this impression, I do not read them this way. No doubt, many of our cases express an expectation of clear congressional authorization to support sweeping agency action. See, e.g., West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2609, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427, 189 L.Ed.2d 372 (2014), see also Alabama Assn. of Realtors v.

And none purports to depart from the best interpretation of the text—the hallmark of a true clear-statement rule.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,105,"So what work is the major questions doctrine doing in these cases? I will give you the long answer, but here is the short one: The doctrine serves as an interpretive tool reflecting common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency. FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000).",Barrett,0,
2022-038,107,"The major questions doctrine situates text in context, which is how textualists, like all interpreters, approach the task at hand. C. Nelson, What Is Textualism? 91 Va. L. Rev. 347, 348 (2005) (No `textualist' favors isolating statutory language from its surrounding context), Scalia 37 (In textual interpretation, context is everything). After all, the meaning of a word depends on the circumstances in which it is used. J. Manning, The Absurdity Doctrine, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2387, 2457 (2003) (Manning). To strip a word from its context is to strip that word of its meaning.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,108,"Context is not found exclusively `within the four corners' of a statute. Id., at 2456. Background legal conventions, for instance, are part of the statute's context. F. Easterbrook, The Case of the Speluncean Explorers: Revisited, 112 Harv. L. Rev. 1876, 1913 (1999) (Language takes meaning from its linguistic context, as well as historical and governmental contexts). Thus, courts apply a presumption of mens rea to criminal statutes, Xiulu Ruan v. United States, 597 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2370, 2376-77, 213 L.Ed.2d 706 (2022), and a presumption of equitable tolling to statutes of limitations, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). It is also well established that  where Congress employs a term of art obviously transplanted from another legal source, it brings the old soil with it. George v. McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1953, 1959, 213 L.Ed.2d 265 (2022) (internal quotation marks omitted). I could go on. See, e.g., Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014) (federal causes of action are construed to incorporate a requirement of proximate causation), Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue v.

As it happens, the notion that some things `go without saying' applies to legislation just as it does to everyday life. Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014).",Barrett,0,
2022-038,109,"Context also includes common sense, which is another thing that goes without saying. Case reporters and casebooks brim with illustrations of why literalism— the antithesis of context-driven interpretation —falls short. Consider the classic example of a statute imposing criminal penalties on `whoever drew blood in the streets.' United States v. Kirby, 74 U.S. 482, 7 Wall. 482, 487, 19 L.Ed. 278 (1869). Read literally, the statute would cover a surgeon accessing a vein of a person in the street. But common sense counsels otherwise, ibid., because in the context of the criminal code, a reasonable observer would expect the term `drew blood' to describe a violent act, Manning 2461. Common sense similarly bears on judgments like whether a floating home is a vessel, Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 568 U.S. 115, 120-121, 133 S.Ct. 735, 184 L.Ed.2d 604 (2013), whether tomatoes are vegetables, Nix v. Hedden, 149 U.S. 304, 306-307, 13 S.Ct. 881, 37 L.Ed. 745 (1893), and whether a skin irritant is a chemical weapon, Bond, 572 U.S. at 860-862, 134 S.Ct. 2077.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,110,"Why is any of this relevant to the major questions doctrine? Because context is also relevant to interpreting the scope of a delegation. Think about agency law, which is all about delegations. When an agent acts on behalf of a principal, she has actual authority to take action designated or implied in the principal's manifestations to the agent  as the agent reasonably understands those manifestations. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02(1) (2005). Whether an agent's understanding is reasonable depends on the context in which the principal and agent interact, including their prior dealings, industry customs and usages, and the nature of the principal's business or the principal's personal situation. Id., § 2.02, Comment e (emphasis added). With that in mind, imagine that a grocer instructs a clerk to go to the orchard and buy apples for the store. Though this grant of apple-purchasing authority sounds unqualified, a reasonable clerk would know that there are limits. For example, if the grocer usually keeps 200 apples on hand, the clerk does not have actual authority to buy 1,000—the grocer would have spoken more directly if she meant to authorize such an out-of-the-ordinary purchase. A clerk who disregards context and stretches the words to their fullest will not have a job for long.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,111,"This is consistent with how we communicate conversationally. Consider a parent who hires a babysitter to watch her young children over the weekend. As she walks out the door, the parent hands the babysitter her credit card and says: Make sure the kids have fun. Emboldened, the babysitter takes the kids on a road trip to an amusement park, where they spend two days on rollercoasters and one night in a hotel. Was the babysitter's trip consistent with the parent's instruction? Maybe in a literal sense, because the instruction was open-ended. But was the trip consistent with a reasonable understanding of the  parent's instruction? Highly doubtful. In the normal course, permission to spend money on fun authorizes a babysitter to take children to the local ice cream parlor or movie theater, not on a multiday excursion to an out-of-town amusement park. If a parent were willing to greenlight a trip that big, we would expect much more clarity than a general instruction to make sure the kids have fun.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,112,"But what if there is more to the story? Perhaps there is obvious contextual evidence that the babysitter's jaunt was permissible —for example, maybe the parent left tickets to the amusement park on the counter. Other clues, though less obvious, can also demonstrate that the babysitter took a reasonable view of the parent's instruction. Perhaps the parent showed the babysitter where the suitcases are, in the event that she took the children somewhere overnight. Or maybe the parent mentioned that she had budgeted $2,000 for weekend entertainment. Indeed, some relevant points of context may not have been communicated by the parent at all. For instance, we might view the parent's statement differently if this babysitter had taken the children on such trips before or if the babysitter were a grandparent.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,113,"In my view, the major questions doctrine grows out of these same commonsense principles of communication. Just as we would expect a parent to give more than a general instruction if she intended to authorize a babysitter-led getaway, we also expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast `economic and political significance.' Utility Air, 573 U.S., at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. That clarity may come from specific words in the statute, but context can also do the trick. Surrounding circumstances, whether contained within the statutory scheme or external to it, can narrow or broaden the scope of a delegation to an agency.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,114,"This expectation of clarity is rooted in the basic premise that Congress normally intends to make major policy decisions itself, not leave those decisions to agencies. United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 855 F.3d 381, 419 (CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of reh'g en banc). Or, as Justice Breyer once observed, Congress is more likely to have focused upon, and answered, major questions, while leaving interstitial matters for agencies to answer themselves in the course of a statute's daily administration. S. Breyer, Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin. L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986), see also A. Gluck & L. Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside—An Empirical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation, and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, 1003-1006 (2013). That makes eminent sense in light of our constitutional structure, which is itself part of the legal context framing any delegation. Because the Constitution vests Congress with all legislative Powers, Art. I, § 1, a reasonable interpreter would expect it to make the big-time policy calls itself, rather than pawning them off to another branch. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2609 (explaining that the major questions doctrine rests on both separation of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative intent).",Barrett,0,
2022-038,115,"Crucially, treating the Constitution's structure as part of the context in which a delegation occurs is not the same as using a clear-statement rule to overenforce Article I's nondelegation principle (which, again, is the rationale behind the substantive-canon view of the major questions doctrine). My point is simply that in a system of separated powers, a reasonably informed interpreter would expect Congress  to legislate on important subjects while delegating away only the details. Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. 1, 10 Wheat. 1, 43, 6 L.Ed. 253 (1825). That is different from a normative rule that discourages Congress from empowering agencies. To see what I mean, return to the ambitious babysitter. Our expectation of clearer authorization for the amusement-park trip is not about discouraging the parent from giving significant leeway to the babysitter or forcing the parent to think hard before doing so. Instead, it reflects the intuition that the parent is in charge and sets the terms for the babysitter—so if a judgment is significant, we expect the parent to make it. If, by contrast, one parent left the children with the other parent for the weekend, we would view the same trip differently because the parents share authority over the children. In short, the balance of power between those in a relationship inevitably frames our understanding of their communications. And when it comes to the Nation's policy, the Constitution gives Congress the reins—a point of context that no reasonable interpreter could ignore.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,116,"Given these baseline assumptions, an interpreter should typically greet an agency's claim to extravagant statutory power with at least some measure of skepticism. Utility Air, 573 U.S., at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. That skepticism is neither made-up nor new. Post, at 2397, 2399-2400 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). On the contrary, it appears in a line of decisions spanning at least 40 years. E.g., King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485-486, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 192 L.Ed.2d 483 (2015), Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 267-268, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006), Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S., at 159-160, 120 S.Ct. 1291, Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 645, 100 S.Ct. 2844, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980) (plurality opinion).3",Barrett,0,
2022-038,117,"Still, this skepticism does not mean that courts have an obligation (or even permission) to choose an inferior-but-tenable alternative that curbs the agency's authority—and that marks a key difference between my view and the clear statement view of the major questions doctrine. In some cases, the court's initial skepticism might be overcome by text directly authorizing the agency action or context demonstrating that the agency's interpretation is convincing. (And because context can suffice, I disagree with Justice KAGAN's critique that the doctrine forces Congress to delegate in highly specific terms. Post, at 2397.) If so, the court must adopt the agency's reading despite the majorness of the question.4 In other cases, however, the court might conclude that the agency's expansive reading, even if plausible, is not the best. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2609. In that event, the major questions doctrine plays a role, because it helps explain the court's conclusion that the agency overreached.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,118,"Consider Brown & Williamson, in which we rejected the Food and Drug Administration's  (FDA's) determination that tobacco products were within its regulatory purview. 529 U.S., at 131, 120 S.Ct. 1291. The agency's assertion of authority—which depended on the argument that nicotine is a `drug' and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are `drug delivery devices' —would have been plausible if the relevant statutory text were read in a vacuum. Ibid. But a vacuum is no home for a textualist. Instead, we stressed that the meaning of a word or phrase may only become evident when placed in context. Id., at 132, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (emphasis added). And the critical context in Brown & Williamson was tobacco's unique political history: the FDA's longstanding disavowal of authority to regulate it, Congress's creation of a distinct regulatory scheme for tobacco products, and the tobacco industry's significant role in the American economy. Id., at 159-160, 120 S.Ct. 1291. In light of those considerations, we concluded that Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic a fashion. Id., at 160, 120 S.Ct. 1291.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,119,"We have also been skeptical of mismatches between broad invocations of power by agencies and relatively narrow statutes that purport to delegate that power. In re MCP No. 165, OSHA, Interim Final Rule: Covid-19 Vaccination and Testing, 20 F.4th 264, 272 (CA6 2021) (Sutton, C. J., dissenting from denial of initial hearing en banc). Just as an instruction to pick up dessert is not permission to buy a four-tier wedding cake, Congress's use of a subtle device is not authorization for agency action of enormous importance. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231, 114 S.Ct. 2223, 129 L.Ed.2d 182 (1994), cf. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001) (Congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes). This principle explains why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) general authority to `prevent the  spread of communicable diseases' did not authorize a nationwide eviction moratorium. Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594 U. S., at ___ - ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2486-87, 2488-89. The statute, we observed, was a wafer-thin reed that could not support the assertion of such sweeping power. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2489. Likewise, in West Virginia, we held that a little-used backwater provision in the Clean Air Act could not justify an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule that would restructure the Nation's overall mix of electricity generation. 597 U. S., at ___, ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2607, 2613.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,120,"Another telltale sign that an agency may have transgressed its statutory authority is when it regulates outside its wheelhouse. For instance, in Gonzales v. Oregon, we rebuffed an interpretive rule from the Attorney General that restricted the use of controlled substances in physician-assisted suicide. 546 U.S. at 254, 275, 126 S.Ct. 904. This judgment, we explained, was a medical one that lay beyond the Attorney General's expertise, and so a sturdier source of statutory authority than an implicit delegation was required. Id., at 267-268, 126 S.Ct. 904. Likewise, in King v. Burwell, we blocked the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) attempt to decide whether the Affordable Care Act's tax credits could be available on federally established exchanges. 576 U.S. at 485-486, 135 S.Ct. 2480. Among other things, the IRS's lack of expertise in crafting health insurance policy made us think that had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly. Id., at 486, 135 S.Ct. 2480. Echoing the theme, our reasoning in Alabama Association of Realtors rested partly on the fact  that the CDC's eviction moratorium intruded into  the landlord-tenant relationship —hardly the day-in, day-out work of a public-health agency. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2489. National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA is of a piece. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 661, 211 L.Ed.2d 448 (2022) (per curiam). There, we held that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) authority to ensure `safe and healthful working conditions' did not encompass the power to mandate the vaccination of employees, as we explained, the statute empowered the agency to set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures. Id., at ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. at 663, 665. The shared intuition behind these cases is that a reasonable speaker would not understand Congress to confer an unusual form of authority without saying more.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,121,"We have also pumped the brakes when an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate `a significant portion of the American economy.' Utility Air, 573 U.S., at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. Of course, an agency's post-enactment conduct does not control the meaning of a statute, but this Court has long said that courts may consider the consistency of an agency's views when we weigh the persuasiveness of any interpretation it proffers in court. Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 97, 143 S.Ct. 713, 215 L.Ed.2d 1 (2023) (citing Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)). The agency's track record can be particularly probative in this context: A longstanding want of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it may provide some clue that the power was never conferred. FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U.S. 349, 352, 61 S.Ct. 580, 85 L.Ed. 881 (1941). Once again, Brown & Williamson is a good example. There, we balked at the FDA's novel attempt to regulate tobacco in part because this move was contrary to its representations to Congress since 1914. 529 U.S., at 159, 120 S.Ct. 1291. And in Utility Air, we were dubious when the EPA discovered newfound authority in the Clean Air Act that would have allowed it to require greenhouse-gas permits for millions of small sources— including retail stores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches. 573 U.S. at 328, 134 S.Ct. 2427.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,122,"If the major questions doctrine were a substantive canon, then the common thread in these cases would be that we exchanged the most natural reading of a statute for a bearable one more protective of a judicially specified value. Barrett 111. But by my lights, the Court arrived at the most plausible reading of the statute in these cases. To be sure, all of these regulatory assertions had a colorable textual basis. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2609. In each case, we could have put on blinders and confined ourselves to the four corners of the statute, and we might have reached a different outcome. Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 43, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Instead, we took off those blinders, viewed the statute as a whole, ibid., and considered context that would be important to a reasonable observer. With the full picture in view, it became evident in each case that the agency's assertion of highly consequential power went beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2609.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,124,"As for today's case: The Court surely could have hit the send button, post, at 2396 (KAGAN, J., dissenting), after the routine statutory analysis set out in Part  III-A. But it is nothing new for a court to punctuate its conclusion with an additional point, and the major questions doctrine is a good one here. Ante, at 2375 n. 9. It is obviously true that the Secretary's loan cancellation program has vast `economic and political significance.' Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. That matters not because agencies are incapable of making highly consequential decisions, but rather because an initiative of this scope, cost, and political salience is not the type that Congress lightly delegates to an agency. And for the reasons given by the Court, the HEROES Act provides no indication that Congress empowered the Secretary to do anything of the sort. Ante, at 2368-2371, 2375-2376.",Barrett,0,
2022-038,125,"Granted, some context clues from past major questions cases are absent here— for example, this is not a case where the agency is operating entirely outside its usual domain. But the doctrine is not an on-off switch that flips when a critical mass of factors is present—again, it simply reflects common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude. Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S., at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Common sense tells us that as more indicators from our previous major questions cases are present, the less likely it is that Congress would have delegated the power to the agency without saying so more clearly.",Barrett,0,

2022-038,130,"Some 20 years ago, Congress enacted legislation, called the HEROES Act, authorizing the Secretary of Education to provide relief to student-loan borrowers when a national emergency struck. The Secretary's authority was bounded: He could do only what was necessary to alleviate the emergency's impact on affected borrowers' ability to repay their student loans. 20 U.S.C. § 1098bb(a)(2). But within that bounded area, Congress gave discretion to the Secretary. He could waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applying to federal student-loan programs, including provisions relating to loan repayment and forgiveness. And in so doing, he could replace the old provisions with new terms and conditions. §§ 1098bb(a)(1), (b)(2). The Secretary, that is, could give the relief that was needed, in the form he deemed most appropriate, to counteract the effects of a national emergency on borrowers' capacity to repay. That may have been a good idea, or it may have been a bad idea. Either way, it was what Congress said.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,131,"When COVID hit, two Secretaries serving two different Presidents decided to use their HEROES Act authority. The first suspended loan repayments and interest accrual for all federally held student loans. The second continued that policy for a time, and then replaced it with the loan forgiveness plan at issue here, granting most low- and middle-income borrowers up to $10,000 in debt relief. Both relied on the HEROES Act language cited above. In establishing the loan forgiveness plan, the current Secretary scratched the pre-existing conditions for loan discharge, and specified different conditions, opening loan forgiveness to more borrowers. So he waived and modified statutory and regulatory provisions and applied other terms and conditions in their stead. That may have been a good idea, or it may have been a bad idea. Either way, the Secretary did only what Congress had told him he could.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,132,"The Court's first overreach in this case is deciding it at all. Under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff must have standing to challenge a government action. And that requires a personal stake—an injury in fact. We do not allow plaintiffs to bring suit just because they oppose a policy. Neither do we allow plaintiffs to rely on injuries suffered by others. Those rules may sound technical, but they enforce fundamental limits on federal judicial power. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). They keep courts acting like courts. Or stated the other way around, they prevent courts from acting like this Court does today. The plaintiffs in this case are six States that have no personal stake in the Secretary's loan forgiveness plan. They are classic ideological plaintiffs: They think the plan a very bad idea, but they are no worse off because the Secretary differs. In giving those States a forum—in adjudicating their complaint—the Court forgets its proper role. The Court acts as though it is an arbiter of political and policy disputes, rather than of cases and controversies.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,133,"And the Court's role confusion persists when it takes up the merits. For years, this Court has insisted that the way to keep judges' policy views and preferences out of judicial decisionmaking is to hew to a statute's text. The HEROES Act's text settles the legality of the Secretary's loan forgiveness plan. The statute provides the Secretary with broad authority to give emergency relief to student-loan borrowers, including by altering usual discharge rules. What the Secretary did fits comfortably within that delegation. But the Court forbids him to proceed. As in other recent cases, the rules of the game change when Congress enacts broad delegations allowing agencies to take substantial regulatory measures. See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2587, 213 L.Ed.2d 896 (2022). Then, as in this case, the Court reads statutes unnaturally, seeking to cabin their evident scope. And the Court applies heightened-specificity requirements, thwarting Congress's efforts to ensure adequate responses to unforeseen events. The result here is that the Court substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch in making national policy about student-loan forgiveness. Congress authorized the forgiveness plan (among many other actions), the Secretary put it in place, and the President would have been accountable for its success or failure. But this Court today decides that some 40 million Americans will not receive the benefits the plan provides, because (so says the Court) that assistance is too significant. Ante, at 2372-2373. With all respect, I dissent.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,135,"No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of  government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies. Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 37, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). In our system, federal courts do not possess a roving commission to publicly opine on every legal question. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2203, 210 L.Ed.2d 568 (2021). Nor do they exercise general legal oversight of the Legislative and Executive Branches. Ibid. A court may address the legality of a government action only if the person challenging it has standing—which requires that the person have suffered a concrete and particularized injury. Ibid. It is not enough for the plaintiff to assert a generalized grievance about government policy. Gill v. Whitford, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1916, 1929, 201 L.Ed.2d 313 (2018). And critically here, the plaintiff cannot rest its claim on a third party's rights and interests. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The plaintiff needs its own stake—a personal stake—in the outcome of the litigation. TransUnion, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2203. If the plaintiff has no such stake, a court must stop in its tracks. To decide the case is to exceed the permissible boundaries of the judicial role.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,136,"That is what the Court does today. The plaintiffs here are six States: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina. They oppose the Secretary's loan cancellation plan on varied policy and legal grounds. But as everyone agrees, those objections are just general grievances, they do not show the particularized injury needed to bring suit. And the States have no straightforward way of making that showing—of explaining how they are harmed by a plan that reduces individual borrowers' federal student-loan debt. So the States have thrown no fewer than four different theories of injury against the wall, hoping that a court anxious to get to the merits will say that one of them sticks. The most that can be said of the theory the majority selects, proffered solely by Missouri, is that it is less risible than the others. It still contravenes a bedrock principle of standing law—that a plaintiff cannot ride on someone else's injury. Missouri is doing just that in relying on injuries to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA), a legally and financially independent public corporation. And that means the Court, by deciding this case, exercises authority it does not have. It violates the Constitution.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,138,"Missouri's theory of standing, as accepted by the majority, goes as follows. MOHELA is a state-created corporation participating in the student-loan market. As part of that activity, it has contracted with the Department of Education to service federally held loans—essentially, to handle billing and collect payments for the Federal Government. Under that contract, MOHELA receives an administrative fee for each loan serviced. When a loan is canceled, MOHELA will not get a fee, so the Secretary's plan will cost MOHELA money. And if MOHELA is harmed, Missouri must be harmed, because the corporation is a public instrumentality and, as such, part of Missouri's government. Brief for Respondents 16-17, see ante, at 2367.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,139,"Up to the last step, the theory is unexceptionable —except that it points to MOHELA as the proper plaintiff. Financial harm is a classic injury in fact. MOHELA plausibly alleges that it will suffer that harm as a result of the Secretary's plan. So MOHELA can sue the Secretary, as the Government readily concedes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. But not even Missouri,  and not even the majority, claims that MOHELA's revenue loss gets passed through to the State. As further discussed below, MOHELA is financially independent from Missouri—as corporations typically are, the better to insulate their creators from financial loss. See infra, at 2387. So MOHELA's revenue decline—the injury in fact claimed to justify this suit— is not in fact Missouri's. The State's treasury will not be out one penny because of the Secretary's plan. The revenue loss allegedly grounding this case is MOHELA's alone.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,140,"Which leads to an obvious question: Where's MOHELA? The answer is: As far from this suit as it can manage. MOHELA could have brought this suit. It possesses the power under Missouri law to sue and be sued in its own name. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 173.385.1(3) (2016). But MOHELA is not a party here. Nor is it an amicus. Nor is it even a rooting bystander. MOHELA was not involved with the decision of the Missouri Attorney General's Office to file this suit. Letter from Appellees in No. 22-3179 (CA8), p. 3 (Nov. 1, 2022). And MOHELA did not cooperate with the Attorney General's efforts. When the AG wanted documents relating to MOHELA's loan-servicing contract, to aid him in putting forward the State's standing theory, he had to file formal sunshine law demands on the entity. See id., at 3-4. MOHELA had no interest in assisting voluntarily.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,141,"If all that makes you suspect that MOHELA is distinct from the State, you would be right. And that is so as a matter of law and financing alike. Yes, MOHELA is a creature of state statute, a public instrumentality established to serve a public function. § 173.360. But the law sets up MOHELA as a corporation—a so-called body corporate—with a separate legal personality. Ibid., First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 625, 103 S.Ct. 2591, 77 L.Ed.2d 46 (1983) (Bancec). Or said a bit differently, MOHELA is—like the lion's share of corporations, whether public or private—a separate legal entity with distinct legal rights and obligations from those belonging to its creator. Agency for Int'l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int'l Inc., 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2082, 2087, 207 L.Ed.2d 654 (2020). MOHELA, for example, has the power to contract with other entities, which is how it entered into a loan-servicing contract with the Department of Education. See § 173.385.1(15). MOHELA's assets, including the fees gained from that contract, are not part of the revenue of the State and cannot be used for the payment of debt incurred by the State. §§ 173.386, 173.425. On the other side of the ledger, MOHELA's debts are MOHELA's alone, Missouri cannot be liable for them. § 173.410. And as noted earlier, MOHELA has the power to sue and be sued independent of Missouri, so it can both prosecute and defend all its varied interests. § 173.385.1(3), see supra, at 2887. Indeed, before this case, Missouri had never tried to appear in court on MOHELA's behalf. That is no surprise. In the statutory scheme, independence is everywhere: State law created MOHELA, but in so doing set it apart.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,142,"The Missouri Supreme Court itself recognized as much in addressing a near-carbon-copy state instrumentality. MOHEFA (note the one-letter difference) issues bonds to support various health and educational institutions in the State. Like MOHELA, MOHEFA is understood as a public instrumentality serving a public function. Menorah Medical Center v. Health and Ed. Facilities Auth., 584 S.W.2d 73, 76 (Mo. 1979). And like MOHELA, MOHEFA has a board appointed by the Governor and sends annual reports to a state department. See Mo. Rev. Stat.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,143,"§§ 360.020, 360.140 (1978), ante, at 2366 (suggesting those features matter). But the State Supreme Court, when confronted with a claim that MOHEFA's undertakings should be ascribed to the State, could hardly have been more dismissive. The court thought it beyond dispute that MOHEFA is not the State, and that its activities are not state activities. Menorah, 584 S.W.2d at 78. Citing MOHEFA's financial and legal independence, the court explained that similar bodies have been adjudged as `separate entities' from Missouri. Ibid. MOHELA is no different.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,144,"Under our usual standing rules, that separation would matter—indeed, would decide this case. A plaintiff, this Court has held time and again, cannot rest its claim to judicial relief on the legal rights and interests of third parties. Warth, 422 U.S., at 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197. And MOHELA qualifies as such a party, for all the reasons just given. That MOHELA is publicly created makes not a whit of difference: When a government instrumentality is established as a juridical entity distinct and independent from its sovereign, the law—including the law of standing—is supposed to treat it that way. Bancec, 462 U.S., at 626-627, 103 S.Ct., at 2600, see Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. United States Shipping Bd. Emergency Fleet Corporation, 258 U.S. 549, 567, 42 S.Ct. 386, 66 L.Ed. 762 (1922). So this case should have been open-and-shut. Missouri and MOHELA are legally, and also financially, separate entities. Menorah, 584 S.W.2d at 78. MOHELA is fully capable of representing its own interests, and always has done so before. The injury to MOHELA thus does not entitle Missouri—under our normal standing rules—to go to court.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,145,"And those normal rules are more than just rules: They are, as this case shows, guarantors of our constitutional order. The requirement that the proper party—the party actually affected—challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408-409, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 185 L.Ed.2d 264 (2013) (Relaxation of standing rules is directly related to the expansion of judicial power). Without that requirement, courts become forums for the ventilation of public grievances—for settlement of ideological and political disputes. Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). The kind of forum this Court has become today. Is there a person in America who thinks Missouri is here because it is worried about MOHELA's loss of loan-servicing fees? I would like to meet him. Missouri is here because it thinks the Secretary's loan cancellation plan makes for terrible, inequitable, wasteful policy. And so too for Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Carolina. And maybe all of them are right. But that question is not what this Court sits to decide. That question is more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and by the broader public. Allen, 468 U.S. at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315. Our third-party standing rules, like the rest of our standing doctrine, exist to separate powers in that way—to send political issues to political institutions, and retain only legal controversies, brought by plaintiffs who have suffered real legal injury. If MOHELA had brought this suit, we would have had to resolve it, however hot or divisive. But Missouri? In adjudicating Missouri's claim, the majority reaches out to decide a matter it has no business deciding. It blows through a constitutional guardrail intended to keep courts acting like courts.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,147,"The majority does not over-expend itself in defending that action. It recites the  State's assertion that a harm to MOHELA is also a harm to Missouri because the former is the latter's instrumentality. Ante, at 2366. But in doing so, the majority barely addresses MOHELA's separate corporate identity, its financial independence, and its distinct legal rights. In other words, the majority glides swiftly over all the attributes of MOHELA ensuring that its economic losses (1) are not passed on to the State and (2) can be rectified (if there is legal wrong) without the State's help. The majority is left to argue from a couple of prior decisions and a single idea, the latter relating to the State's desire to aid Missouri college students. Ante, at 2366. But the decisions do not stand for what the majority claims. And the idea collides with another core precept of standing law. All in all, the majority's justifications turn standing law from a pillar of a restrained judiciary into nothing more than a lawyer's game. Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 548, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).",Kagan,0,
2022-038,148,"The majority mainly relies on Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368, 74 S.Ct. 109, 98 L.Ed. 80 (1953), but that case shows only that not all public instrumentalities are the same. The Court there held that Arkansas could bring suit on behalf of a state university. But it did so because the school lacked the financial and legal separateness MOHELA has. Arkansas, we observed, owns all the property used by the University. Id., at 370, 74 S.Ct. 109. And the suit, if successful, would have enhanced that property: The litigation sought to stop Texas from interfering with a contract to build a medical facility on campus. For the same reason, the Court found that any injury under the contract to the University is an injury to Arkansas: The State was the principal beneficiary of the contract to improve its own property. Ibid. So Arkansas had the sort of direct financial interest not present here. And there is more: The University, the Court thought, could not sue on its own. See ibid. The majority suggests otherwise, citing a state-court decision holding that corporations usually have the power to bring and defend legal actions. See ante, at 2367-2368. But the Arkansas Court referenced a different state-court decision—one holding that another state school was not authorized to sue and be sued. Allen Eng. Co. v. Kays, 106 Ark. 174, 177, 152 S.W. 992, 993 (1913), see Arkansas, 346 U.S. at 370, and n. 9, 74 S.Ct. 109. That decision led this Court to conclude that Arkansas law treated a suit against the University as a suit against the State. Id., at 370, 74 S.Ct. 109. But if state law had not done so—as it does not in Missouri for MOHELA? See supra, at 2387-2388. The Court made clear that a State cannot stand in for an independent entity. The State, the Court said, must, of course, represent an interest of her own and not merely that of her citizens or corporations. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,149,"The majority's second case—Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995)—is yet further afield. The issue there was whether Amtrak, a public corporation similar to MOHELA, had to comply with the First Amendment. The Court held that it did, labeling Amtrak a state actor for that purpose. On the opposite view, we reasoned, a government could evade the most solemn obligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resorting to the corporate form. Id., at 397, 115 S.Ct. 961, see ibid. (noting that Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896) could then be resurrected by the simple device of creating a public corporation to run trains). But that did not mean Amtrak was equivalent to the Government for all purposes. Over and over, we cabined our holding that Amtrak  was a state actor by adding a phrase like for purposes of the First Amendment or other constitutional rights. Id., at 400, 115 S.Ct. 961, see id., at 383, 115 S.Ct. 961 (Amtrak must be regarded as a Government entity for First Amendment purposes), id., at 392, 115 S.Ct. 961 (Amtrak is a Government entity for purposes of determining the constitutional rights of citizens), id., at 394, 115 S.Ct. 961 (Amtrak is an instrumentality of the United States for the purpose of individual rights guaranteed against the Government), id., at 397, 399, 400, 115 S.Ct. 961 (similar, similar, and similar). But for other purposes, a different rule might, or would, obtain. Our holding, we said, did not mean Amtrak had sovereign immunity. See id., at 392, 115 S.Ct. 961. And most relevant here, we reaffirmed that the State does not, by becoming a corporator, identify itself with the corporation for purposes of litigation. Id., at 398, 115 S.Ct. 961. Or said again, the Government is not a party to suits brought by or against its corporation. Id., at 399, 115 S.Ct. 961. So what Lebron tells us about MOHELA is that it must comply with the Constitution. Lebronoffers no support (more like the opposite) for the different view that MOHELA and Missouri are interchangeable parties in litigation.1",Kagan,0,
2022-038,150,"Remaining is the majority's unsupported —and insupportable—idea that the Secretary's plan necessarily hurts Missouri because it impairs MOHELA's efforts to aid the State's college students. Ante, at 2366. To begin with, it seems unlikely that the reduction in MOHELA's revenues resulting from the discharge would make it harder for students to access student loans, as the majority contends. Ante, at 2365-2366. MOHELA is not a lender, it services loans others have made. Which is probably why even Missouri has never tried to show that the Secretary's plan will so detrimentally affect the State's borrowers. In any event—and more important— such a harm to citizens cannot provide an escape hatch out of MOHELA's legal and financial independence. That is because of another canonical limit on a State's ability to ride on third parties: A State may never sue the Federal Government based on its citizens' rights and interests. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 610, n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 3260, 73 L.Ed.2d 995 (1982), Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. ___, ___, and n. 11, 143 S.Ct. 1609, 1674, and n.11, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023). Or said more technically, a State does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal Government. Ibid., see Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485-486, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). So Missouri cannot get standing by asserting that  a harm to MOHELA will harm the State's citizens. Missouri needs to show that the harm to MOHELA produces harm to the State itself. And because, as explained above, MOHELA was set up (as corporations typically are) to insulate its creator from such derivative harm, Missouri is incapable of making that showing. See supra, at 2387. The separateness, both financial and legal, between MOHELA and Missouri makes MOHELA alone the proper party.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,151,"The author of today's opinion once wrote that a 1970s-era standing decision became emblematic of how utterly manipulable this Court's standing law is if not taken seriously as a matter of judicial self-restraint. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 548, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). After today, no one will have to go back 50 years for the classic case of the Court manipulating standing doctrine, rather than obeying the edict to stay in its lane. The majority and I differ, as I'll soon address, on whether the Executive Branch exceeded its authority in issuing the loan cancellation plan. But assuming the Executive Branch did so, that does not license this Court to exceed its own role. Courts must still function as courts, this one no less than others. Ibid. And in our system, that means refusing to decide cases that are not really cases because the plaintiffs have not suffered concrete injuries. The Court ignores that principle in allowing Missouri to piggy-back on the legal rights and interests of an independent entity. Warth, 422 U.S., at 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197. If MOHELA wanted to, it could have brought this suit. It declined to do so. Under the non-manipulable, serious version of standing law, that would have been the end of the matter—regardless how much Missouri, or this Court, objects to the Secretary's plan.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,153,"The majority finds no firmer ground when it reaches the merits. The statute Congress enacted gives the Secretary broad authority to respond to national emergencies. That authority kicks in only under exceptional conditions. But when it kicks in, the Secretary can take exceptional measures. He can waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applying to the student-loan program. § 1098bb(a)(1). And as part of that power, he can apply new terms and conditions in lieu of the former ones. § 1098bb(b)(2). That means when an emergency strikes, the Secretary can alter, so as to cover more people, pre-existing provisions enabling loan discharges. Which is exactly what the Secretary did in establishing his loan forgiveness plan. The majority's contrary conclusion rests first on stilted textual analysis. The majority picks the statute apart piece by piece in an attempt to escape the meaning of the whole. But the whole—the expansive delegation —is so apparent that the majority has no choice but to justify its holding on extra-statutory grounds. So the majority resorts, as is becoming the norm, to its so-called major-questions doctrine. And the majority again reveals that doctrine for what it is—a way for this Court to negate broad delegations Congress has approved, because they will have significant regulatory impacts. Thus the Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch—and the hundreds of millions of people they represent—in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,155,"A bit of background first, to give a sense of where the HEROES Act came from. In 1991 and again in 2002, Congress authorized the Secretary to grant student-loan relief to borrowers affected by a specified  war or emergency. The first statute came out of the Persian Gulf Conflict. It gave the Secretary power to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision relating to student-loan programs in order to assist the men and women serving on active duty in connection with Operation Desert Storm. §§ 372(a)(1), (b), 105 Stat. 93. The next iteration responded to the impacts of the September 11 terrorist attacks. It too gave the Secretary power to waive or modify any student-loan provision, but this time to help borrowers affected by the national emergency created by September 11. § 2(a)(1), 115 Stat. 2386.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,156,"With those one-off statutes in its short-term memory, Congress decided there was a need for a broader and more durable emergency authorization. So in 2003, it passed the HEROES Act. Instead of specifying a particular crisis, that statute enables the Secretary to act as he deems necessary in connection with any military operation or national emergency. § 1098bb(a)(1). But the statute's greater coverage came with no sacrifice of potency. When the law's emergency conditions are satisfied, the Secretary again has the power to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision relating to federal student-loan programs. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,157,"Before turning to the scope of that power, note the stringency of the triggering conditions. Putting aside military applications, the Secretary can act only when the President has declared a national emergency. See § 1098ee(4). Further, the Secretary may provide benefits only to affected individuals—defined as anyone who resides or is employed in an area that is declared a disaster area  in connection with a national emergency or who has suffered direct economic hardship as a direct result of a  national emergency. §§ 1098ee(2)(C)-(D). And the Secretary can do only what he determines to be necessary to ensure that those individuals are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to their loans because of the emergency. § 1098bb(a)(2). That last condition, said more simply, requires the Secretary to show that the relief he awards does not go beyond alleviating the economic effects of an emergency on affected borrowers' ability to repay their loans.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,158,"But if those conditions are met, the Secretary's delegated authority is capacious. As in the prior statutes, the Secretary has the linked power to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applying to the student-loan programs. § 1098bb(a)(1). To start with the phrase after the verbs, the word `any' has an expansive meaning. United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997). Any of the referenced provisions means, well, any of those provisions. And those provisions include several relating to student-loan cancellation —more precisely, specifying conditions in which the Secretary can discharge loan principal. See §§ 1087, 1087dd(g), 34 C.F.R. §§ 682.402, 685.212 (2022). Now go back to the twin verbs: waive or modify. To waive means to abandon, renounce, or surrender—so here, to eliminate a regulatory requirement or condition. Black's Law Dictionary 1894 (11th ed. 2019). To modify means to make somewhat different or to reduce in degree or extent —so here, to lessen rather than eliminate such a requirement. Id., at 1203. Then put the words together, as they appear in the statute: To waive or modify a requirement means to lessen its effect, from the slightest adjustment up to eliminating it altogether. Of course, making such changes may leave gaps to fill. So the statute says what is anyway obvious: that the Secretary's waiver/modification power includes the ability to specify the terms  and conditions to be applied in lieu of such modified or waived statutory and regulatory provisions. § 1098bb(b)(2). Finally, attach the waive or modify power to all the provisions relating to loan cancellation: The Secretary may amend, all the way up to discarding, those provisions and fill the holes that action creates with new terms designed to counteract an emergency's effects on borrowers.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,159,"Before reviewing how that statutory scheme operated here, consider how it might work for a hypothetical emergency that the enacting Congress had in the front of its mind. As noted above, a precursor to the HEROES Act was a statute authorizing the Secretary to assist student-loan borrowers affected by September 11. See supra, at 2391-2392. The HEROES Act, as Congress designed it, would give him the identical power to address similar terrorist attacks in the future. So imagine the horrific. A terrorist organization sets off a dirty bomb in Chicago. Beyond causing deaths, the incident leads millions of residents (including many with student loans) to flee the city to escape the radiation. They must find new housing, probably new jobs. And still their student-loan bills are coming due every month. To prevent widespread loan delinquencies and defaults, the Secretary wants to discharge $10,000 for the class of affected borrowers. Is that legal? Of course it is, it is exactly what Congress provided for. The statutory preconditions are met: The President has declared a national emergency, the Secretary's proposed relief extends only to affected individuals, and the Secretary has deemed the action necessary to ensure that the attack does not place those borrowers in a worse position to repay their loans. § 1098bb(a). And the statutory powers of waiver and modification give the Secretary the means to offer the needed assistance. He can, for purposes of this special loan forgiveness program, scratch the pre-existing conditions for discharge and specify different conditions met by the affected borrowers. That is what the congressionally delegated powers are for. If the Secretary did not use them, Congress would be appalled.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,160,"The HEROES Act applies to the COVID loan forgiveness program in just the same way. Of course, Congress did not know COVID was coming, and maybe it wasn't even thinking about pandemics generally. But that is immaterial, because Congress delegated broadly, for all national emergencies. It is true, too, that the Secretary's use of the HEROES Act delegation has proved politically controversial, in a way that assistance to terrorism victims presumably would not. But again, that fact is irrelevant to the lawfulness of the program. If the hypothetical plan just discussed is legal, so too is this real one. Once more, the statutory preconditions have been met. The President declared the COVID pandemic a national emergency. § 1098ee(4), see 87 Fed. Reg. 10289 (2022). The eligible borrowers all fall within the law's definition of affected individuals. § 1098ee(2), see supra, at 2392. And the Secretary deemed relief necessary to ensure that the pandemic did not put low- and middle-income borrowers in a worse position to repay their loans. §§ 1098bb(a)(1)-(2).2 With those boxes  checked, the Secretary's waiver/modification powers kick in. And the Secretary used them just as described in the hypothetical above. For purposes of the COVID program, he scratched the conditions for loan discharge contained in several provisions. See App. 261-262 (citing §§ 1087, 1087dd(g), 34 C.F.R. §§ 682.402, 685.212). He then altered those provisions by specifying different conditions, which opened up loan forgiveness to more borrowers. So he waived and modified pre-existing law and, in so doing, applied new terms and conditions in lieu of the old. §§ 1098bb(a)(1), (b)(2), see 87 Fed. Reg. 61514. As in the prior hypothetical, then, he used his statutory emergency powers in the manner Congress designed.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,161,"How does the majority avoid this conclusion? By picking the statute apart, and addressing each segment of Congress's authorization as if it had nothing to do with the others. For the first several pages— really, the heart—of its analysis, the majority proceeds as though the statute contains only the word modify. See ante, at 13-15. It eventually gets around to the word waive, but similarly spends most of its time treating that word alone. See ante, at 2369-2370. Only when that discussion is over does the majority inform the reader that the statute also contemplates the Secretary's addition of new terms and conditions. See ante, at 17-18. But once again the majority treats that authority in isolation, and thus as insignificant. Each aspect of the Secretary's authority—waiver, modification, replacement—is kept sealed in a vacuum-packed container. The way they connect and reinforce each other is generally ignored. Divide to conquer is the watchword. So there cannot possibly emerge a fair construction of the whole instrument. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 4 Wheat. 316, 406, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). The majority fails to read the statutory authorization right because it fails to read it whole. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 167-169 (2012) (discussing the importance of the whole-text—here, really, the whole-sentence—canon).",Kagan,0,
2022-038,162,"The majority's cardinal error is reading modify as if it were the only word in the statutory delegation. Taken alone, this Court once stated, the word connotes increment and means to change moderately or in minor fashion. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 225, 114 S.Ct. 2223, 129 L.Ed.2d 182 (1994). But no sooner did the Court say that much than it noted the importance of contextual indications. Id., at 226, 114 S.Ct., at 2229, see Scalia & Garner 167 (Context is a primary determinant of meaning). And in the HEROES Act, the dominant piece of context is that modify does not stand alone. It is one part of a couplet: waive or modify. The first verb, as discussed above, means eliminate—usually the most substantial kind of change. See supra, at 2392, accord, ante, at 2370. So the question becomes: Would Congress have given the Secretary power to wholly eliminate a requirement, as well as to relax it just a little bit, but nothing in between? The majority says yes. But the answer is no, because  Congress would not have written so insane a law. The phrase waive or modify instead says to the Secretary: Feel free to get rid of a requirement or, short of that, to alter it to the extent you think appropriate. Otherwise said, the phrase extends from minor changes all the way up to major ones.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,163,"The majority fares no better in claiming that the phrase waive or modify somehow limits the Secretary's ability to add to existing law. Ante, at 2371 (emphasis in original). The majority's explanation of that idea oscillates a fair bit. At times the majority tries to convey that additions as a class are somehow suspect. See ante, at 2370-2371 (looking askance at adding new terms, adding back in, filling the empty space, augmenting, and drafting new language). But that is mistaken. Change often (usually?) involves or necessitates replacements. So when the Secretary uses his statutory power to remove some conditions on loan cancellation, he can under that same power replace them with others. The majority itself must ultimately concede that point. See ante, at 2368-2369, 2370-2371. So it falls back on arguing that the additions allowed cannot be substantial because the statute uses the word modify. Ante, at 2370, see ante, at 2370-2371. But that just doubles down on the majority's most basic error: extracting modify from the waive or modify phrase in order to confine the Secretary to making minor changes. As just shown, the phrase as a whole says the opposite—tells the Secretary that he can make changes along a spectrum, from modest to substantial. See supra, at 2394-2395. And so he can make additions along that spectrum as well. In particular, if he entirely removes existing conditions on loan discharge, he can substitute new ones, he does not have to leave gaping holes.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,164,"Indeed, other language in the statute makes that substitution authority perfectly clear. As noted earlier, the statute refers expressly to the terms and conditions to be applied in lieu of such modified or waived statutory and regulatory provisions. § 1098bb(b)(2), see supra, at 2392-2393. In other words, the statute expects the Secretary's waivers and modifications to involve replacing the usual provisions with different ones. The majority rejoins that the in lieu of language is a wafer-thin reed for the Secretary to rely on because it appears in a humdrum reporting requirement. Ante, at 2371. But the adjectives are by far the best part of that response. It is perfectly true that the language instructs the Secretary to include his new terms and conditions when he provides notice of his waivers or modifications. § 1098bb(b)(2). But that is because the statute contemplates that there will be new terms and conditions to report. In other words, the statute proceeds on the premise that the usual waiver or modification will, contra the majority, involve adding new substantive provisions. Ante, at 2370-2371. The humdrum reporting requirement thus confirms the expansive extent of the Secretary's waiver/modification authority.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,165,"The majority's opposing construction makes the Act inconsequential. The Secretary emerges with no ability to respond to large-scale emergencies in commensurate ways. The creation of any novel and fundamentally different loan forgiveness program is off the table. Ante, at 2369. So, for example, the Secretary could not cancel student loans held by victims of the hypothetical terrorist attack described above. See supra, at 2392-2394. That too would involve the introduction of a whole new regime by way of drafting new substantive conditions for discharging loans. Ante, at 2370-2371. And under the majority's analysis, new loan forbearance policies are similarly out of bounds. When  COVID struck, Secretary DeVos immediately suspended loan repayments and interest accrual for all federally held student loans. See ante, at 2364. The majority claims it is not deciding whether that action was lawful. Ante, at 2371, n. 5. Which is all well and good, except that under the majority's reasoning, how could it not be? The suspension too offered a significant new benefit, and to an even greater number of borrowers. (Indeed, for many borrowers, it was worth much more than the current plan's $10,000 discharge.) So the suspension could no more meet the majority's pivotal definition of modify—as make a minor change —than could the forgiveness plan. Ante, at 2368. On the majority's telling, Congress thought that in the event of a national emergency financially harming borrowers—under a statute gearing potential relief to the measure of that harm, so that affected borrowers end up no less able to repay their loans—the Secretary can do no more than fiddle. He can, the majority says, reduce the number of tax forms borrowers are required to file. Ibid. Or he can waive the requirement that a student provide a written request for a leave of absence. Ante, at 2370. But he can do nothing that would ameliorate an emergency's economic impact on student-loan borrowers.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,166,"That is not the statute Congress wrote. The HEROES Act was designed to deal with national emergencies—typically major in scope, often unpredictable in nature. It gave the Secretary discretionary authority to relieve borrowers of the adverse impacts of many possible crises—as necessary to ensure that those individuals are not in a worse position financially to make repayment. § 1098bb(a)(2). If all the Act's triggers are met, the Secretary can waive or modify the usual provisions relating to student loans, and substitute new terms and conditions. That power extends to the varied provisions governing loan repayment and discharge. Those provisions are, indeed, the most obvious candidates for alteration under a statute drafted to leave borrowers no worse off, in relation to their loans, than before an emergency struck. But the majority will not accept the statute's meaning. At every pass, it imposes limits on an agency's discretion that are not supported by the text. Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2367, 2381, 207 L.Ed.2d 819 (2020). It refuses to apply the Act in accordance with its terms. Explains the majority: However broad the meaning of `waive or modify'—meaning however much power Congress gave the Secretary—this program is just too large. Ante, at 2371.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,168,"The tell comes in the last part of the majority's opinion. When a court is confident in its interpretation of a statute's text, it spells out its reading and hits the send button. Not this Court, not today. This Court needs a whole other chapter to explain why it is striking down the Secretary's plan. And that chapter is not about the statute Congress passed and the President signed, in their representation of many millions of citizens. It instead expresses the Court's own concerns over the exercise of administrative power. Ante, at 2372. Congress may have wanted the Secretary to have wide discretion during emergencies to offer relief to student-loan borrowers. Congress in fact drafted a statute saying as much. And the Secretary acted under that statute in a way that subjects the President he serves to political accountability—the judgment of voters. But none of that is enough. This Court objects to Congress's permitting the Secretary (and other agency officials) to answer so-called major questions. Or at least it objects when the answers given are not  to the Court's satisfaction. So the Court puts its own heavyweight thumb on the scales. It insists that however broad Congress's delegation to the Secretary, it (the Court) will not allow him to use that general authorization to resolve important issues. The question, the majority helpfully tells us, is who has the authority to make such significant calls. Ibid. The answer, as is now becoming commonplace, is this Court. See, e.g., West Virginia, 597 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2587, 213 L.Ed.2d 896, Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2485, 210 L.Ed.2d 856 (2021), see also Sackett v. EPA, 598 U. S. ___, 143 S.Ct. 1322, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023) (using a similar judicially manufactured tool to negate statutory text enabling regulation).",Kagan,0,
2022-038,169,"The majority's stance, as I explained last Term, prevents Congress from doing its policy-making job in the way it thinks best. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___ - ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2632-36, 2641-2644 (dissenting opinion). The new major-questions doctrine works not to better understand—but instead to trump—the scope of a legislative delegation. See id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2643-44. Here is a fact of the matter: Congress delegates to agencies often and broadly. And it usually does so for sound reasons. Because agencies have expertise Congress lacks. Because times and circumstances change, and agencies are better able to keep up and respond. Because Congress knows that if it had to do everything, many desirable and even necessary things wouldn't get done. In wielding the major-questions sword, last Term and this one, this Court overrules those legislative judgments. The doctrine forces Congress to delegate in highly specific terms—respecting, say, loan forgiveness of certain amounts for borrowers of certain incomes during pandemics of certain magnitudes. Of course Congress sometimes delegates in that way. But also often not. Because if Congress authorizes loan forgiveness, then what of loan forbearance? And what of the other 10 or 20 or 50 knowable and unknowable things the Secretary could do? And should the measure taken—whether forgiveness or forbearance or anything else— always be of the same size? Or go to the same classes of people? Doesn't it depend on the nature and scope of the pandemic, and on a host of other foreseeable and unforeseeable factors? You can see the problem. It is hard to identify and enumerate every possible application of a statute to every possible condition years in the future. So, again, Congress delegates broadly. Except that this Court now won't let it reap the benefits of that choice.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,170,"And that is a major problem not just for governance, but for democracy too. Congress is of course a democratic institution, it responds, even if imperfectly, to the preferences of American voters. And agency officials, though not themselves elected, serve a President with the broadest of all political constituencies. But this Court? It is, by design, as detached as possible from the body politic. That is why the Court is supposed to stick to its business—to decide only cases and controversies (but see supra, at 2385-2391), and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief. The policy judgments, under our separation of powers, are supposed to come from Congress and the President. But they don't when the Court refuses to respect the full scope of the delegations that Congress makes to the Executive Branch. When that happens, the Court becomes the arbiter—indeed, the maker—of national policy. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2643 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (The Court, rather than Congress, will decide how much regulation is too much). That is no  proper role for a court. And it is a danger to a democratic order.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,171,"The HEROES Act is a delegation both purposive and clear. Recall that Congress enacted the statute after passing two similar laws responding to specific crises. See supra, at 2391-2392. Congress knew that national emergencies would continue to arise. And Congress decided that when they did, the Secretary should have the power to offer relief without waiting for another, incident-specific round of legislation. Emergencies, after all, are emergencies, where speed is of the essence. For similar reasons, Congress replicated its prior (two-time) choice to leave the scope and nature of the loan relief to the Secretary, so that he could respond to varied conditions. As the House Report noted, Congress provided the authority to implement waivers that were not yet contemplated but might become necessary to deal with any unforeseen issues that may arise. H. R. Rep. No. 108-122, pp. 8-9 (2003). That delegation is at the statute's very center, in its waive or modify language. And the authority it grants goes only to the Secretary—the official Congress knew to hold the responsibility for administering the Government's student-loan portfolio and programs. See § 1082. Student loans are in the Secretary's wheelhouse. And so too, Congress decided, relief from those loan obligations in case of emergency. That delegation was the entire point of the HEROES Act. Indeed, the statute accomplishes nothing else.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,172,"The majority is therefore wrong to say that the indicators from our previous major questions cases are present here. Ante, at 2374 (internal quotation marks omitted). Compare the HEROES Act to other statutes containing broad delegations that the same majority has found to raise major-questions problems. Last Term, for example, the majority thought the trouble with the Clean Power Plan lay in the EPA's use of a long-extant and ancillary provision addressed to other matters. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2610. Before that, the majority invalidated the CDC's eviction moratorium because the agency had asserted authority far outside its particular domain. Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2489. I thought both those decisions wrong. But assume the opposite, there is, even on that view, nothing like those circumstances here. (Or, to quote the majority quoting me, those cases are distinguishable from this one. Ante, at 2374.) In this case, the Secretary responsible for carrying out the student-loan programs forgave student loans in a national emergency under the core provision of a recently enacted statute empowering him to provide student-loan relief in national emergencies.3 Today's decision  thus moves the goalposts for triggering the major-questions doctrine. Who knows—by next year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may be found unable to implement the Medicare program under a broad delegation because of his actions' (enormous) economic impact. Ante, at 2373.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,173,"To justify this use of its heightened-specificity requirement, the majority relies largely on history: Past waivers and modifications, the majority argues, have been extremely modest. Ante, at 2372. But first, it depends what you think is past. One prior action, nowhere counted by the majority, is the suspension of loan payments and interest accrual begun in COVID's first days. That action cost the Federal Government over $100 billion, and benefited many more borrowers than the forgiveness plan at issue. See supra, at 2395-2396. And second, it's all relative. Past actions were more modest because the precipitating emergencies were more modest. (The COVID emergency generated, all told, over $5 trillion in Government relief spending.) In providing more significant relief for a more significant emergency —or call it unprecedented relief for an unprecedented emergency—the Secretary did what the HEROES Act contemplates. Imagine asking the enacting Congress: Can the Secretary use his powers to give borrowers more relief when an emergency has inflicted greater harm? I can't believe the majority really thinks Congress would have answered no. In any event, the statute Congress passed does not say no. Delegations like the HEROES Act are designed to enable agencies to adapt their rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances. FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 157, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). Congress allows, and indeed expects, agencies to take more serious measures in response to more serious problems.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,174,"Similarly unavailing is the majority's reliance on the controversy surrounding the program. Student-loan cancellation, the majority says, raises questions that are personal and emotionally charged, precipitating profound debate across the country. Ante, at 2358. I have no quarrel with that description. Student-loan forgiveness, and responses to COVID generally, have joined the list of issues on which this Nation is divided. But that provides yet more reason for the Court to adhere to its properly limited role. There are two paths here. One is to respect the political branches' judgments. On that path, the Court recognizes the breadth of Congress's delegation to the Secretary, and declines to interfere with his use of that granted authority. Maybe Congress was wrong to give the Secretary so much discretion, or maybe he, and the President he serves, did not make good use of it. But if so, there are political remedies—accountability for all the actors, up to the President, who the public thinks have made mistakes. So a political controversy is resolved by political means, as our Constitution requires. That is one path. Now here is the other, the one the Court takes. Wielding its judicially manufactured heightened-specificity requirement, the Court refuses to acknowledge the plain words of the HEROES Act. It declines to respect Congress's decision to give broad emergency powers to the Secretary. It strikes down his lawful use of that authority to provide student-loan assistance. It does not let the political system, with its mechanisms of accountability, operate as normal. It makes itself the decisionmaker on, of all things, federal student-loan policy. And then, perchance, it  wonders why it has only compounded the sharp debates in the country? Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,176,"From the first page to the last, today's opinion departs from the demands of judicial restraint. At the behest of a party that has suffered no injury, the majority decides a contested public policy issue properly belonging to the politically accountable branches and the people they represent. In saying so, and saying so strongly, I do not at all disparage those who disagree. Ante, at 2376. The majority is right to make that point, as well as to say that reasonable minds are found on both sides of this case. Ante, at 2375-2376. And there is surely nothing personal in the dispute here. But Justices throughout history have raised the alarm when the Court has overreached—when it has exceeded its proper, limited role in our Nation's governance. Supra, at 2384. It would have been disturbing, and indeed damaging, if they had not. Ante, at 2375-2376. The same is true in our own day.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,177,"The majority's opinion begins by distorting standing doctrine to create a case fit for judicial resolution. But there is no such case here, by any ordinary measure. The Secretary's plan has not injured the plaintiff-States, however much they oppose it. And in that respect, Missouri is no different from any of the others. Missouri does not suffer any harm from a revenue loss to MOHELA, because the two entities are legally and financially independent. And MOHELA has chosen not to sue—which of course it could have. So no proper party is before the Court. A court acting like a court would have said as much and stopped.",Kagan,0,
2022-038,178,"The opinion ends by applying the Court's made-up major-questions doctrine to jettison the Secretary's loan forgiveness plan. Small wonder the majority invokes the doctrine. The majority's normal statutory interpretation cannot sustain its decision. The statute, read as written, gives the Secretary broad authority to relieve a national emergency's effect on borrowers' ability to repay their student loans. The Secretary did no more than use that lawfully delegated authority. So the majority applies a rule specially crafted to kill significant regulatory action, by requiring Congress to delegate not just clearly but also micro-specifically. The question, the majority maintains, is who has the authority to decide whether such a significant action should go forward. Ante, at 2372, see supra, at 2397. The right answer is the political branches: Congress in broadly authorizing loan relief, the Secretary and the President in using that authority to implement the forgiveness plan. The majority instead says that it is theirs to decide.",Kagan,0,

2022-039,27,"In August 2022, the Secretary of Education announced a large-scale student-loan forgiveness program. He pledged to discharge hundreds of billions of dollars in student-loan debt owed by millions of borrowers. According to the Secretary, the discharge was necessary to alleviate hardship caused by the impending resumption of loan repayments, which had been suspended during the multi-year coronavirus pandemic, and he therefore invoked authority that he claimed he enjoyed under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act). 117 Stat. 904, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1070 et seq. The following month, the Secretary directed that specific actions be taken to implement the loan-forgiveness plan (Plan). The amount of relief available to a borrower under the Plan depends on various criteria, including the borrower's income and the type of loan the borrower holds.",Alito,0,
2022-039,28,"Before the Plan took effect, however, various plaintiffs—including respondents here—sued to enjoin it. Respondents are two individual borrowers who, for different reasons, do not qualify for the maximum relief available under the Plan. They argue that the Department of Education promulgated the Plan without following mandatory procedures known as (1) negotiated rulemaking and (2) notice and comment. The District Court held in favor of respondents, and we granted certiorari before judgment to consider this case alongside Biden v. Nebraska, No. 22-506, which presents a similar challenge to the Plan.",Alito,0,

S. ___, 143 S.Ct 2355, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023), recounts the relevant background of the HEROES Act, so only a brief summary is provided here. The Act authorizes the Secretary of Education to waive or modify any provision applicable to federal student financial assistance programs as may be necessary to ensure that  recipients of student financial assistance who live or work in a declared disaster area, or suffer direct economic hardship as a result of a national emergency, are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance because of the disaster or emergency. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1098bb(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), 1098ee(2)(C)-(D).",Alito,0,
2022-039,33,"In addition to this substantive grant of authority, the HEROES Act dispenses with certain procedural rules for actions taken pursuant to it.",Alito,0,
2022-039,34,"First, the HEROES Act permits the Secretary to implement any waivers and  modifications authorized or required by the Act without engaging in the negotiated rulemaking that is typically required before proposing regulations relating to student financial assistance. § 1098bb(d). Negotiated rulemaking is a lengthy deliberative process involving many stakeholders. Pursuant to this process, the Secretary must first obtain advice of and recommendations from a long list of sources, including individuals and representatives of groups such as students, legal assistance organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, State student grant agencies, guaranty agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies. § 1098a(a)(1). Then, informed by this consultation, the Secretary must submit draft regulations for consideration in a negotiation process involving participants who are chosen by the Secretary from individuals nominated by such groups. § 1098a(b)(1). Only after taking these steps may the Secretary publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register, ibid., accompanied by a summary of the information the Secretary received throughout the process, § 1098a(a)(2). The HEROES Act, however, permits the Secretary to bypass this onerous process. § 1098bb(d).",Alito,0,
2022-039,35,"The HEROES Act also authorizes the Secretary to bypass notice-and-comment procedures that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) would otherwise demand. The APA typically requires agencies to give the public general notice of a proposed rule making by publication in the Federal Register, and then to provide interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments regarding the proposed rule. 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c). The agency may promulgate a final rule only after providing notice and opportunity for comment. § 553(c). But the HEROES Act instead permits the Secretary to implement the waivers and modifications he deems necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act merely by publishing notice in the Federal Register. 20 U.S.C. § 1098bb(b)(1).",Alito,0,
2022-039,37,"On September 27, 2022, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, invoking authority under the HEROES Act, directed the issuance of waivers and modifications that would bring about the forgiveness of a substantial amount of student-loan debt. In particular, he purported to effect the discharge of (1) $10,000 of eligible, federally held student-loan debt for any individual borrower with 2020 or 2021 income under $125,000 (or household income under $250,000), and (2) an additional $10,000 (making a total of $20,000) for any such borrower who had ever received a Pell Grant. Pell Grants are Government-funded grants to help defray the cost of postsecondary education, eligibility for these grants turns principally on the income of a student's family when the student applies to and is enrolled in the relevant educational program (almost always undergraduate study). See §§ 1070a(b)(2), 1087mm(a), 1091, see also 34 C.F.R. § 690.6(c) (2022) (limited eligibility for students in a qualifying postbaccalaureate program). Secretary Cardona directed that these actions be taken via a publication in the Federal Register, see App. 262, all agree that he did not observe the generally applicable negotiated-rulemaking or notice-and-comment processes in devising and announcing the Plan.",Alito,0,
2022-039,38,"Notwithstanding the Plan's scope and expense, not all student-loan borrowers were pleased with it. Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor, plaintiffs in this case,  are two such dissatisfied borrowers, albeit for different reasons. Brown's loans are commercially held, id., at 171, Complaint ¶10, meaning that her creditor is an entity other than the Federal Government. The Plan, however, applies only to borrowers whose loans fall into one or more categories of loans held by the Department. 87 Fed. Reg. 61513 (2022). Consequently, Brown is not entitled to any loan forgiveness under the Plan.",Alito,0,
2022-039,39,"Taylor, on the other hand, is eligible for loan forgiveness—but only $10,000, rather than the maximum $20,000. That is because, despite now having an annual income of less than $25,000, he never received a Pell Grant. See App. 183, Complaint ¶61. Thus, individuals with annual income up to five times greater than his are eligible for twice as much loan forgiveness as he is if they ever received a Pell Grant.",Alito,0,
2022-039,40,"Accordingly, both Brown and Taylor object to certain elements of the Plan— Brown to its limitation to federally held loans, and Taylor to the additional relief it doles out based on prior Pell Grants, with no regard for current income. Because the Department did not engage in negotiated rulemaking or notice and comment, however, Brown and Taylor had no formal opportunity to voice their views on the Plan prior to its adoption.",Alito,0,
2022-039,41,"Alleging that the law entitles them to such an opportunity, Brown and Taylor brought this action in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Their one-count complaint claims that the Plan is unlawful because the Department promulgated it without observing the requirements of negotiated rulemaking and notice and comment. As a result, they claim, we should vacate and set aside the Plan under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). App. 186.",Alito,0,
2022-039,42,"Brown and Taylor recognize that the HEROES Act supplies exemptions from these procedural requirements. They argue, however, that an action of the Secretary falls within these exemptions only if it is substantively authorized by the Act, the Secretary, in their view, cannot merely invoke the HEROES Act to bypass negotiated rulemaking and notice and comment. According to Brown and Taylor, the Act does not substantively authorize the Plan, and so the Secretary was required to follow these procedures.",Alito,0,
2022-039,43,"The District Court agreed with Brown and Taylor—in part. It rebuffed their central argument that the HEROES Act exempts from procedural requirements only those actions that the Act substantively authorizes. But the District Court nonetheless held that the Plan exceeds the Secretary's authority under the HEROES Act and therefore entered judgment vacating it. ___ F.

In particular, we hold that Brown and Taylor fail to establish that any injury they suffer from not having their loans forgiven is fairly traceable to the Plan.",Alito,0,
2022-039,48,"Our authority under the Constitution is limited to resolving Cases or Controversies. Art. III, § 2. The doctrine of standing, among others, implements this limit on our authority. Carney, 592 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 498. Our jurisprudence has established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements that a plaintiff must plead and—ultimately—prove. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). First, the plaintiff must have suffered an `injury in fact' that is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Ibid. (some internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the plaintiff's injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, meaning that there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Third, it must be `likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,' that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

2022-039,49,"We have found, however, that when a statute affords a litigant a procedural right to protect his concrete interests, the litigant may establish Article III jurisdiction without meeting the usual standards for redressability and immediacy. Id., at 572, n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130. For example, we hypothesized a person living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam and explained that this person has standing to challenge the licensing agency's failure to prepare an environmental impact statement, even though he cannot establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered. Ibid. In this context, the fact that the defendant might well come to the same decision after abiding by the contested procedural requirement does not deprive a plaintiff of standing.",Alito,0,
2022-039,50,"Regardless of the redressability showing we have tolerated in the procedural-rights context, we have never held a litigant who asserts such a right is excused from demonstrating that it has a concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation of the claimed right.

The plaintiffs in that case did not have any concrete plans to observe nature in a specific area affected by actions the Service took pursuant to this exemption, id., at 497, 129 S.Ct. 1142, and we therefore held that they lacked standing, id., at 494-497, 129 S.Ct. 1142. As we put it, the deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation—a procedural right in vacuo  —is insufficient to create Article III standing.

2022-039,54,"Upon initial inspection, respondents' merits theory appears to be in tension with the possibility that the Department could redress their injury. Respondents argue simultaneously (1) that the Department might have treated them more generously if it had solicited their input in developing the Plan and (2) that the Department lacks substantive authority to promulgate broad-based loan forgiveness under the HEROES Act. It would be quite odd for Brown and Taylor to complain about being unable to seek an increase in the scope of an administrative action that they think the Department cannot lawfully take.",Alito,0,
2022-039,55,"Respondents belatedly attempted to address this strange feature of their argument. Their complaint does not say a word about standing. But in their reply supporting their motion in the District Court for an injunction against the Plan, they ventured a brief attempt to explain their position on this threshold issue. They insisted that the Department cannot adopt the Plan under the HEROES Act regardless of the procedures it follows. Reply in No. 4:22-cv-908 (ND Tex., Oct. 20, 2022), ECF Doc. 26, pp. 3-4. But they observed that the Department has claimed it also has authority to forgive loans under a different statute, the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), which authorizes the Secretary to compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand. 20 U.S.C. § 1082(a)(6). Thus, respondents argued, there is a chance that vacating the Plan would prompt the Department to pursue loan relief under the HEA instead. In this Court, Brown and Taylor discuss the HEA at length for the first time in this litigation. See Brief for Respondents 28-32.",Alito,0,
2022-039,56,"Having recounted this history, we now understand respondents' claim and theory of standing as follows. First, because the HEROES Act does not substantively authorize the Plan, the Department was obligated to follow the typical negotiated-rulemaking and notice-and-comment requirements. Second, if the Department had observed those procedures, respondents might have used those opportunities to convince the Department (1) that proceeding under the HEROES Act is unlawful or otherwise undesirable, and (2) that it should adopt a different loan-forgiveness plan under the HEA instead, one that is more generous to them than the HEROES Act plan that they allege is unlawful. They assert there is at least a chance that this series of events will come to pass now if we vacate the Plan. Id., at 19.",Alito,0,
2022-039,58,"Describing respondents' claim illustrates how unusual it is. They claim they are injured because the Government has not adopted a lawful benefits program under which they would qualify for assistance. But the same could be said of anyone who might benefit from a benefits program that the Government has not chosen to adopt. It is difficult to see how such an injury could be particular (since all people suffer it) or concrete (since an as-yet-uncreated benefits plan is necessarily `abstract' and not `real').1 Spokeo,  Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016), see also Allen v.

Nor have we ever accepted that an injury is redressable when the prospect of redress turns on the Government's wholly discretionary decision to create a new regulatory or benefits program.",Alito,0,
2022-039,59,"Nonetheless, we think the deficiencies of respondents' claim are clearest with respect to traceability. They cannot show that their purported injury of not receiving loan relief under the HEA is fairly traceable to the Department's (allegedly unlawful) decision to grant loan relief under the HEROES Act.",Alito,0,
2022-039,61,"At the outset, we reiterate what respondents' claim is not. Respondents are not claiming that they are injured by not being included in the Plan (or, in Taylor's case, by being remunerated by the Plan less generously than he thinks himself entitled to). After all, they think the Plan is substantively unlawful, a merits contention that we accept as valid for purposes of analyzing standing. Federal Election Comm'n v. Ted Cruz for Senate, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1638, 1647, 212 L.Ed.2d 654 (2022). It would be quite strange to think that a party experiences an Article III injury by not being affected by an unlawful action (in Brown's case) or not being more affected by such action (in Taylor's).",Alito,0,
2022-039,62,"Instead, respondents seek relief under a separate statutory source. They name the HEA as that potential source, but presumably they would be pleased for the Department to invoke any other lawful source (if one exists) as grounds for granting them loan relief. Their interest is in obtaining loan forgiveness in general.",Alito,0,
2022-039,63,"The Plan, however, is independent of any student-loan relief the Department might craft under the HEA (or any other statute). A decision by this Court that the Plan is lawful would have no effect on the Department's ability to forgive respondents' loans under the HEA.2 Thus, the Plan poses no legal obstacle to the Department's choosing to find other ways to remedy the harm respondents experience from not having their loans forgiven.",Alito,0,
2022-039,64,"Put differently, the Department's decision to give other people relief under a different statutory scheme did not cause respondents not to obtain the benefits they want. The cause of their supposed injury is far more pedestrian than that: The Department has simply chosen not to give them the relief they want. Ordinarily, a party's recourse to induce an agency to take a desired action is to file not a lawsuit, but a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. 5 U.S.C. § 553(e). The denial of such a petition must be justified by a statement of reasons, which in turn can be appealed to the courts if the litigant has standing to maintain such a suit. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 459, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997). Contesting a separate benefits program based on a theory that it crowds out the desired one, however, is an approach for which we have been unable to find any precedent.",Alito,0,
2022-039,65,"It is true that in procedural-standing cases, we tolerate uncertainty over whether observing certain procedures would have led to (caused) a different substantive outcome, as with Lujan's example of the dam and the bypassed environmental impact statement. See 504 U.S. at 572, n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130. In this case, however, the causal uncertainty is not merely over whether observing certain procedures would have led to a different substantive outcome. Instead, the uncertainty concerns whether the substantive decisions the Department has made regarding the Plan under the HEROES Act have a causal relationship with other substantive decisions respondents want the Department to make under the HEA. There is no precedent for tolerating this sort of causal uncertainty.",Alito,0,
2022-039,66,"Our other procedural-standing cases demonstrate the point. In the example posited in Lujan, proceeding with building the dam as planned and simultaneously sparing the adjacent landowner from the negative effects of the dam are mutually exclusive options. See ibid. While it might be uncertain whether undertaking an environmental impact statement would prevent the dam from being built, it is clear that building the dam would directly injure the landowner.",Alito,0,
2022-039,67,"Similarly, in a case like Summers, it might be uncertain whether public comment would alter any particular land-management decision the Forest Service makes. There would be no uncertainty, however, that a plaintiff with concrete plans to observe nature in a particular area would be harmed if the land-management project went forward without incorporation of the ideas he would have suggested in his comments. 555 U.S. at 494, 129 S.Ct. 1142.3",Alito,0,
2022-039,68,"Accordingly, Brown and Taylor need not allege that observing negotiated rulemaking and notice and comment would `force' the Department to reach substantive results more favorable to them than those embodied in the Plan. Lemon v. Geren, 514 F.3d 1312, 1314-1315 (CADC 2008). But they must still show—pursuant to our customary traceability standards— that the Plan's substance causes their injury by impairing loan relief under the HEA.",Alito,0,
2022-039,69,"Brown and Taylor cannot meet this standard. It is purely speculative whether the denial of HEA loan relief—their ostensible injury—fairly can be traced to the Department's decision to grant loan relief in the Plan. Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 42-43, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 503-504, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).",Alito,0,
2022-039,70,"As noted above, HEROES Act loan relief and HEA loan relief function independently of each other. If the Department may lawfully grant loan relief under both the HEROES Act and the HEA, it is entitled to choose to do both, neither, or only one (provided that it sufficiently explains its reasoning, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). There is little reason to think that its discretionary decision to pursue one mechanism of loan relief has anything to do with its discretionary decision to pursue (or not pursue) another. The line of causation between the Department's promulgation of the Plan and respondents' lack of benefits under the HEA is attenuated  at best, Allen, 468 U.S. at 757, 104 S.Ct. 3315, and all too dependent on `conjecture,' Summers, 555 U.S. at 496, 129 S.Ct. 1142.",Alito,0,
2022-039,72,"Respondents' attempts to tie the Plan to potential HEA relief are unavailing. They point to a handful of documents related to the Plan that say that the Department is providing one-time student-loan relief. See, e.g., App. 215, 221, 225. Such statements, Brown and Taylor argue, show that the decision to grant loan relief under the HEROES Act foreclosed HEA relief.",Alito,0,
2022-039,73,"This is insufficient. The Plan itself—the action under review here—contains no reference to one-time relief. See 87 Fed. Reg. 61512-61514. And to the extent that the Department's decision to adopt the Plan under the HEROES Act might have some incidental effect on the likelihood that the Department will undertake a separate loan-forgiveness program under a different statute, the relationship is not sufficiently close to persuade us that the latter is fairly traceable to the former. See, e.g., Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. 1917 (accepting that certain tax rules might `encourage' or `discourage' particular behavior, but nonetheless holding that connection to be insufficient to establish standing where it was just as plausible that actors would forgo favorable tax treatment). Moreover, no one argues that the existing references to one-time relief are legally binding. To whatever extent the Department has determined that the Plan crowds out other efforts to forgive student loans, that, too, is a discretionary and independent decision that respondents may ask it to reconsider with a § 553(e) petition.",Alito,0,
2022-039,74,"Finally, Brown and Taylor also argue that they have demonstrated causation because the Secretary's failure to observe the requisite procedural rules cost them a `chance' to obtain debt forgiveness. Brief for Respondents 28. But referring in the abstract to a chance of obtaining debt forgiveness does not solve their problem. They do not want debt forgiveness under the HEROES Act, which they claim is unlawful. They want debt forgiveness under the HEA. Nothing the Secretary has done deprives them of a chance to seek that result.",Alito,0,
2022-039,75,"Because respondents cannot meaningfully connect the absence of loan relief under the HEA to the adoption of the Plan, they have failed to show that their injury is fairly traceable to the Plan.* * *",Alito,0,
2022-039,76,"For these reasons, respondents lack standing, and we therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with instructions to dismiss. By vacating the District Court's judgment, we obviate the need to grant the interim relief the Department requests in its application in No. 22A489.

In 2018, after concluding that the decades-old Compact had outlived its usefulness, New Jersey sought to withdraw from the Compact.

But by 2018, according to New Jersey, more than 80% of work hours occurred on the New Jersey side, and more than 80% of the Port's cargo flowed through the New Jersey side.

2022-040,38,The question presented is straightforward: Does the Waterfront Commission Compact allow New Jersey to unilaterally withdraw from the Compact notwithstanding New York's opposition? The answer is yes.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,39,"The interpretation of the Waterfront Commission Compact—an interstate compact approved by Congress—presents a federal question. See Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.S. 433, 438, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981). To resolve the dispute over whether each State may unilaterally withdraw, we begin by examining the express terms of the Compact as the best indication of the intent of the parties.

The Compact mentions neither withdrawal nor termination in any relevant context. The Compact provides for amendments, which require both States to agree. See Art. XVI(1), 67 Stat. 557. But unilateral withdrawal does not constitute an amendment to the Compact and thus does not implicate the amendment provision. The Compact also authorizes Congress to alter, amend, or repeal the Compact. See Art. XVI, § 2, ibid. But Congress did not retain an exclusive right to terminate the Compact.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,41,"Because the Compact's text does not address whether a State may unilaterally withdraw, we look to background principles of law that would have informed the parties' understanding when they entered the Compact. This Court has long explained that interstate compacts are construed as contracts under the principles of contract law. Tarrant, 569 U.S. at 628, 133 S.Ct. 2120, see also Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, 359, 130 S.Ct. 2295, 176 L.Ed.2d 1070 (2010) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), Texas v.

To that end, the Court has looked to background principles of contract law to interpret compacts that are silent on a particular issue. Mississippi v. Tennessee, 595 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 31, 41, 211 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021), see Tarrant, 569 U.S. at 628, 633, 133 S.Ct. 2120.",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-040,43,"Under the default contract-law rule at the time of the Compact's 1953 formation, as well as today, a contract (like this Compact) that contemplates continuing performance for an indefinite time is to be interpreted as stipulating only for performance terminable at the will of either party. 1 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 4:23, p. 570 (4th ed. 2022), see also, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33, Comment d, p. 94 (1979), 1 S.

Stafford, Inc., 178 App.Div. 811, 815, 166 N.Y.S. 79, 82 (1917). Parties to a contract that calls for ongoing and indefinite performance generally need not continue performance after the contractual relationship has soured, or when the circumstances that originally motivated the agreement's formation have changed, for example. See Delta Servs. & Equip., Inc. v. Ryko Mfg. Co., 908 F.2d 7, 11 (C.A.5 1990), Jespersen v. Minnesota Min. & Mfg. Co., 183 Ill.2d  290, 295, 233 Ill.Dec. 306, 700 N.E.2d 1014, 1017 (1998).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,44,"That default contract-law rule—that contracts calling for ongoing and indefinite performance may be terminated by either party—supports New Jersey's position in this case. Through the Waterfront Commission Compact, New York and New Jersey delegated their sovereign authority to the Commission on an ongoing and indefinite basis. And the Compact contemplates the Commission's exercise of that authority on an ongoing and indefinite basis. The default contract-law rule therefore speaks in the silence of the Compact and indicates that either State may unilaterally withdraw. New Jersey v. New York, 523 U.S. 767, 784, 118 S.Ct. 1726, 140 L.Ed.2d 993 (1998).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,45,"Principles of state sovereignty likewise support New Jersey's position. The background notion that a State does not easily cede its sovereignty has informed our interpretation of interstate compacts. Tarrant, 569 U.S. at 631, 133 S.Ct. 2120. Here, the Compact involves the delegation of a fundamental aspect of a State's sovereign power—its ability to protect the people, property, and economic activity within its borders—to a bistate agency. The nature of that delegation buttresses our conclusion that New York and New Jersey did not permanently give up, absent the States' joint consent or congressional action to terminate the Compact, their authority to withdraw from the Compact and to exercise those sovereign police powers at the Port as each State sees fit.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,46,"We draw further guidance from the fact that, as is undisputed, New York and New Jersey never intended for the Compact and Commission to operate forever. See Brief for New York 19, 26, Brief for New Jersey 33, n. 8, Tr. of Oral Arg. 69, 100-101. Given that the States did not intend for the agreement to be perpetual, it would not make much sense to conclude that each State implicitly conferred on the other a perpetual veto of withdrawal.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,47,"In sum, background principles of contract law, reinforced here by principles of state sovereignty and the fact that the States did not intend for the Compact to operate forever, indicate that New Jersey may unilaterally withdraw from the Waterfront Commission Compact. To be clear, the contract-law rule that we apply today governs compacts (like this Compact) that are silent as to unilateral withdrawal and that exclusively call for ongoing performance on an indefinite basis. But that rule does not apply to other kinds of compacts that do not exclusively call for ongoing performance on an indefinite basis—such as compacts setting boundaries, apportioning water rights, or otherwise conveying property interests. Both New York and New Jersey agree that States may not unilaterally withdraw from compacts that are silent as to withdrawal and that set boundaries, apportion water rights, or otherwise convey property interests. See Brief for New York 3-4, 30, 38, Brief for New Jersey 27-29, Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 44, 55.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,49,New York advances several additional arguments in support of its view that the Compact nonetheless should be read to prohibit unilateral withdrawal. But none is persuasive.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,50,"First, New York invokes the history of compacts before 1953. In New York's view, many pre-1953 compacts were silent on unilateral withdrawal but nonetheless were understood to forbid it. New York says that when States at that time wanted to allow unilateral withdrawal, the compacts would expressly provide for it. And New  York adds that we should interpret the 1953 Compact in light of that practice.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,51,"As New York acknowledges, however, many of those pre-1953 compacts concerned boundaries and water-rights allocation. See Brief for New York 3-4, 30, Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 33. Those compacts, as we have explained, are not governed by the default contract-law rule authorizing unilateral withdrawal. New York offers no persuasive evidence that the background understanding of withdrawal from boundary and water-rights compacts also applied to compacts that exclusively call for ongoing performance on an indefinite basis by an interstate agency. Indeed, just three years before the Compact here was formed, the United States explained to this Court that a compacting State could unilaterally withdraw from a compact that was silent as to withdrawal and that required an ongoing and indefinite exercise of sovereign authority. See Brief for United States in West Virginia ex rel. Dyer v. Sims, O. T. 1950, No. 147, pp. 23-24, 26-27. In addition, New York overlooks that some compacts, including one formed three years before this Compact, expressly prohibited unilateral withdrawal. See Snake River Compact, Art. XII, 64 Stat. 33, see also, e.g., Goose Lake Basin Compact, Arts. V, VII(B), 98 Stat. 292 (1984). That language would have been unnecessary if New York were correct about the pre-1953 practice.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,52,"In short, New York identifies no clear historical practice in support of its view that compacts calling for ongoing and indefinite performance and that were silent on withdrawal were understood as of 1953 to prohibit unilateral withdrawal.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,53,"Second, New York invokes international treaty law. According to New York, international law generally prohibits a signatory nation's unilateral withdrawal from a treaty absent express language otherwise. But to the extent that international treaty practice is relevant here, it is equivocal. Scholars have long debated whether nations may unilaterally withdraw from treaties that do not expressly authorize withdrawal. L. Helfer, Exiting Treaties, 91 Va. L. Rev. 1579, 1592 (2005). And although the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (to which the United States is not a party) provides that nations generally may not withdraw from a treaty absent express authorization, the Convention acknowledges that the nature of the treaty may nonetheless imply a right of withdrawal. Art. 56(1), May 23, 1969, 1155 U. N. T. S. 331, see also J. Brierly, The Law of Nations 240 (4th ed. 1949).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,54,"Third, New York points out that New York and New Jersey have resolved Commission-related disputes in the decades since 1953. According to New York, that practice suggests that the Compact prohibits unilateral withdrawal. But the States' past success in resolving disputes says little about whether New York or New Jersey could unilaterally withdraw if and when either State wanted to do so.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-040,55,"Fourth, New York argues that allowing New Jersey to withdraw would have sweeping consequences for interstate compacts generally. But our decision today only addresses a compact that (i) is silent on unilateral withdrawal, (ii) calls for ongoing and indefinite performance, and (iii) does not set boundaries, apportion water rights, or otherwise convey property interests. Moreover, for any current and future compacts, States can propose language expressly allowing or prohibiting unilateral withdrawal if they wish to do so.* * *",Kavanaugh,0,

That holding was short-lived: We vacated the judgment, explaining that the panel's choice to inject the overbreadth issue into the appeal and appoint amici to argue it departed so drastically from the principle of party presentation as to constitute an abuse of discretion. 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1575, 1578, 206 L.Ed.2d 866 (2020). On remand, limited to the arguments that Sineneng-Smith had actually made, the Ninth Circuit affirmed her convictions. 982 F.3d 766, 770 (2020). But Hansen's appeal was waiting in the wings, giving the Ninth Circuit a second chance to address the overbreadth question. It reprised its original holding in Sineneng-Smith.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,37,"As in Sineneng-Smith, the Ninth Circuit focused on whether clause (iv) is a narrow prohibition covering solicitation and facilitation of illegal conduct, or a sweeping ban that would pull in statements or conduct that are likely repeated countless times across the country every day. 25 F.4th 1103, 1110 (2022). It adopted the latter interpretation, asserting that clause (iv) criminalizes speech such as encouraging an undocumented immigrant to take shelter during a natural disaster, advising an undocumented immigrant about available social services, telling a tourist that she is unlikely to face serious consequences if she  overstays her tourist visa, or providing certain legal advice to undocumented immigrants. Ibid. Concluding that clause (iv) covers an `alarming' amount of protected speech relative to its narrow legitimate sweep, the Ninth Circuit held the provision facially overbroad. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,38,"The Ninth Circuit denied the Government's petition for rehearing en banc over the dissent of nine judges. Judge Bumatay, who wrote the principal dissent, attributed the panel's overbreadth concern to a misreading of the statute. See 40 F.4th 1049, 1057-1058 (2022). Correctly interpreted, he explained, clause (iv) reaches only criminal solicitation and aiding and abetting. Ibid. On that reading, the provision raises no overbreadth problem because, even if § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) somehow reaches protected speech, that reach is far outweighed by the provision's broad legitimate sweep.

2022-041,41,"The First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom of speech. Wisely, Hansen does not claim that the First Amendment protects the communications for which he was prosecuted. Cf. Illinois ex rel. Madigan v.

Instead, he raises an overbreadth challenge: He argues that clause (iv) punishes so much protected speech that it cannot be applied to anyone, including him. Brief for Respondent 9-10.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,42,"An overbreadth challenge is unusual. For one thing, litigants typically lack standing to assert the constitutional rights of third parties. See, e.g., Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991). For another, litigants mounting a facial challenge to a statute normally must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (emphasis added). Breaking from both of these rules, the overbreadth doctrine instructs a court to hold a statute facially unconstitutional even though it has lawful applications, and even at the behest of someone to whom the statute can be lawfully applied.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,43,"We have justified this doctrine on the ground that it provides breathing room for free expression. Overbroad laws may deter or `chill' constitutionally protected speech, and if would-be speakers remain silent, society will lose their contributions to the marketplace of ideas. Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 119, 123 S.Ct. 2191, 156 L.Ed.2d 148 (2003). To guard against those harms, the overbreadth doctrine allows a litigant (even an undeserving one) to vindicate the rights of the silenced, as well as society's broader interest in hearing them speak. Williams, 553 U.S. at 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830. If the challenger demonstrates that the statute prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its plainly legitimate sweep, then society's interest in free expression outweighs its interest in the statute's lawful applications, and a court will hold the law facially invalid.

2022-041,48,"To judge whether a statute is overbroad, we must first determine what it covers. Recall that § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) makes it unlawful to encourage or induce an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law.1 The issue is whether Congress used encourage and induce as terms of art referring to criminal solicitation and facilitation (thus capturing only a narrow band of speech) or instead as those terms are used in everyday conversation (thus encompassing a broader swath). An overbreadth challenge obviously has better odds on the latter view.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,50,"We start with some background on solicitation and facilitation. Criminal solicitation is the intentional encouragement of an unlawful act. ALI, Model Penal Code § 5.02(1), p. 364 (1985) (MPC), 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 11.1 (3d ed. 2022) (LaFave). Facilitation—also called aiding and abetting —is the provision of assistance to a wrongdoer with the intent to further an offense's commission. See, e.g., Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 143 S.Ct. 1206, 1221-1222, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023). While the crime of solicitation is complete as soon as the encouragement occurs, see LaFave § 11.1, liability for aiding and abetting requires that a wrongful act be carried out, see id., § 13.2(a). Neither solicitation nor facilitation requires lending physical aid, for both, words may be enough. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 178, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993) (one may aid and abet by providing `assistance rendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or presence'), MPC § 5.02(2), at 365 (solicitation may take place through words or conduct), LaFave § 11.1(c) (same). Both require an intent to bring about a particular unlawful act. See, e.g., Hicks v. United States, 150 U.S. 442, 449, 14 S.Ct. 144, 37 L.Ed. 1137 (1893) (Words of encouragement and abetting must be used with the intention as respects the effect to be produced). And both are longstanding criminal theories targeting those who support the crimes of a principal wrongdoer. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 181, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994), LaFave § 11.1(a).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,51,"The terms encourage and induce are among the most common verbs used to denote solicitation and facilitation. Id., § 13.2(a), see also 1 J. Ohlin, Wharton's Criminal Law § 10:1, p. 298 (16th ed. 2021) (Wharton) (Additional language—such as encourage, counsel, and command—usually accompanies `aid' or `abet' (emphasis added)). In fact, their criminal-law usage dates back hundreds of years. See 40 F.4th at 1062-1064 (opinion of Bumatay, J.). A prominent early American legal dictionary, for instance, defines abet as to encourage  or set another on to commit a crime. 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 30 (1839) (emphasis added). Other sources agree. See, e.g., Wharton § 10:1, at 298 (`abet,' at common law, meant to encourage, advise, or instigate the commission of a crime (emphasis added)), Black's Law Dictionary 6 (1st ed. 1891) (to abet in criminal law was to encourage, incite, or set another on to commit a crime (emphasis added)), cf. id., at 667 (11th ed. 2019) (defining encourage with, in part, a cross-reference to aid and abet).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,52,"This pattern is on display in the federal criminal code, which, for over a century, has punished one who induces a crime as a principal. See Act of Mar. 4, 1909, § 332, 35 Stat. 1152 (Whoever  aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of an offense is a principal (emphasis added)), 18 U.S.C. § 2(a) (listing the same verbs today). The Government offers other examples as well: The ban on soliciting a crime of violence penalizes those who solicit, command, induce, or otherwise endeavor to persuade another person to engage in the unlawful conduct. § 373(a) (emphasis added). Federal law also criminalizes persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing one to engage in prostitution or other unlawful sexual activity involving interstate commerce. §§ 2422(a), (b) (emphasis added). The Model Penal Code echoes these formulations, defining solicitation as, in relevant part, commanding, encouraging or requesting another person to engage in specific unlawful conduct. MPC § 5.02(1), at 364 (emphasis added). And the commentary to the Model Penal Code notes that similar prohibitions may employ other verbs, such as induce. See id., Comment 3, at 372-373, n. 25 (collecting examples).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,53,"The use of both verbs to describe solicitation and facilitation is widespread in the States too. Nevada considers every person who aided, abetted, counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced, or procured an offense to be a principal. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 195.020 (2021) (emphasis added). Arizona provides that one who commands, encourages, requests, or solicits another person to engage in specific conduct commits the offense of solicitation. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-1002(A) (2020) (emphasis added). And New Mexico imposes criminal liability on one who with the intent for another to commit a crime solicits, commands, requests, induces  or otherwise attempts to promote or facilitate the offense. N. M. Stat. Ann. § 30-28-3(A) (2018) (emphasis added). These States are by no means outliers—induce or encourage describe similar offenses in the criminal codes of every State. App. to Brief for State of Montana et al. as Amici Curiae 1-44, see, e.g., Ala. Code § 13A-2-23(1) (2015) (induces), Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-1-603 (2022) (encourages), Fla. Stat. § 777.04(2) (2022) (encourages), Haw. Rev. Stat. § 705-510(1) (2014) (encourages), Ind. Code § 35-41-2-4 (2022) (induces), Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21-5303(a) (2020) (encouraging), N. D. Cent.

Ann. § 6-1-302(a) (2021) (encourages).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,54,"In sum, the use of encourage and induce to describe solicitation and facilitation is both longstanding and pervasive. And if 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) refers to solicitation and facilitation as they are typically understood, an overbreadth challenge would be hard to sustain.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,56,"Hansen, like the Ninth Circuit, insists that clause (iv) uses encourages and induces  in their ordinary rather than their specialized sense. While he offers definitions from multiple dictionaries, the terms are so familiar that two samples suffice. In ordinary parlance, induce means to lead on, to influence, to prevail on, to move by persuasion or influence. Webster's New International Dictionary 1269 (2d ed. 1953). And encourage means to inspire with courage, spirit, or hope. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 747 (1966).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,57,"In Hansen's view, clause (iv)'s use of the bare words encourages or induces conveys these ordinary meanings. See Brief for Respondent 14. That encouragement can include aiding and abetting, he says, does not mean it is restricted to aiding and abetting. Id., at 25. And because clause (iv) proscribes encouragement, full stop, id., at 14, it prohibits even an op-ed or public speech criticizing the immigration system and supporting the rights of long-term undocumented noncitizens to remain, at least where the author or speaker knows that, or recklessly disregards whether, any of her readers or listeners are undocumented. Id., at 17-18. If the statute reaches the many examples that Hansen posits, its applications to protected speech might swamp its lawful applications, rendering it vulnerable to an overbreadth challenge.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,59,"We hold that clause (iv) uses encourages or induces in its specialized, criminal-law sense—that is, as incorporating common-law liability for solicitation and facilitation. In truth, the clash between definitions is not much of a contest. Encourage and induce have well-established legal meanings—and when Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), see also, e.g., United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 13-14, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,60,"To see how this works, consider the word attempts, which appears in clause (iv)'s next-door neighbors. See §§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii). In a criminal prohibition, we would not understand attempt in its ordinary sense of try. Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 133 (2d ed. 2001). We would instead understand it to mean taking a substantial step toward the completion of a crime with the requisite mens rea. United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 107, 127 S.Ct. 782, 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007). Encourages or induces likewise carries a specialized meaning. After all, when a criminal-law term is used in a criminal-law statute, that—in and of itself—is a good clue that it takes its criminal-law meaning. And the inference is even stronger here, because clause (iv) prohibits encouraging and inducing a violation of law. See § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv). That is the focus of criminal solicitation and facilitation too.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,61,"In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit stacked the deck in favor of ordinary meaning. See 25 F.4th at 1109-1110, see also United States v. Hernandez-Calvillo, 39 F.4th 1297, 1304 (C.A.10 2022) (Our construction of the verbs in clause (iv) begins with their ordinary meaning, not their specialized meaning in criminal law). But it should have given specialized meaning a fair shake. When words have several plausible definitions, context differentiates among them. That is just as true when the choice is between ordinary and specialized meanings, see, e.g., Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 202, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974)  (While a layman might well assume that time of day worked reflects one aspect of a job's `working conditions,' the term has a different and much more specific meaning in the language of industrial relations), as it is when a court must choose among multiple ordinary meanings, see, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 127-128, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (choosing between ordinary meanings of carry). Here, the context of these words—the water in which they swim— indicates that Congress used them as terms of art.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,62,"Statutory history is an important part of this context. In 1885, Congress enacted a law that would become the template for clause (iv). That law prohibited knowingly assisting, encouraging or soliciting immigration under a contract to perform labor. Act of Feb. 26, 1885, ch. 164, § 3, 23 Stat. 333 (1885 Act) (emphasis added). Then, as now, encourage had a specialized meaning that channeled accomplice liability. See 1 Bouvier, Law Dictionary 30 (abet means to encourage or set another on to commit a crime), Black's Law Dictionary 6 (1891) (to abet is to encourage, incite, or set another on to commit a crime). And the words assisting and soliciting, which appeared alongside encouraging in the 1885 Act, reinforce that Congress gave the word encouraging its narrower criminal-law meaning. See Dubin v. United States, 599 U. S. ___, ___, 143 S.Ct. 1557, 1569, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023) (a word capable of many meanings is refined by its neighbors, which often `avoids the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress'). Unsurprisingly, then, when this Court upheld the 1885 Act against a constitutional challenge, it explained that Congress has the power to punish any who assist in introducing noncitizens into the country—without suggesting that the term encouraging altered the scope of the prohibition. Lees v. United States, 150 U.S. 476, 480, 14 S.Ct. 163, 37 L.Ed. 1150 (1893) (emphasis added).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,63,"In the ensuing decades, Congress both added to and subtracted from the encouraging prohibition in the 1885 Act. Throughout, it continued to place encouraging alongside assisting and soliciting. See Act of Mar. 3, 1903, § 5, 32 Stat. 1214-1215, Act of Feb. 20, 1907, § 5, 34 Stat. 900. Then, in 1917, Congress added induce to the string of verbs. Act of Feb. 5, 1917, § 5, 39 Stat. 879 (1917 Act) (making it a crime to induce, assist, encourage, or solicit, or attempt to induce, assist, encourage, or solicit the importation or migration of any contract laborer  into the United States). Like encourage, the word induce carried solicitation and facilitation overtones at the time of this enactment. See Black's Law Dictionary 617 (1891) (defining inducement to mean that which leads or tempts to the commission of crime). In fact, Congress had just recently used the term in a catchall prohibition on criminal facilitation. See Act of Mar. 4, 1909, § 332, 35 Stat. 1152 (Whoever aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of an offense, is a principal (emphasis added)). And as with encourage, the meaning of induce was clarified and narrowed by its statutory neighbors in the 1917 Act—assist and solicit.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,64,"Congress enacted the immediate forerunner of the modern clause (iv) in 1952 and, in doing so, simplified the language from the 1917 Act. Most notably, the 1952 version dropped the words assist and solicit, instead making it a crime to willfully or knowingly encourage or induce, or attempt to encourage or induce, either directly or indirectly, the entry into the United States of  any alien  not lawfully entitled to enter or reside within the United States. Immigration and Nationality Act, § 274(a)(4), 66 Stat. 229.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,65,"Three decades later, Congress brought 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) into its current form—still without the words assist or solicit. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, § 112(a), 100 Stat. 3382 (making it a crime to encourage or induce an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,66,"On Hansen's view, these changes dramatically broadened the scope of clause (iv)'s prohibition on encouragement. Before 1952, he says, the words assist and solicit may have cabined encourage and induce, but eliminating them severed any connection the prohibition had to solicitation and facilitation. Brief for Respondent 25-26. In other words, Hansen claims, the 1952 and 1986 revisions show that Congress opted to make protected speech, not conduct, a crime. Id., at 27.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,67,"We do not agree that the mere removal of the words assist and solicit turned an ordinary solicitation and facilitation offense into a novel and boundless restriction on speech. Hansen's argument would require us to assume that Congress took a circuitous route to convey a sweeping— and constitutionally dubious—message. The better understanding is that Congress simply streamlined the pre-1952 statutory language—which, as any nonlawyer who has picked up the U.S. Code can tell you, is a commendable effort. 40 F.4th at 1066 (opinion of Bumatay, J.). In fact, the streamlined formulation mirrors this Court's own description of the 1917 Act, which is further evidence that Congress was engaged in a cleanup project, not a renovation. See United States v. Lem Hoy, 330 U.S. 724, 727, 67 S.Ct. 1004, 91 L.Ed. 1204 (1947) (explaining that the 1917 Act barred contract laborers, defined as persons induced or encouraged to come to this country by offers or promises of employment (emphasis added)), id., at 731, 67 S.Ct. 1004 (describing the 1917 Act as a prohibition against employers inducing laborers to enter the country (emphasis added)). And critically, the terms that Congress retained (encourage and induce) substantially overlap in meaning with the terms it omitted (assist and solicit). LaFave § 13.2(a). Clause (iv) is best understood as a continuation of the past, not a sharp break from it.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,69,"Hansen's primary counterargument is that clause (iv) is missing the necessary mens rea for solicitation and facilitation. Brief for Respondent 28-31. Both, as traditionally understood, require that the defendant specifically intend that a particular act be carried out. Supra, at 1940. Encourages or induces, however, is not modified by any express intent requirement. Because the text of clause (iv) lacks that essential element, Hansen protests, it cannot possibly be limited to either solicitation or facilitation.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,70,"Once again, Hansen ignores the longstanding history of these words. When Congress transplants a common-law term, the `old soil' comes with it. Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. 1795, 1797-1801, 204 L.Ed.2d 129 (2019). So when Congress placed encourages and induces in clause (iv), the traditional intent associated with solicitation and facilitation was part of the package. That, in fact, is precisely how the federal aiding-and-abetting statute works. It contains no express mens rea requirement, providing only that a person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures a federal offense is punishable as a principal. 18 U.S.C. § 2(a). Yet, consistent with a centuries-old view of culpability, we have held that  the statute implicitly incorporates the traditional state of mind required for aiding and abetting. Rosemond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,71,"Clause (iv) is situated among other provisions that work the same way. Consider those that immediately follow it: The first makes it a crime to engage in any conspiracy to commit any of the preceding acts, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(I), and the second makes it a crime to aid or abet the commission of any of the preceding acts, § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II). Neither of these clauses explicitly states an intent requirement. Yet both conspiracy and aiding and abetting are familiar common-law offenses that contain a particular mens rea. See Rosemond, 572 U.S. at 76, 134 S.Ct. 1240 (aiding and abetting), Ocasio v. United States, 578 U.S. 282, 287-288, 136 S.Ct. 1423, 194 L.Ed.2d 520 (2016) (conspiracy). Take an obvious example: If the words aids or abets in clause (v)(II) were considered in a vacuum, they could be read to cover a person who inadvertently helps another commit a § 1324(a)(1)(A) offense. But a prosecutor who tried to bring such a case would not succeed. Why? Because aiding and abetting implicitly carries a mens rea requirement—the defendant generally must intend to facilitate the commission of a crime. LaFave § 13.2(b). Since encourages or induces in clause (iv) draws on the same common-law principles, it too incorporates them implicitly.2",Barrett,0,
2022-041,72,"Still, Hansen reiterates that if Congress had wanted to require intent, it could easily have said so—as it did elsewhere in clause (iv). The provision requires that the defendant encourage or induce an unlawful act and that the defendant know or recklessly disregard the fact that the act encouraged is or will be in violation of law. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv). Yet while Congress spelled out this requirement, it included no express mens rea element for encourages or induces. Indeed, Hansen continues, the statute used to require that the encouragement or inducement be committed willfully or knowingly, but Congress deleted those words in 1986. Brief for Respondent 30. Taken together, Hansen says, this evidence reflects that Congress aimed to make a defendant liable for encouraging or inducing without respect to her state of mind.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,73,"But there is a simple explanation for why encourages or induces is not modified by an express mens rea requirement: There is no need for it. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, encourage and induce, as terms of art, carry the usual attributes of solicitation and facilitation —including, once again, the traditional mens rea. Congress might have rightfully seen the express mens rea requirement as unnecessary and cut it in a further effort to streamline clause (iv). And in any event, the omission of the unnecessary modifier is certainly not enough to overcome the presumption of scienter that typically separates wrongful acts from `otherwise innocent conduct.'

Many criminal statutes do not require knowledge of illegality, but rather only `factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.' Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 192, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998). So Congress's choice to specify a mental state for this element tells us something that we might not normally infer, whereas the inclusion of a mens rea requirement for encourages or induces would add nothing.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,76,"It bears emphasis that even if the Government's reading were not the best one, the interpretation is at least `fairly possible'—so the canon of constitutional avoidance would still counsel us to adopt it.

But Hansen presses the clause toward the most expansive reading possible, effectively asking us to apply a canon of `constitutional collision.' 40 F.4th at 1059 (opinion of Bumatay, J.). This tactic is understandable in light of the odd incentives created by the overbreadth doctrine, but it is also wrong. When legislation and the Constitution brush up against each other, our task is to seek harmony, not to manufacture conflict.3",Barrett,0,
2022-041,78,"Section 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) reaches no further than the purposeful solicitation and facilitation of specific acts known to violate federal law.

2022-041,79,"Start with clause (iv)'s valid reach. Hansen does not dispute that the provision encompasses a great deal of nonexpressive conduct—which does not implicate the First Amendment at all. Brief for Respondent 22-23. Consider just a few examples: smuggling noncitizens into the country, see United States v. Okatan, 728 F.3d 111, 113-114 (C.A.2 2013), United States v. Yoshida, 303 F.3d 1145, 1148-1151 (C.A.9 2002), providing counterfeit immigration documents, see United States v. Tracy, 456 Fed.Appx. 267, 269-270 (C.A.4 2011) (per curiam), United States v. Castillo-Felix, 539 F.2d 9, 11 (C.A.9 1976), and issuing fraudulent Social Security numbers to noncitizens, see Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1295-1297 (C.A.11 2010). A brief survey of the Federal Reporter confirms that these are heartland clause (iv) prosecutions. See 40 F.4th at 1072 (opinion of Bumatay, J.) (listing additional examples, including arranging fraudulent marriages and transporting noncitizens on boats). So the plainly legitimate sweep of the provision is extensive.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,80,"When we turn to the other side of the ledger, we find it pretty much blank. Hansen fails to identify a single prosecution for ostensibly protected expression in the 70  years since Congress enacted clause (iv)'s immediate predecessor. Instead, he offers a string of hypotheticals, all premised on the expansive ordinary meanings of encourage and induce. In his view, clause (iv) would punish the author of an op-ed criticizing the immigration system, a minister who welcomes undocumented people into the congregation and expresses the community's love and support, and a government official who instructs undocumented members of the community to shelter in place during a natural disaster. Brief for Respondent 16-19. Yet none of Hansen's examples are filtered through the elements of solicitation or facilitation— most importantly, the requirement (which we again repeat) that a defendant intend to bring about a specific result. See, e.g., Rosemond, 572 U.S. at 76, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Clause (iv) does not have the scope Hansen claims, so it does not produce the horribles he parades.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,81,"To the extent that clause (iv) reaches any speech, it stretches no further than speech integral to unlawful conduct.4 It has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed. Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 502, 69 S.Ct. 684, 93 L.Ed. 834 (1949). Speech intended to bring about a particular unlawful act has no social value, therefore, it is unprotected. Williams, 553 U.S. at 298, 128 S.Ct. 1830. We have applied this principle many times, including to the promotion of a particular piece of contraband, id., at 299, 128 S.Ct. 1830, solicitation of unlawful employment, Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 388, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973), and picketing with the sole, unlawful and immediate objective of inducing a target to violate the law, Giboney, 336 U.S. at 502, 69 S.Ct. 684. It applies to clause (iv) too.5",Barrett,0,
2022-041,82,"Hansen has no quibble with that conclusion to the extent that clause (iv) criminalizes speech that solicits or facilitates a criminal violation, like crossing the border unlawfully or remaining in the country while subject to a removal order. See §§ 1253(a), 1325(a), 1326(a). He agrees that these applications of §§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) are permissible—in fact, he concedes that he would lose if clause (iv) covered only solicitation and facilitation of criminal conduct. Tr. of Oral Arg. 61-62. But he resists the idea that the First Amendment permits Congress to criminalize speech that solicits or facilitates a civil violation—and some immigration violations are only civil. Brief for Respondent 38. For instance, residing in the  United States without lawful status is subject to the hefty penalty of removal, but it generally does not carry a criminal sentence. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 407, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012).",Barrett,0,
2022-041,83,"Call this the mismatch theory: Congress can impose criminal penalties on speech that solicits or facilitates a criminal violation and civil penalties on speech that solicits or facilitates a civil violation—but it cannot impose criminal penalties on speech that solicits or facilitates a civil violation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 62-63, Brief for Eugene Volokh as Amicus Curiae 5-7. If this theory is sound, then clause (iv) reaches some expression that is outside the speech-integral-to-unlawful-conduct exception. Of course, that speech is not categorically unprotected does not mean it is immune from regulation, but only that ordinary First Amendment scrutiny would apply. Brief for Respondent 44.",Barrett,0,
2022-041,84,"We need not address this novel theory, because even if Hansen is right, his overbreadth challenge fails. To succeed, he has to show that clause (iv)'s overbreadth is substantial  relative to its plainly legitimate sweep. Williams, 553 U.S. at 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830. As we have discussed, the provision has a wide legitimate reach insofar as it applies to nonexpressive conduct and speech soliciting or facilitating criminal violations of immigration law. Even assuming that clause (iv) reaches some protected speech, and even assuming that its application to all of that speech is unconstitutional, the ratio of unlawful-to-lawful applications is not lopsided enough to justify the strong medicine of facial invalidation for overbreadth. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). In other words, Hansen asks us to throw out too much of the good based on a speculative shot at the bad.

2022-041,91,"Yet, instead of applying Congress' duly enacted law to respondent, the Ninth Circuit held the statute unconstitutional under this Court's facial overbreadth doctrine. Specifically, it took the doctrine as license to speculate about imaginary cases and sift through an endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals, from which it concluded that the statute may be unconstitutional as applied to other (hypothetical) individuals in other (hypothetical) situations. 40 F.4th 1049, 1071 (2022) (Bumatay, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). It then tallied up those hypothetical constitutional violations and determined that they were substantial enough to warrant holding the law unconstitutional in toto. 25 F.4th at 1109-1111. That line of reasoning starkly demonstrates that this Court's facial overbreadth doctrine offers a license for federal courts to act as roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of the Nation's laws. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610-611, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (majority opinion of White, J.).",Thomas,0,
2022-041,92,"Such roving commissions are hardly a new idea. When they met in 1787, the Constitution's Framers were well aware of a body that wielded such power: the New York Council of Revision (Council). Created by the New York Constitution of 1777, the Council consisted of the Governor, the Chancellor, and the judges of the New York Supreme Court. 2 B. Poore, The Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws of the United States 1328, 1332 (2d ed. 1878). Noting that laws inconsistent with the spirit of this constitution, or with the public good, may be hastily and unadvisedly passed, section III of the New York Constitution required the two Houses of the New York Legislature to present all bills which have passed the senate and assembly to the council for their revisal and consideration. Ibid. The Council's power to revise legislation meant that, if it objected to any measure of a bill, it would return a detailed list of its objections to the legislature, which could change the bill to conform to those objections, override them by a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or simply let the bill die. J. Barry, Comment: The Council of Revision and the Limits of Judicial Power, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 235, 245 (1989) (Barry) (emphasis deleted).1 The grounds for the Council's vetoes ranged from an act being `inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution' to an act being passed without `the persons affected thereby having an opportunity of being heard' to an act being `inconsistent with the public good.' Id., at 245-246 (alteration and footnote omitted).",Thomas,0,
2022-041,93,"At first, the Council was a well-respected institution, and several prominent delegates to the Philadelphia Convention sought to replicate it in the Federal Constitution. Resolution 8 of the Virginia Plan proposed a federal council of revision composed of the Executive and a convenient number of the National Judiciary that would have authority to examine and  veto every act of the National Legislature before it shall operate. 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, § 8, p. 21 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (Farrand). The Council's veto would be final  unless the Act of the National Legislature be again passed. Ibid., see also J. Malcolm, Whatever the Judges Say It Is? The Founders and Judicial Review, 26 J. L. & Politics 1, 30-33 (2010).",Thomas,0,
2022-041,94,"The proponents of a council were clear that they sought to empower judges to pass upon not only the constitutionality of laws, but also their policy. One of the council's main supporters, James Wilson, stated that the council would share the New York Council's power of reviewing laws, not only on constitutional grounds, but also to determine if they were unjust, unwise, dangerous, or destructive. 2 Farrand 73. Such a power was needed, according to Wilson, because the ordinary judicial power of refusing to apply unconstitutional laws in cases or controversies did not include the authority to decline to give effect to a law on policy grounds. Ibid. The other leading proponent of a council, James Madison, similarly argued that the council would veto laws unwise in their principle, or incorrect in their form. 1 id., at 139. For Madison, the council was necessary to remedy the defect caused by the limits of judicial power: Judges could not prevent the pursuit of unwise & unjust measures. 2 id., at 74. In that vein, George Mason similarly argued that a council was needed to prevent unjust oppressive or pernicious laws from taking effect. Id., at 78.",Thomas,0,
2022-041,95,"Significantly, proponents of a council rejected the premise that judicial power included a power to refuse to apply a law for policy reasons. In fact, neither side thought judges would or should be authorized to make policy—whether couched in the language of justice or rights—through their exercise of the judicial power . The debate over a council of revision was made necessary  because  not a single delegate on either side of the debate proposed or supported having judges perform a policymaking role from the bench. J. Anderson, Learning From the Great Council of Revision Debate, 68 Rev. Politics 79, 99-100 (2006). From that shared premise, the council's proponents argued that such an institution was needed precisely because it would be incompatible with judicial duty to take policy concerns into account in adjudicating cases. See J. Mitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy, 104 Va. L. Rev. 933, 963 (2018).2",Thomas,0,
2022-041,96,"Despite the support of respected delegates like Wilson and Madison, the Convention voted against creating a federal council of revision on four different occasions. P. Hamburger, Law and Judicial Duty 511 (2008). No other proposal was considered and rejected so many times. Ibid. Like the council's supporters, opponents of the proposal understood that the judicial power is only the authority to resolve private disputes between particular parties, rather than matters affecting the general public. Barry 255. Working from that shared premise, they reasoned that it was `quite foreign from the nature of the judicial office to make them judges of the policy of public measures,' as `no maxim was better established' than that `the power of making ought to be kept  distinct from that of expounding, the law.' Ibid. (quoting 1 Farrand 97-98 (E. Gerry), 2 id., at 75 (C. Strong)), see also 1 id., at 140 (J. Dickinson). Indeed, opponents observed that the Judges were of all men the most unfit to have a veto on laws before their enactment. 2 id., at 80 (J. Rutledge). This was so not only because judges could not be presumed to possess any peculiar knowledge of the mere policy of public measures, id., at 73 (N. Ghorum), but also because, to preserve judicial integrity, they ought never to give their opinion on a law till it comes before them as an issue for decision in a concrete case or controversy, id., at 80 (J. Rutledge), see also Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. 92, 121, 135 S.Ct. 1199, 191 L.Ed.2d 186 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (Judicial involvement in such a council would foster internal biases). Opponents thus concluded that to include judges in the policy decisions inherent in the legislative process would be a dangerous innovation, one that would erode public confidence in their ability to perform their proper official character. 2 Farrand 75-76 (L. Martin), see also id., at 77 (The Supreme Judiciary should have the confidence of the people. This will soon be lost, if they are employed in the task of remonstrating against popular measures of the Legislature).",Thomas,0,
2022-041,97,"The later history of the New York Council of Revision demonstrates the wisdom of the Framers' decision. The Council naturally became politicized through its intrusive involvement in the legislative process. Over the course of its existence, it returned 169 bills to the legislature, the legislature, in turn, overrode only 51 of those vetoes and reenacted at least 26 bills with modifications. Barry 245. Moreover, the Council did not shrink from tough stands on controversial or politically charged issues. Id., at 246. For example, early in its existence, it vetoed a bill barring those convicted of adultery from remarrying and one that declared Loyalists aliens. Ibid. Decades later, it very nearly blocked the bill authorizing the Erie Canal's construction for policy reasons. P. Bernstein, Wedding of the Waters: The Erie Canal and the Making of a Great Nation 197-199 (2005). Some members of the Council opposed the bill due to concerns about committing the state to this huge project before public opinion was more clearly and more emphatically in favor. Id., at 198. Others were concerned that the legislation gave the canal commission arbitrary powers. Ibid. The canal legislation—one of the most important measures in the Nation's history—survived the Council's review only because Chancellor James Kent changed his deciding vote at the last minute, seemingly on a whim. Id., at 199.",Thomas,0,
2022-041,98,"The Council contributed to its own abolition in 1820, when it vetoed a bill passed by the legislature that called for a convention to revise New York's Constitution. 1 C. Lincoln, The Constitutional History of New York 623-626 (1906) (Lincoln). The State Assembly then issued a report lambasting the Council for usurping the legislature's role as the democratic representative of the people, the legislature subsequently enacted a new bill that succeeded in calling for a constitutional convention. Barry 247, Lincoln 626-629. The same sentiment arose at the convention when, echoing arguments that had also been made in Philadelphia against a federal council of revision, opponents of the Council argued that it had `usurped the power of judging the expediency as well as the constitutionality of bills passed by the legislature' and that it had `in fact become a third branch of the legislature.'

2022-041,100,"When courts apply the facial overbreadth doctrine, they function in a manner strikingly similar to the federal council of revision that the Framers rejected. The doctrine contemplates that courts can declare laws unconstitutional in the abstract without the law ever being applied against any individual in an unconstitutional manner. Along the way, courts must examine the sum total of the law's application to people who are not parties to any proceeding, courts then weigh the law's various applications to determine if any unconstitutional applications outweigh the law's constitutional sweep or might chill protected speech. That is nothing short of a society-wide policy determination of the sort that legislatures perform. Yet, the Court has never even attempted to ground this doctrine in the text or history of the First Amendment. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S., at ___ _ ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1584 (concurring opinion).

But the majority departs from ordinary principles of statutory interpretation to reach that result. Specifically, it rewrites the provision's text to include elements that Congress once adopted but later removed as part of its incremental expansion of this particular criminal law over the last century.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,104,"It is neither our job nor our prerogative to retrofit federal statutes in a manner  patently inconsistent with Congress's choices. Moreover, by acquiescing to the Government's newly minted pitch to narrow this statute in order to save it,1 the majority undermines the goal of the overbreadth doctrine, which aims to keep overly broad statutes off the books in order to avoid chilling constitutionally protected speech. See Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486-487, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965).

For ease of reference, I will refer to this as the encouragement provision.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,107,"Respondent Hansen argues that the encouragement provision is unconstitutional under our First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, and the Ninth Circuit below agreed. Neither the Government nor the majority disputes that conclusion if the statute is read according to its plain terms. And, indeed, when read literally, the encouragement provision prohibits so much protected speech that it appears to qualify as overbroad under our precedents.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,109,"A statute is overbroad—and thus facially invalid—if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The overbreadth inquiry thus generally requires comparing the First Amendment protected expression that a statute impermissibly punishes, on the one hand (let's call that category one), with the unprotected speech and conduct that the statute validly prohibits, on the other (category two).",Jackson,0,
2022-041,110,"Starting with category one: With respect to the sweep of the plain text of the encouragement provision, there is no dispute that, in ordinary parlance, `induce' means `to lead on, to influence, to prevail on, to move by persuasion or influence,' and `encourage' means to `inspire with courage, spirit, or hope.' Ante, at 1942. Thus, on its face, the encouragement provision's use of the terms encourage and induce seems to encompass any and all speech that merely persuades, influences, or inspires a noncitizen to come to, enter, or reside in this country in violation of law.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,111,"If speech of this nature is, in fact, sufficient to trigger potential prosecution under this statute, the provision would put all manner of protected speech in the Government's prosecutorial crosshairs. It would reach, for example, the grandmother who says she misses her noncitizen grandchild, leading the grandchild to move illegally to the United States. It would also apply to the doctor who informs a noncitizen patient that a necessary medical treatment is more readily available in the United States, influencing the patient to stay beyond the expiration of his visa to await treatment. The college counselor who advises an undocumented student that she can obtain a private scholarship to attend college in the United States, inspiring the  student to reside here, would also fall within the scope of the statute.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,112,"The encouragement provision, on this broad reading, would also punish abstract advocacy of illegal conduct, even though such speech is plainly permissible under the First Amendment. For instance, the plain text of the statute appears to prohibit a person from saying to a noncitizen who has no authorization to reside here, I encourage you to live in the United States. But that speech is plainly protected. See United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 298-300, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008). In Williams, this Court explained that abstract advocacy of child pornography—including the phrase I encourage you to obtain child pornography—qualifies as protected speech, even though the recommendation of a particular piece of purported child pornography with the intent of initiating a transfer is properly proscribed by federal statute.

Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 253, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002) (The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it).",Jackson,0,
2022-041,114,"The Government does not dispute that the encouragement provision is unconstitutional as overbroad if it is read according to its plain text, thereby reaching these various fact patterns.

2022-041,118,"The majority contends that the encouragement provision uses `encourage' and `induce' in a specialized, criminal-law sense, under which those words are essentially synonymous with solicitation and  facilitation and carry certain narrowing features of those crimes. Ante, at 1941-1942. But that construction of the statute is untenable for the reasons that follow.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,120,"The majority starts its interpretation of the encouragement provision with some background on solicitation and facilitation, ante, at 1940, instead of addressing any of the terms in the encouragement provision itself. This is the first clue that the majority's statutory analysis is unusual. Ordinarily, we start with the text of the statute being interpreted. Yet the words solicitation and facilitation appear nowhere in the encouragement provision. (As the majority notes, facilitation is also called aiding and abetting, ibid.—another term that is absent from the encouragement provision.)",Jackson,0,
2022-041,121,"The majority goes on to explain that the terms that do appear in the encouragement provision—encourage and induce —are also often used (with other words) to define solicitation and facilitation. Ante, at 1940-1941. For example, the majority notes that one legal dictionary defines `abet' as `to encourage or set another on to commit a crime,' and it cites other legal dictionaries that also use encourage to define abet. Ante, at 1940-1941. Similarly, the majority observes that the federal ban on soliciting a crime of violence  penalizes those who `solicit, command, induce, or otherwise endeavor to persuade' another person `to engage in the unlawful conduct.' Ibid. Because the terms encourage and induce are used to define the crimes of solicitation and facilitation, the majority concludes that the statutory terms `encourage' and `induce' have well-established legal meanings that incorporate common-law liability for solicitation or facilitation. Ante, at 1942.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,122,"This contention—that, because the broad terms that Congress actually used are sometimes spotted in the definition of other, narrower words, the statute's broad terms are limited by the meaning of those narrower words and those words' characteristics —is puzzling. The majority cites no precedent for this novel approach to interpreting words in a statute. And its logic falls apart in light of the English lexicon and how dictionary definitions tend to work.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,123,"Broad words are often used to define narrower ones. So the fact that a word is used to help define another word does not necessarily mean that the former is synonymous with the latter or incorporates all of its connotations. For instance, the word furniture might be used in the definition of a chair, but not all pieces of furniture are chairs, nor do all pieces of furniture have four legs or other common chair-like characteristics. Similarly, to move is used to define to walk, to run, and to fly. But that does not make these four terms interchangeable.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,124,"So, too, here. The phrase encourages or induces is not synonymous with solicits or facilitates (or aids and abets). For example, among the other characteristics of solicitation and facilitation (discussed further in Part II-C, infra) is the fact that they require an intent to bring about a particular unlawful act, ante, at 1940 (emphasis added). But the encouragement provision hints at no such thing. It simply prohibits encouraging or inducing a noncitizen to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv). Nor does the ordinary meaning of encourages or induces carry the intent requirement that solicitation and facilitation do: By describing the attractions of my hometown, for  instance, I might end up inducing a listener to move there, even if that was not my intent.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,125,It is also telling that the very next subdivision of § 1324(a)(1)(A) expressly prohibits aiding or abetting the commission of any of the preceding acts. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(II). That provision indicates that Congress knows how to create an aiding-and-abetting prohibition when it wants to—and that it did not do so in § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv).3,Jackson,0,
2022-041,126,The majority's mere observation that the encouragement provision's terms are used to define solicitation and facilitation is thus insufficient to establish that the terms mean the same thing or incorporate the same features.,Jackson,0,
2022-041,128,"The majority next turns to statutory history to support its transformation of the broad encouragement provision that Congress wrote into a narrow solicitation or aiding-and-abetting prohibition. Ante, at 1943. I agree that the history of a statute can reveal Congress's intent to use terms in a narrower or specialized manner. But, here again, the particulars matter. And the history of this particular statute only underscores that it cannot be read as the majority wishes. At every turn, Congress has sought to expand the reach of this criminal law, including by deleting the terms and mens rea requirement that the majority attempts to read back into the statute.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,130,"The history of the encouragement provision is a tale of expansion. Up first was an 1885 law focused specifically on contract labor. Ch. 164, 23 Stat. 332. It made knowingly assisting, encouraging or soliciting the migration or importation of a noncitizen into the United States to perform labor or service of any kind under contract or agreement unlawful. § 3, id., at 333. Congress revised this prohibition in 1917, to add induce. § 5, 39 Stat. 879. Thus, as of the early 20th century, it was a misdemeanor to induce, assist, encourage, or solicit  the importation or migration of any contract laborer, or to attempt to do the same. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,131,"Significantly for present purposes, in 1952, Congress deleted the statute's references to solicitation and assistance—leaving encourages and induces to stand alone. 66 Stat. 229. What is more, Congress expanded the prohibition to all unlawful entry, not merely contract labor. Ibid. And it also ratcheted up the punishment. Ibid. So amended, the statute made it a felony to willfully or knowingly encourage or induce, or attempt to encourage or induce, either directly or indirectly, the entry into the United States of any noncitizen who had not been duly admitted or who was not lawfully entitled to enter or reside within the United States. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,132,"Congress enacted the current version of the encouragement provision in 1986. It removed the mens rea requirement relating to the encouragement or inducement element—excising from the statute that a violator must willfully or knowingly encourage or induce a noncitizen to violate the immigration laws—while inserting a mens rea requirement for knowledge or reckless disregard of the noncitizen's immigration  status. See Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, § 112(a), 100 Stat. 3381-3382. Simultaneously, and for the first time, Congress made it a crime to encourage or induce an unauthorized noncitizen not merely to enter the United States, but also to encourage or induce such a person to reside here unlawfully. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,133,"Finally, in 1996, Congress crafted a separate penalty enhancement for certain kinds of violations. It raised the maximum punishment from 5 years to 10 years of imprisonment if the offender violates the encouragement provision for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain. § 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), see Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, § 203(a), 110 Stat. 3009-565.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,134,"As these developments illustrate, Congress has repeatedly revisited the scope of the encouragement provision. And, in so doing, it has consistently expanded the reach and severity of this criminal law from its modest 1885 origins. Most notably, the particular amendments that Congress has made to the encouragement provision demonstrate its intent to specifically reject the pillars of the majority's holding.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,135,"To reiterate: The terms solicit and assist appeared in the text of the statute between 1885 and 1952, at which point Congress removed them. Likewise, between 1952 and 1986, violating this statute required that the speaker willfully or knowingly encourage or induce a noncitizen to transgress the immigration laws. But in 1986, Congress deleted this primary mens rea requirement.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,137,The majority's efforts to spin the encouragement provision's enlightening enactment history in favor of the majority's narrow interpretation are unavailing.,Jackson,0,
2022-041,138,"The majority first points out that the 1885 version of the encouragement provision criminalized knowingly assisting, encouraging or soliciting certain immigration. § 3, 23 Stat. 333 (emphasis added), see ante, at 1943. Because the term encouraging was placed alongside assisting and soliciting in this precursor provision, the majority maintains that the term encouraging is narrowed by the canon of noscitur a sociis, which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated. Williams, 553 U.S. at 294, 128 S.Ct. 1830, see ante, at 1943. In Williams, the Court (in an opinion by Justice Scalia) reasoned that, when taken in isolation, the broad term `promotes' is susceptible of multiple and wideranging meanings, but that, in a list that includes `solicits,' `distributes,' and `advertises,' it is most sensibly read to mean the act of recommending purported child pornography to another person for his acquisition. 553 U.S. at 294-295, 128 S.Ct. 1830.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,139,"But, as the majority here ultimately goes on to acknowledge, ante, at 1943-1944, the statutory word encouraging was not actually accompanied by the narrower terms soliciting and assisting throughout the course of this statute's history. And for the history to be meaningfully referenced, the state of the statute must be considered over time, not just at particular points in which words that seem to support a particular reading might have appeared. The delta between the purportedly narrow version of the statute that the majority points to, and what later happened to the statutory text, is important— and there is no dispute that Congress later removed the terms soliciting and assisting from the encouragement provision, leaving encouraging and inducing to stand in isolation, 553 U.S. at 294, 128 S.Ct. 1830. See ante, at 1944. Tracing the  history over time clearly establishes that Congress deleted the very narrowing terms that the majority now reads back into the statute.4",Jackson,0,
2022-041,140,"The majority brushes off Congress's revision by speculating that Congress was merely engaged in a cleanup project and was just streamlining the statutory language. Ibid. This contention, however, gets our ordinary presumption in statutory interpretation cases precisely backwards. We usually presume differences in language convey differences in meaning, absent some indication from Congress to the contrary. BNSF R. Co. v. Loos, 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 893, 902, 203 L.Ed.2d 160 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we have found the presumption overcome where, for example, Congress has expressly billed the changes as effecting only `technical amendments.' Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 901.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,141,"Here, the majority points to no signal from Congress that it sought to change the encouragement provision's language without changing its meaning. It seems that the only support the majority can muster for its cleanup project theory is a 1947 Supreme Court case that at several points refers to the statute as a prohibition on encouraging or inducing certain unlawful immigration. Ante, at 1944 (citing United States v. Lem Hoy, 330 U.S. 724, 67 S.Ct. 1004, 91 L.Ed. 1204 (1947)). From this, the majority infers that, when Congress amended the encouragement provision five years later to remove the words solicit and assist, it must have been adopting Lem Hoy's shorthand characterization of the statute. But the majority fails to support this connection—tenuous on its face—with any evidence that Congress actually consulted our 1947 decision when it drafted the 1952 amendments, or anything else that might establish the primary significance that the majority ascribes to our decision's phrasing.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,142,"The majority similarly characterizes Congress's decision to remove the intent requirement from the statute in 1986 as a further effort to streamline the encouragement provision. Ante, at 1945. In other words, the Court today holds that Congress's removal of willfully or knowingly in the 1986 amendments did not change the mens rea required to violate this statute. But the majority offers no support at all for its view that Congress didn't really mean for the amendment to effect any substantive change. Instead, it conjures up its own simple explanation: There was no need for an explicit mens rea because encourage and induce carry the mens rea associated with solicitation and facilitation. Ante, at 1945, see also ante, at 1944 (reasoning that Congress's use of encourages and induces brought along the old soil of the traditional intent associated with solicitation and facilitation (internal quotation marks omitted)). Of course, this argument merely assumes that Congress intended for encourage and induce as they appear in the encouragement provision to mean solicit and facilitate, it is a repackaging of the majority's unwarranted  conflation of those terms. See Part II-A, supra.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,143,"The majority also invokes the presumption that a criminal law contains an intent requirement even where Congress does not explicitly include one. Ante, at 1945-1946. But, here, the statutory history undermines that presumption. Congress most certainly focused on the mens rea question because it not only decided to remove willfully or knowingly from the statute, it did so while inserting a separate mens rea requirement for the knowledge of the noncitizen's immigration status. The confluence of these choices implies that Congress's removal of the primary mens rea requirement was deliberate. And, when this deliberate choice is considered alongside the history of the provision's significant expansions, there is ample cause to think that Congress intended a substantive change in meaning.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,145,Other features of the encouragement provision (beyond its plain text and historical development) also suggest that Congress did not mean for the statute to be construed in accordance with established characteristics of solicitation or aiding and abetting. These features further highlight the poor fit between this statute and the narrow solicitation/aiding-and-abetting box into which the majority tries to squeeze Congress's broad language.,Jackson,0,
2022-041,146,"Recall that, in 1986, Congress made it a crime to encourage or induce a noncitizen not just to come to or enter the United States, but also to reside in this country. 100 Stat. 3382, supra, at 1956-1957.5 As the majority notes, while it is a crime for a noncitizen to enter the United States illegally, it is generally not a crime—just a civil violation—to remain in the United States without lawful status, such as when a noncitizen overstays a visitor or student visa. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 407, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012), see ante, at 1947-1948. Thus, the encouragement provision on its face appears to criminally punish someone who merely encourages or induces a civil violation.6",Jackson,0,
2022-041,147,"That feature of the provision does not sit easily with its categorization as a solicitation or facilitation statute, because, ordinarily, a person may only be held criminally liable for aiding and abetting or solicitation when the underlying offense is itself a crime. Aiding-and-abetting liability is a centuries-old view of culpability: that a person may be responsible for a crime he has not personally carried out if he helps another to complete its commission. Rosemond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70, 134 S.Ct. 1240,  188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014) (citing J. Hawley & M. McGregor, Criminal Law 81 (1899)), see also 18 U.S.C. § 2(a) (the general federal aiding-and-abetting statute, providing that someone who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures the commission of a federal crime is punishable as a principal). As for solicitation, at common law, the solicited offense had to be a felony or a serious misdemeanor, otherwise, the solicitor was guilty of no offense. 1 J. Ohlin, Wharton's Criminal Law § 9:2 (16th ed. 2021) (Wharton's). Today, in some jurisdictions, the offense solicited may be a felony or a misdemeanor, but in others, it can only be a felony—either way, though, the underlying offense must be criminal. Ibid. (footnotes omitted), see also 18 U.S.C. § 373 (the general federal solicitation statute, which is limited to the solicitation of violent felonies).",Jackson,0,
2022-041,148,"Here, by contrast, the encouragement provision on its face appears to permit a person to be punished as a felon for merely encouraging a civil violation. Thus, the statute is not an easy fit for the solicitation and facilitation role in which the majority has cast it.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,149,"This statute is fundamentally different from aiding-and-abetting liability and solicitation in other ways as well. As noted, aiding-and-abetting liability is a form of vicarious liability—i.e., a way in which a person becomes liable for the crimes of the principal. Likewise, for solicitation, the punishment  is usually geared to  the punishment provided for the offense solicited. Wharton's § 9:11, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 373(a) (providing, for example, punishment of not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment  of the crime solicited). But, notably, a person who violates the encouragement provision is not punished as if he were a principal of the underlying offense, nor does the prescribed punishment depend on the penalty for the underlying offense. So, for example, even if the underlying immigration offense is a civil violation, the person who encourages or induces that infraction could be punished by up to 10 years' imprisonment for violating the encouragement provision. Unlike solicitation and facilitation, then, punishment for violation of the encouragement provision is not tied in any way to the punishment prescribed for the underlying offense.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,150,"It is also telling that aiding-and-abetting liability (but not solicitation) requires that the principal actually commit the underlying offense. 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 13.3(c) (3d ed. 2018) (The guilt of the principal must be established at the trial of the accomplice as a part of the proof on the charge against the accomplice). Yet, the encouragement provision on its face does not require that a noncitizen actually enter or reside in the United States.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-041,151,"For these reasons, none of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation makes the encouragement provision readily susceptible to the majority's narrowing construction.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,153,"The majority nevertheless revises the statute, leaning on the canon of constitutional avoidance. Ante, at 1945-1946.7 But that canon comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual  analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 842, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). It does not give the Court license to rewrite a statute as it pleases. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 843. And, here, for the reasons explained above, it is clear that the majority has mounted a serious invasion of the legislative domain. Stevens, 559 U.S. at 481, 130 S.Ct. 1577 (internal quotation marks omitted). The majority's rescue mission is especially problematic because it is taking place in the context of a First Amendment challenge to a statute on overbreadth grounds, as explained below.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,155,"Overbreadth challenges are an exception to the usual rules governing standing, a variation the Court has long permitted in recognition of the danger of tolerating, in the area of First Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping and improper application. Dombrowski, 380 U.S. at 486-487, 85 S.Ct. 1116 (internal quotation marks omitted). Absent overbreadth doctrine, the contours of regulations that impinge on the freedom of speech would have to be hammered out case by case— and tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation. Id., at 487, 85 S.Ct. 1116. We thus allow defendants whose speech is constitutionally proscribed by a statute (like Hansen) to argue that the statute is nevertheless facially invalid under the First Amendment on the grounds that a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. Stevens, 559 U.S. at 473, 130 S.Ct. 1577 (internal quotation marks omitted). By permitting this kind of challenge, the Court has avoided making vindication of freedom of expression await the outcome of protracted litigation. Dombrowski, 380 U.S. at 487, 85 S.Ct. 1116.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,156,"If this Court is willing to redline Congress's work to save it from unconstitutionality, it sharply diminishes Congress's incentive to draft a narrowly tailored law in the first place, Stevens, 559 U.S. at 481, 130 S.Ct. 1577 (internal quotation marks omitted), which runs directly counter to overbreadth's goal of limiting criminal laws that chill constitutionally protected speech. Thus, in the particular context of an overbreadth challenge, countervailing constitutional concerns—namely, that constitutionally protected speech will be chilled—must be considered alongside the values that underpin our ordinary canon of constitutional avoidance.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,157,"Heavy reliance on constitutional avoidance where statutes would otherwise be facially overbroad also means that the broad language in the particular statute remains on the books—as compared to the alternative world, in which the Court holds the statute unconstitutional as facially overbroad and thereby prompts the enactment of a narrower replacement. Ordinary people confronted with the encouragement provision, for instance, will see only its broad, speech-chilling language. Even if they do consult this Court's decision, and do recognize that it substantially narrows the statute's scope, the Court's decision leaves many things about future potential prosecutions up in the air.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,158,"For example, one does not know from today's determination whether a noncitizen must actually complete the underlying offense of coming to, entering, or residing in the United States (à la aiding and abetting) or whether completion is not a prerequisite for prosecution (à la solicitation). This sort of uncertainty—the clarification  of which, by the way, should be Congress's policy prerogative—may itself dissuade people from engaging in protected speech.8 Thus, regardless of whether a potential speaker has the ability, means, and time to track down and interpret this decision (or hire a lawyer to do so) to understand what the law requires, the known unknowns of the majority's course portend further chill.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,160,"The majority attempts to downplay the encouragement provision's threat to free expression by highlighting that Hansen fails to identify a single prosecution for ostensibly protected expression in the 70 years since Congress enacted clause (iv)'s immediate predecessor. Ante, at 1946-1947. But the purported lack of past prosecutions provides no comfort for several reasons.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,161,"The first is that we have already said as much—this Court squarely rejected that kind of argument when the Government raised it in a prior overbreadth challenge. In Stevens, the Government vigorously asserted that it had never brought a prosecution implicating the kind of protected expression that the plain text of the statute in question swept in, and that it did not intend to do so. 559 U.S. at 480, 130 S.Ct. 1577. The Government hit this theme hard, invoking its prosecutorial discretion several times. Ibid. But we were not moved: Such a prosecution was permitted by the statute, we noted, and that was enough to make it a serious threat. The First Amendment protects against the Government, it does not leave us at the mercy of noblesse oblige. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,162,"Second, just as in Stevens, this prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in putting faith in Government representations of prosecutorial restraint. Ibid.At trial in this very case, the Government objected to Hansen's proposed jury instructions, which would have required, among other things, that the Government prove that Hansen intended the noncitizen in question to reside in the United States illegally. The Government's objection was telling. It was based on the argument that the proposed instructions added elements not found in the text of the statute itself. And the District Court was persuaded, it sided with the Government in that regard.9 But now that the statute's validity hangs in the balance, the Government has reversed course entirely—it now implores us to read into the statute the very element that it earlier opposed as atextual. See Brief for United States 23-28.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,163,"This debacle exemplifies the real and ever-present risk of continuing to have facially overbroad criminal statutes on the books. In its role as prosecutor, the Government often stakes out a maximalist position, only later to concede limits when the statute upon which it relies might be struck down entirely and the Government  finds itself on its back foot.10 I am not suggesting bad faith on anyone's part, these kinds of turnabouts might well be chalked up to institutional incentives and coordination challenges in a massive prosecutorial system. But given these dynamics, the answer to whether the Government has, as of today, prosecuted Hansen's hypothetical scenarios may understandably provide cold comfort to those living and working with immigrants.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,164,"In any event, it makes little sense for the number of unconstitutional prosecutions to be the litmus test for whether speech is being chilled by a facially overbroad statute. The number of people who have not exercised their right to speak out of fear of prosecution is, quite frankly, unknowable.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,165,"Moreover, criminal prosecutions are not the only method by which statutes can be wielded to chill free speech. Hansen's amici detail how Customs and Border Protection (CBP) relied on the encouragement provision to justify its creation of a watchlist of potential speakers that CBP had compiled in connection with its monitoring of a large group of migrants—a list that included journalists simply reporting factual information about the group's progress. Brief for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press as Amicus Curiae 5-6. CBP allegedly compiled dossiers on those reporters and singled them out as targets for special screenings. Ibid. There can be no doubt that this kind of Government surveillance—targeted at journalists reporting on an important topic of public concern, no less—tends to chill speech, even though it falls short of an actual prosecution.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,166,"Hansen's amici also describe how a group of Members of Congress recently sent a letter to three religious organizations that help undocumented immigrants, directing the organizations to preserve documents and communications related to their work in advance of a potential congressional investigation into whether such organizations are `harboring, transporting, and encouraging' noncitizens to settle unlawfully in this country. Brief for Religious Organizations as Amici Curiae 34 (emphasis added). Again, this kind of letter invoking the language of the encouragement provision can plainly chill speech, even though it is not a prosecution (and, for that matter, even if a formal investigation never materializes).",Jackson,0,
2022-041,167,"The majority nevertheless derides the fears of Hansen and his amici as an overimaginative parade of horribles. Ante, at 1947. But what may seem fanciful to this Court at great remove, ante, at 1939-1940, might well prove to be a significant obstacle for those on the ground who operate daily in the shadow of the law. The gravity of the encouragement provision's chilling effect is underscored by the filings of  amici curiae in support of Hansen—including briefs from lawyers, immigration advocacy organizations, religious and other charitable organizations, journalists, local governments, and nonprofit policy institutions from across the ideological spectrum. Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2373, 2388, 210 L.Ed.2d 716 (2021).",Jackson,0,
2022-041,168,"The substantial concerns that amici from such diverse walks of life raise illustrate that the deterrent effect feared by Hansen and his amici is real and pervasive. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2388.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,169,"Moreover, at the end of the day, those fears reflect a determination to view enacted statutes as serious business, and, essentially, to take Congress at its word. This Court should have done the same.",Jackson,0,
2022-041,170,"As written, the encouragement provision is overbroad. Therefore, it should have been deemed facially unconstitutional and invalid under the First Amendment, as the Ninth Circuit held.",Jackson,0,
2022-042,38,"In 1848, the United States won the Mexican-American War and acquired vast new territory from Mexico in what would become the American West. The Navajos lived within a discrete portion of that expansive and newly American territory. For the next two decades, however, the United States and the Navajos periodically waged war against one another. In 1868, the United States and the Navajos agreed to a peace treaty. In exchange for the Navajos' promise not to engage in further war, the United States established a large reservation for the Navajos in their original homeland  in the western United States. Under the 1868 treaty, the Navajo Reservation includes (among other things) the land, the minerals below the land's surface, and the timber on the land, as well as the right to use needed water on the reservation.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,39,"The question in this suit concerns reserved water rights—a shorthand for the water rights implicitly reserved to accomplish the purpose of the reservation. Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S. 128, 138, 96 S.Ct. 2062, 48 L.Ed.2d 523 (1976), see also Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-577, 28 S.Ct. 207, 52 L.Ed. 340 (1908). The Navajos' claim is not that the United States has interfered with their water access. Instead, the Navajos contend that the treaty requires the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajos—for example, by assessing the Tribe's water needs, developing a plan to secure the needed water, and potentially building pipelines, pumps, wells, or other water infrastructure—either to facilitate better access to water on the reservation or to transport off-reservation water onto the reservation. In light of the treaty's text and history, we conclude that the treaty does not require the United States to take those affirmative steps. And it is not the Judiciary's role to rewrite and update this 155-year-old treaty. Rather, Congress and the President may enact—and often have enacted—laws to assist the citizens of the western United States, including the Navajos, with their water needs.",Kavanaugh,0,

The Navajo Reservation is the geographically largest in the United States, spanning more than 17 million acres across the States of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. To put it in perspective, the Navajo Reservation is about the size of West Virginia.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,42,"Two treaties between the United States and the Navajo Tribe led to the establishment of the Navajo Reservation. After the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, the United States acquired control over massive new territory throughout what is now the western United States—spanning west from Texas through New Mexico and Arizona to California, and north into Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. The Navajos lived in a portion of that formerly Mexican territory.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,43,"In 1849, the United States entered into a treaty with the Navajos. See Treaty Between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians, Sept. 9, 1849, 9 Stat. 974 (ratified Sept. 24, 1850). In that 1849 treaty, the Navajo Tribe recognized that the Navajos were now within the jurisdiction of the United States, and the Navajos agreed to cease hostilities and to maintain perpetual peace with the United States.

2022-042,44,"Over the next two decades, however, the United States and the Navajos often were at war with one another. During that period, the United States forcibly moved many Navajos from their original homeland to a relatively barren area in New Mexico known as the Bosque Redondo Reservation.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,45,"In 1868, the two sides agreed to a second treaty to put an end to all war between the parties. The United States set apart a large reservation for the use and occupation of the Navajo tribe within the new American territory in the western United States. Treaty Between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians, June 1, 1868, 15 Stat. 667-668 (ratified Aug. 12, 1868). Importantly, the  reservation would be on the Navajos' original homeland, not the Bosque Redondo Reservation. The new reservation would enable the Navajos to once again become self-sufficient, a substantial improvement from the situation at Bosque Redondo. The United States also agreed (among other things) to build schools, a chapel, and other buildings, to provide teachers for at least 10 years, to supply seeds and agricultural implements for up to three years, and to provide funding for the purchase of sheep, goats, cattle, and corn.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,46,"In consideration of the advantages and benefits conferred on the Navajos by the United States in the 1868 treaty, the Navajos pledged not to engage in further war against the United States or other Indian tribes. Id., at 669-670. The Navajos also agreed to relinquish all right to occupy any territory outside their reservation— with the exception of certain rights to hunt. Id., at 670. The Navajos promised to make the reservation their permanent home. Id., at 671. In short, the treaty enabled the Navajos to live on their original land.

2022-042,47,"Under the 1868 treaty, the Navajo Reservation includes not only the land within the boundaries of the reservation, but also water rights. Under this Court's longstanding reserved water rights doctrine, sometimes referred to as the Winters doctrine, the Federal Government's reservation of land for an Indian tribe also implicitly reserves the right to use needed water from various sources—such as groundwater, rivers, streams, lakes, and springs—that arise on, border, cross, underlie, or are encompassed within the reservation. See Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-577, 28 S.Ct. 207, 52 L.Ed. 340 (1908), see also Cappaert v.

Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal parties. As relevant here, the Navajos asserted a breach-of-trust claim arising out of the 1868 treaty and sought to compel the Federal Defendants to determine the water required to meet the needs of the Navajos in Arizona and to devise a plan to meet those needs.

2022-042,57,"This suit involves water. To help meet their water needs, the Navajos obtain water from, among other sources, rivers, tributaries, springs, lakes, and aquifers on the reservation.

2022-042,58,"The Tribe asserts a breach-of-trust claim. To maintain such a claim here, the Tribe must establish, among other things, that the text of a treaty, statute, or regulation imposed certain duties on the United States. See United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 173-174, 177-178, 131 S.Ct. 2313, 180 L.Ed.2d 187 (2011), United States v.

The Federal Government owes judicially enforceable duties to a tribe only to the extent it expressly accepts those responsibilities. Jicarilla, 564 U.S. at 177, 131 S.Ct. 2313. Whether the Government has expressly accepted such obligations must train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing language in a treaty, statute, or regulation. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. at 506, 123 S.Ct. 1079. That requirement follows from separation of powers principles. As this Court recognized in Jicarilla, Congress and the President exercise the sovereign function of organizing and managing the Indian trust relationship. 564 U.S. at 175, 131 S.Ct. 2313. So the federal courts in turn must adhere to the text of the relevant law— here, the treaty.1",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,59,"In the Tribe's view, the 1868 treaty imposed a duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajos. With respect, the Tribe is incorrect. The 1868 treaty set apart a reservation for the use and occupation of the Navajo tribe. 15 Stat. 668. But it contained no rights-creating or duty-imposing language that imposed a duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. at 506, 123 S.Ct. 1079.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,60,"Notably, the 1868 treaty did impose a number of specific duties on the United States. Cf. Jicarilla, 564 U.S. at 184-185, 131 S.Ct. 2313. For example, the treaty required the United States to construct a number of buildings on the reservation, including schools, a chapel, a carpenter shop, and a blacksmith shop. 15 Stat. 668-669. The treaty also mandated that the United States provide teachers for the Navajos' schools for at least 10 years, and to provide articles of clothing or other goods to the Navajos. Id., at 669. And the treaty required the United States to supply seeds and agricultural implements for up to three years. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,61,"But the treaty said nothing about any affirmative duty for the United States to secure water. And as this Court has stated, Indian treaties cannot be rewritten or expanded beyond their clear terms. Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U.S. 423, 432, 63 S.Ct. 672, 87 L.Ed. 877 (1943), cf. Jicarilla, 564 U.S. at 173-174, 177-178, 131 S.Ct. 2313, Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. at  506-507, 123 S.Ct. 1079, Mitchell, 445 U.S. at 542, 546, 100 S.Ct. 1349. So it is here.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,62,"Moreover, it would be anomalous to conclude that the United States must take affirmative steps to secure water given that the United States has no similar duty with respect to the land on the reservation. For example, under the treaty, the United States has no duty to farm the land, mine the minerals, or harvest the timber on the reservation—or, for that matter, to build roads and bridges on the reservation. Cf. id., at 542-543. Just as there is no such duty with respect to the land, there likewise is no such duty with respect to the water.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,63,"To be sure, this Court's precedents have stated that the United States maintains a general trust relationship with Indian tribes, including the Navajos. Jicarilla, 564 U.S. at 176, 131 S.Ct. 2313. But as the Solicitor General explains, the United States is a sovereign, not a private trustee, meaning that Congress may style its relations with the Indians a trust without assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private trustee, creating a trust relationship that is limited or bare compared to a trust relationship between private parties at common law. Id., at 174, 131 S.Ct. 2313 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, unless Congress has created a conventional trust relationship with a tribe as to a particular trust asset, this Court will not apply common-law trust principles to infer duties not found in the text of a treaty, statute, or regulation. Id., at 178, 131 S.Ct. 2313. Here, nothing in the 1868 treaty establishes a conventional trust relationship with respect to water.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,64,"In short, the 1868 treaty did not impose a duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe—including the steps requested by the Navajos here, such as determining the water needs of the Tribe, providing an accounting, or developing a plan to secure the needed water.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,65,"Of course, it is not surprising that a treaty ratified in 1868 did not envision and provide for all of the Navajos' current water needs 155 years later, in 2023. Under the Constitution's separation of powers, Congress and the President may update the law to meet modern policy priorities and needs. To that end, Congress may enact—and often has enacted —legislation to address the modern water needs of Americans, including the Navajos, in the West. Indeed, Congress has authorized billions of dollars for water infrastructure for the Navajos. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 11, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 3230.2",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,66,"But it is not the Judiciary's role to update the law. And on this issue, it is particularly important that federal courts not do so. Allocating water in the arid regions of the American West is often a zero-sum situation. See Brief for Western Water Users and Trade Associations as Amici Curiae 13-14, 18-21. And the zero-sum reality of water in the West underscores that courts must stay in their proper constitutional lane and interpret the law (here, the treaty) according to its text and history, leaving to Congress and the President the responsibility to enact appropriations laws and to otherwise update federal law as they see fit in light of  the competing contemporary needs for water.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,68,The Navajo Tribe advances several other arguments in support of its claim that the 1868 treaty requires the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajos. None is persuasive.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,69,"First, the Navajos note that the text of the 1868 treaty established the Navajo Reservation as a permanent home. 15 Stat. 671. In the Tribe's view, that language means that the United States agreed to take affirmative steps to secure water. But that assertion finds no support in the treaty's text or history, or in any of this Court's precedents. The 1868 treaty granted a reservation to the Navajos and imposed a variety of specific obligations on the United States—for example, building schools and a chapel, providing teachers, and supplying seeds and agricultural implements. The reservation contains a number of water sources that the Navajos have used and continue to rely on. But as explained above, the 1868 treaty imposed no duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe. The 1868 treaty, as demonstrated by its text and history, helped to ensure that the Navajos could return to their original land. See Treaty Between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians With a Record of the Discussions That Led to Its Signing 2, 4, 10-11, 15 (1968).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,70,"Second, the Navajos rely on the provision of the 1868 treaty in which the United States agreed to provide the Tribe with certain seeds and agricultural implements for up to three years. 15 Stat. 669. In the Navajos' view, those seeds and implements would be unusable without water. But the reservation contains a number of water sources that the Navajos have used and continue to rely on. And the United States's duty to temporarily provide seeds and agricultural implements for three years did not include an additional duty to take affirmative steps to secure water, and to do so indefinitely into the future. If anything, the treaty's express requirement that the United States supply seeds and agricultural implements for a 3-year period —like the treaty's requirement that the United States build schools, a chapel, and the like—demonstrates that the United States and the Navajos knew how to impose specific affirmative duties on the United States when they wanted to do so.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,71,"Third, the Navajos refer to the lengthy Colorado River water rights litigation that unfolded in a series of cases decided by this Court from the 1960s to the early 2000s, and they note that the United States once opposed the intervention of the Navajos in that litigation. See Response of United States to Motion of Navajo Tribe To Intervene in Arizona v. California, O. T. 1961, No. 8, Orig. The Navajos point to the United States's opposition as evidence that the United States has control over the reserved water rights. According to the Navajos, the United States's purported control supports their view that the United States owes trust duties to the Navajos. But the Federal Government's liability on a breach-of-trust claim cannot be premised on control alone. United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U.S. 287, 301, 129 S.Ct. 1547, 173 L.Ed.2d 429 (2009). Again, the Federal Government must expressly accept trust responsibilities in a treaty, statute, or regulation that contains rights-creating or duty-imposing language. United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 177, 131 S.Ct. 2313, 180 L.Ed.2d 187 (2011), United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. 488, 506, 123 S.Ct. 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 60 (2003). The Navajos have not  identified anything of the sort. In addition, the Navajos may be able to assert the interests they claim in water rights litigation, including by seeking to intervene in cases that affect their claimed interests, and courts will then assess the Navajos' claims and motions as appropriate. See 28 U.S.C. § 1362, Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 615, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983), see also Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 784, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991), Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U.S. 463, 472-474, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976).3",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,72,"Fourth, the Tribe argues that, in 1868, the Navajos would have understood the treaty to mean that the United States must take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe. But the text of the treaty says nothing to that effect. And the historical record does not suggest that the United States agreed to undertake affirmative efforts to secure water for the Navajos— any more than the United States agreed to farm land, mine minerals, harvest timber, build roads, or construct bridges on the reservation. The record of the treaty negotiations makes no mention of any water-related obligations of the United States at all. See Treaty Between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians With a Record of the Discussions That Led to Its Signing.4* * *",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,73,"The 1868 treaty reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation. See Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-577, 28 S.Ct. 207, 52 L.Ed. 340 (1908). But the treaty did not require the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe. We reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,74,It is so ordered.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-042,75,"Justice THOMAS, concurring.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,76,"I join the Court's opinion in full, but write separately to highlight an additional and troubling aspect of this suit. For decades, this Court has referred to a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 225, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983), see also Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 296-297, 62 S.Ct. 1049, 86 L.Ed. 1480 (1942), Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. ___, ___, 143 S.Ct. 1609, 1628, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023). Here, in allowing the Navajo Nation's breach of trust claim to go forward, the Ninth Circuit appears to have understood that language as recognizing a generic legal duty of the Federal Government toward Indian tribes or, at least, as placing a thumb on the scale in favor of declaring that legal duties are owed to tribes. See 26 F.4th 794, 813 (2022). As the Court explains, the Nation has pointed to no source of legally enforceable  duties supporting its claim in this suit. But the Ninth Circuit's reasoning reflects deeper problems with this Court's frequent invocation of the Indian trust relationship.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,77,"At the outset, it should be noted that our precedents' trust language can be understood in two different ways. In one sense, the term trust could refer merely to the trust that Indians have placed in the Federal Government. If that is all this language means, then I have no objection. Many citizens (and foreign nations) trust the Federal Government to do the right thing. Determining how to do right by the competing interests of the country's millions of citizens, however, is generally a job for the political branches, not courts.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,78,"By contrast, the term trust also has a well-understood meaning at law: a relationship in which a trustee has legally enforceable duties to manage a discrete trust corpus for certain beneficiaries. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 2 (2001). At times, the Federal Government has expressly created such discrete legal trusts for Indians—by, for example, placing parcels of land or specified sums of money into trust. See, e.g., Cass County v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, 524 U.S. 103, 106-107, 114, 118 S.Ct. 1904, 141 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998) (describing statutory grants of authority to place lands in trust for Indians), Seminole Nation, 316 U.S. at 293-294, 62 S.Ct. 1049 (describing the Government's promise in a particular treaty to establish a $500,000 trust fund for the Seminole Nation). But, when resolving disputes about those trusts, the Court's trust language has gone beyond the discrete terms of those trusts, for example, the Court has alluded generally to the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in its dealings with Indians and the Government's moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust. Id., at 296-297, 62 S.Ct. 1049. In those and other cases, the Court has accordingly blurred the lines between the political branches' general moral obligations to Indians, on the one hand, and specific fiduciary obligations of the Federal Government that might be enforceable in court, on the other. See, e.g., Mitchell, 463 U.S. at 225, 103 S.Ct. 2961, Seminole Nation, 316 U.S. at 296-297, 62 S.Ct. 1049, see also Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1086 (CADC 2001), Shoshone Indian Tribe of Wind River Reservation v. United States, 364 F.3d 1339, 1348 (CA Fed. 2004).",Thomas,0,
2022-042,79,"In United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 131 S.Ct. 2313, 180 L.Ed.2d 187 (2011), the Court took steps to rectify this confusion. There, we explained that the Federal Government is not a private trustee but a sovereign, id., at 173-174, 131 S.Ct. 2313, and that the Government assumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute, id., at 177, 131 S.Ct. 2313. Accordingly, any legal trusts established or duties self-imposed by the Government for a tribe's benefit are defined and governed by statutes rather than the common law. Id., at 174, 131 S.Ct. 2313, see also id., at 173, 131 S.Ct. 2313 (emphasizing that `the general relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a private trust relationship'). The Court's opinion today represents a step in the same direction, making clear that tribes' legal claims against the Government must be based on specific provisions of positive law, not merely an amorphous trust relationship.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,80,"However, the Court has also invoked the trust relationship to shape at least two other areas of its Indian-law jurisprudence —with questionable results. For example, the Court has identified the unique  trust relationship with the Indians as the source of pro-Indian canons of construction that are supposedly applicable only in Indian law. County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U.S. 226, 247, 105 S.Ct. 1245, 84 L.Ed.2d 169 (1985), see also EEOC v. Karuk Tribe Housing Auth., 260 F.3d 1071, 1081 (CA9 2001) (refusing to apply the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to tribes in part because of those canons). But it is far from clear how such a trust relationship would support different interpretive tools. The first cases to apply those pro-Indian canons did not ground them in any trust relationship, but in the more basic idea that ambiguous treaty provisions should be construed against the drafting party. See, e.g., Patterson v. Jenks, 2 Pet. 216, 229, 27 U.S. 216, 7 L.Ed. 402 (1829), Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 552, 31 U.S. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832), The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 760, 18 L.Ed. 667 (1867), Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206 (1979), Restatement (First) of Contracts § 505 (1932). These canons then jumped without discussion from the interpretation of treaties to the interpretation of statutes in the 20th century. A. Barrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B. U. L. Rev. 109, 152 (2010). To this day, it remains unclear how the trust relationship could justify freestanding pro-Indian canons that authorize courts to depart from the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,81,"Next, the Court has also suggested that the trust relationship provides the Federal Government with an additional power, not enumerated in the Constitution, to do all that is required to protect Indians. Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 552, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Board of County Comm'rs v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705, 715-716, 63 S.Ct. 920, 87 L.Ed. 1094 (1943). In doing so, the Court has apparently used the trust relationship to feed into the so-called plenary power that Congress supposedly enjoys over Indian affairs. But the Court has also approved the use of that power to, among other things, restrict tribal sovereignty and eliminate tribal rights. See South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S. 329, 343, 118 S.Ct. 789, 139 L.Ed.2d 773 (1998), Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 501, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979), Haaland, 599 U. S., at ___, 143 S.Ct., at 1680-1681 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Accordingly, it is difficult to see how such a plenary power could be rooted in a trust relationship with Indians. And it seems at least slightly incongruous to use Indians' trust in the Government as both the basis for a power that can restrict tribal rights and canons of interpretation that favor Indians.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,82,"The influence of the trust relationship idea on these doctrinal areas is troubling, as the trust relationship appears to lack any real support in our constitutional system. See id., at ___ - ___, 143 S.Ct., at 1675-1676. The text of the Constitution (which mentions Indians only in the contexts of commerce and apportionment) is completely silent on any such trust relationship. See Art. I, §§ 2, 8, Amdt. 14, § 2. Further, the trust relationship does not have any historical basis. Its genesis is usually traced to this Court's statement in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 8 L.Ed. 25 (1831), that the relation of the United States to Indians has resembled that of a ward to his guardian, id., at 17, see also F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 2.022, p. 117 (2012) (Cohen). However, that statement was dicta, see Haaland, 599 U. S., at ___ - ___, 143 S.Ct., at 1674-1676 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), and, in any event, the Indian Tribe in  that case had a specific treaty calling for the Federal Government's protection, Cherokee Nation, 5 Pet. at 17. Some treaties with tribes have contained similar provisions, others have not. Compare Treaty With the Wyandots, 7 Stat. 31, with Treaty With the Mohawks, 7 Stat. 61. And, of course, some tribes before and after the Founding engaged in warfare with the Federal Government. Cohen § 1.032, at 36, id., § 1.033, at 40. In short, the idea of a generic trust relationship with all tribes—to say nothing of legally enforceable fiduciary duties—seems to lack a historical or constitutional basis.",Thomas,0,
2022-042,83,"In future cases, we should clarify the exact status of this amorphous and seemingly ungrounded trust relationship. As a start, it would be helpful to acknowledge that many of this Court's statements about the trust relationship were mere dicta. E.g., Seminole Nation, 316 U.S. at 293-294, 62 S.Ct. 1049 (discrete trust), Mancari, 417 U.S. at 551-552, 94 S.Ct. 2474 (equal protection challenge to Government hiring program), Seber, 318 U.S. at 707, 63 S.Ct. 920 (state taxes on Indian lands). In the meantime, however, the Court should take care to ensure that this confusion does not spill over into yet further areas of the law.",Thomas,0,

2022-042,85,"Today, the Court rejects a request the Navajo Nation never made. This case is not about compelling the federal government to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajos. Ante, at 1810. Respectfully, the relief the Tribe seeks is far more modest. Everyone agrees the Navajo received enforceable water rights by treaty. Everyone agrees the United States holds some of those water rights in trust on the Tribe's behalf. And everyone agrees the extent of those rights has never been assessed. Adding those pieces together, the Navajo have a simple ask: They want the United States to identify the water rights it holds for them. And if the United States has misappropriated the Navajo's water rights, the Tribe asks it to formulate a plan to stop doing so prospectively. Because there is nothing remarkable about any of this, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment and allow the Navajo's case to proceed.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,87,"Understanding this lawsuit requires at least three pieces of context the Court's opinion neglects. It requires some understanding of the history that led to the Treaty of 1868 establishing the Navajo Reservation. It requires some insight into the discussions that surrounded that Treaty. Finally, it requires an appreciation of the many steps the Navajo took to avoid this litigation.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,89,"For centuries, the Navajo inhabited a stretch of land in present-day northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, and the San Juan drainage beyond. J. Kessell, General Sherman and the Navajo Treaty of 1868: A Basic and Expedient Misunderstanding, 12 W. Hist. Q. 251, 253 (1981) (Kessell). This ancestral home was framed by four mountains and four rivers the Tribe considered sacred.

2022-042,90,"In the 1860s, that way of life changed forever. In the aftermath of the Mexican-American War—and following a period of rapid westward expansion—the United States found itself embroiled in a series of bitter conflicts with the Navajo. P. Iverson, Diné: A History of the Navajos 37-48 (2002) (Iverson). Eventually, the United States tasked James Henry Carleton with resolving them. Id., at 47-48. Determined to bring an end to Native resistance in the territory, he elected for a program of removal, isolation, and incarceration. Id., at 48. He hoped that time on a reservation would teach the Navajo `the art of peace,' and that, while confined, they might `acquire new habits, new values, new modes of life.' Id., at 49. In time, he imagined, `the old Indians will die off and carry with them the latent longings for murder and robbing, the young ones will take their places without these longings: and thus, little by little, they will become a happy and contented people.' Ibid. This vision found support from others in the federal government. As Commissioner of Indian Affairs William P. Dole put it in his annual report, the situation with the Navajo `demanded the earliest possible interposition of the military force of the government.' Ibid. In his view, only putting the Navajo on a `suitable reservation' would end their `wild and predatory life.' Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,91,"In settling on this plan, the federal government had goals in mind beyond reducing conflict. As Carleton explained, `by the subjugation and colonization of the Navajo Tribe we gain for civilization their whole country, which is much larger in extent than the State of Ohio, and, besides being the best pastoral region between the two oceans, is said to abound in the precious as well as other useful metals.' Id., at 50. The `exodus of this whole people from the land of their fathers' would be, he imagined, `a touching sight.' Ibid. But no matter. He saw it as the Navajo's `destiny' to `give way to the insatiable progress of our race.' Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,92,"Removal demanded finding a new home for the Tribe. Carleton picked the location himself: an area hundreds of miles from the Navajo's homeland commonly called the Bosque Redondo. Ibid., see also Kessell 254. Warning signs flashed from the start. Officers tasked with surveying the site cautioned that it was `remote' from viable `forage' and that `building material' would have to come from a significant distance. Iverson 50. Worse, they found that the water supply was meager and contained `much unhealthy mineral matter.' Ibid., see also Kessell 269. Carleton ignored these findings and charged ahead with his plan. Iverson 50.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,93,"That left the not-so-small matter of securing the Navajo's compliance. To that end, the federal government unleashed a maelstrom of destruction on the Tribe. Id., at 51. Before all was said and done, the Navajo had to be literally starved into surrender. 2 Hearing before the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, Office of General Counsel, Demographic and Socio-Economic Characteristics of the Navajo 6 (1973) (Commission Report). Thousands of U. S. troops roamed the Navajo Country destroying everything the Navajo could use, every field, storehouse, and hut was burned. Ibid. The campaign was brief, blunt, and, when combined with a particularly difficult winter, effective. Iverson 51. By the winter of 1863-1864, most of the Navajo had surrendered. Commission Report 6-7, see also Iverson 51.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,94,"That period of violence led to the Long Walk. In truth, it was not one walk but many—over 53 separate incidents, according to some. Id., at 52. In each case, federal officers rounded up tribal members, herded them into columns, and  marched them hundreds of miles from their home. Kessell 254. Many died en route, some shot by the souldiers. Commission Report 7. As one Navajo later recounted, people were killed `on the spot if they said they were tired or sick or if they stopped to help someone.' Iverson 55. Still others fell victim to slavers with the full complicity of the U. S. officials. Commission Report 7.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,95,"Those who survived wound up at a destination that surpassed their fears. Iverson 52. Bosque Redondo was just what the officers had warned: a semiarid, alkaline, fuel-stingy, insect-infested environment. Kessell 255. And, just as they predicted, water proved a serious issue. The Tribe was forced to rely on a `little stream winding through an immense plain.' Iverson 59. But its water was bad. Kessell 259. No surprise, then, that only half the land under cultivation at the Bosque was productive. Ibid. No surprise either that even the productive land yielded one disastrous crop failure after another. Id., at 255. Further feeding the crisis, Carleton badly underestimated the number of Navajos who would end up at the Bosque Redondo. Ibid. All told, the relocation proved a catastrophe for the Navajo, 2,000 died there in four years. Commission Report 8.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,97,"By 1868 even the U. S. government could see that the present conditions could not persist. Ibid. So it set out to relocate the Navajo once more. To that end, the United States sent members of the Indian Peace Commission to negotiate a new treaty with the Tribe. Kessell 257-258. Led by General William Tecumseh Sherman, the Commission disfavored allowing the Navajo to return to their homeland. Ibid. Doing that, the Commission feared, risked rekindling old hostilities. Id., at 257. So Sherman tried to persuade the Navajo to relocate someplace else. Understanding the importance of water to the Navajo, he offered them assurances that other locations would have plenty of water. Treaty Record 5.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,98,"The Navajo would have none of it. Their lead negotiator, Barboncito, refused to go to any other country except his own. Ibid. Any place else, he said, could turn out another Bosque Redondo. Id., at 5-6. Outside our own country, Barboncito told Sherman, we cannot raise a crop, but in it we can raise a crop almost anywhere. Id., at 3. We know this land does not like us, he said of Bosque Redondo, and neither does the water. Ibid. Along the way, he spoke of the heart of Navajo country, which he described as including a place where the water flows in abundance. Id., at 8. In the end, the will of the Navajos—personified in the intense resolve of Barboncito, won out. Kessell 259. Sherman came to realize that, if he left the Navajo at Bosque Redondo, the dire conditions —including `the foul character of the water'—would eventually induce them to drift away from the encampment. Id., at 260. And the Navajo flatly refused to move to some other unfamiliar place. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,99,"Arriving at that conclusion proved simple enough, arriving upon a treaty proved more challenging. There was, of course, no small power asymmetry. As one Senator noted at the time, it was a curious feature that the Commissioners set out to `conclude a treaty with Indians' who were at that very moment being `held on a reservation against their will.' Id., at 259. Language barriers presented complications too. Messages had to be translated twice— first from English to Spanish, and then from Spanish to Navajo. Id., at 261. Aggravating matters, the parties saw the world very differently. The United States'  representatives spoke of artificial lines on maps, of parallels and meridians, the Navajo spoke of geographical features, of canyons, mountains, and mesas. Ibid. The United States' representatives talked about ownership and a claim to the land, the Navajo talked about using the land. Ibid. As a result, the parties often misunderstood each other. Ibid. And whether intentionally or inadvertently, Sherman misled the Navajo about, among other things, the size of their reservation. Id., at 263. He promised twice the land that they received in the final accounting. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,100,"In the end, the Treaty of 1868 provided the Navajo less land per capita—two-thirds less—than the other Tribes the Indian Peace Commission would go on to negotiate with. Id., at 268. It seems that owed, in no small part, to the negotiators' understanding that the Navajo had already experienced irrigation agriculture and could plausibly get by with less. Ibid. Indeed, when providing instructions to the Indian Peace Commission about how they should negotiate with the Navajo, the Secretary of the Interior discussed the possibility of agriculture as bearing on the appropriate size of the Tribe's reservation. Unlike the Navajo, he thought, `wild Indians cannot at once be transformed into farmers. They must pass through the intermediate stage of herdsmen. They must first become pastoral, then agricultural.' Id., at 269.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,101,"Despite all this, for the Navajos the treaty signified not defeat, but victory, and not disappearance, but continuation. Iverson 36. The agreement allowed them to return to a portion of their home country. Ibid. Nor would that portion remain so confined. The Navajo often struggled to stay on the narrow tract of land the United States provided. Commission Report 9. In practice, the federal government often tolerated (and sometimes encouraged) the Navajo to live and tend to livestock off reservation to preserve their self-sufficiency. Kessell 271. These arrangements continued until the 1930s, when Congress first enacted legislation defining the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Reservation. Id., at 272. Over the ensuing decades, Congress would go on to extend the reservation's boundaries repeatedly. See, e.g., Act of June 14, 1934, 48 Stat. 960, Act of Feb. 21, 1931, ch. 269, 46 Stat. 1204, Act of May 23, 1930, ch. 317, 46 Stat. 378.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,103,"Fast forward to the present. Today, the Navajo Reservation has become the largest Indian reservation in the United States, with over 17 million acres, and over 300,000 members. App. 90. Its western boundary runs alongside a vast stretch of the Colorado River. Id., at 91. Yet even today, water remains a precious resource. Members of the Navajo Nation use around 7 gallons of water per day for all of their household needs—less than one-tenth the amount the average American household uses. Id., at 101. In some parts of the reservation, as much as 91% of Navajo households lack access to water. Id., at 102.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,104,"That deficit owes in part to the fact that no one has ever assessed what water rights the Navajo possess. For instance, although the Navajo Reservation is adjacent to the Colorado River, the Navajo Nation's rights to use water from the Colorado River have never been adjudicated. Id., at 36. The United States acknowledges that it holds certain water rights in trust for the Navajo. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 40. It does not dispute that it exercises considerable control over the disposition of water from the Colorado River. And it concedes that the Navajo's water rights may  include some portion of the mainstream of the Colorado. Id., at 33. But instead of  resolving what the Navajo's water rights might be, the United States has sometimes resisted efforts to answer that question.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,105,"The current legal regime governing the Colorado River began with a 1922 interstate compact between seven States. That agreement split the Colorado into two basins —an Upper Basin and a Lower Basin. See Colorado River Compact, Art. II, Colo. Rev. Stat. § 37-61-101 (2022). The compact answered some high-level questions about which States could lay claim to which sections of the river. But it did not purport to affect the obligations of the United States of America to Indian Tribes. Id., Art. VII. In that way, it left the Navajo with no insight into what water they could claim as their own.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,106,"Six years later, Congress entered the picture by passing the Boulder Canyon Project Act, 45 Stat. 1057, codified at 43 U.S.C. §§ 617-619b. That Act had a profound impact on the Lower Basin. It authorized the construction of the Hoover Dam and the creation of Lake Mead. § 617. More than that, it gave the Secretary of the Interior substantial power to divvy up the resulting impounded water. Failing agreement among the States in the region, the law authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts for the delivery of water and provided that no person may have water from the mainstream of the Colorado in the Lower Basin except by contract. § 617d, see also Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 565, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963) (Arizona I). In adopting this law, Congress hoped to put an end to the long-standing dispute over Colorado River waters.

2022-042,107,"Reality never quite caught up to the law's ambitions. After an agreement among the States failed to emerge and the Secretary began issuing contracts to various users, Arizona in 1952 brought an original action in this Court against California seeking a declaration of its water rights in the Lower Basin. Id., at 550-551, 83 S.Ct. 1468. Several other States intervened. Ibid. So did the United States. Ibid. In doing so, the federal government claimed the need to protect federal interests, including the rights of the Navajo Nation and twenty-four other Indian Tribes in the Lower Basin. App. 104. As the litigation unfolded, however, the Navajo began to worry that the United States did not have their best interests in mind. In 1956, the Navajo Nation sought leave to file (along with six other Tribes) a motion seeking to define the scope of the representation of the Tribes by the United States and objecting to what they considered a lack of effective representation and a conflict of interest.

2022-042,109,"Having seen enough, the Navajo in 1961 moved to intervene. Ibid. They argued that the United States had failed to vigorously assert their interests. Ibid. More than that, the Tribe contended, the United States had `abandoned the case so far as the adjudication of the rights of the Navajo Indians was concerned.' Ibid. The United States opposed the Tribe's motion. Ibid. On its view, it had already `undertaken representation of the interests of several Indian Tribes,' so there was no  need for the Court to hear from the Navajo. Id., at 107. In any event, the United States assured the Court, it would continue to apply `considerations of justice' in its dealings with the Tribe. Ibid. The government conceded, however, no evidence had been submitted on behalf of the Navajo Nation for uses from the mainstream. Ibid. And it conceded that such evidence would have had to be submitted in order for the Court to consider the issue of the Navajo Nation's rights to the mainstream. Ibid.

2022-042,110,"In 1964, the litigation Arizona initiated more than a decade earlier culminated in a decree. See Arizona v. California, 376 U.S. 340, 84 S.Ct. 755, 11 L.Ed.2d 757. It allocated the Lower Basin Colorado River mainstream among various parties—including five other Tribes whose interests the United States did assert. See id., at 344-345, 84 S.Ct. 755. The decree also permitted the federal government to release water pursuant to certain valid contracts and applicable federal laws. Id., at 343, 84 S.Ct. 755, Brief for Federal Parties 7. But the Tribe's rights remained in limbo. The United States never asserted any rights on the Navajo's behalf, the Navajo never received an opportunity to assert them for themselves. Since 1964, the decree governing the Lower Basin has been modified at various points. See, e.g., Arizona v. California, 547 U.S. 150, 126 S.Ct. 1543, 164 L.Ed.2d 271 (2006), Arizona v.

2022-042,112,"Unwilling to wait indefinitely, the Navajo eventually filed this suit. In it, the Navajo sought injunctive and declaratory relief to compel the Federal Defendants to determine the water required to meet the needs of the Nation's lands in Arizona and devise a plan to meet those needs to fulfill the promise of the United States to make the Nation's Reservation lands a permanent homeland for the Navajo people. Id., at 86. In other words, the Tribe asked the United States to assess what water rights it holds in trust on the Tribe's behalf pursuant to the Treaty of 1868. Tr. of Oral Arg. 71-72.

2022-042,114,"With a view of this history, the proper outcome of today's case follows directly. The Treaty of 1868 promises the Navajo a permanent home. Treaty Between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians, June 1, 1868, Art. XIII, 15 Stat. 671 (ratified Aug. 12, 1868) (Treaty of 1868). That promise—read in conjunction with other provisions in the Treaty, the history surrounding its enactment, and background principles of Indian law— secures for the Navajo some measure of water rights. Yet even today the extent of those water rights remains unadjudicated and therefore unknown. What is known is  that the United States holds some of the Tribe's water rights in trust. And it exercises control over many possible sources of water in which the Tribe may have rights, including the mainstream of the Colorado River. Accordingly, the government owes the Tribe a duty to manage the water it holds for the Tribe in a legally responsible manner. In this lawsuit, the Navajo ask the United States to fulfill part of that duty by assessing what water rights it holds for them. The government owes the Tribe at least that much.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,116,"Begin with the governing legal principles. Under our Constitution, all Treaties made are the supreme Law of the Land. Art. VI, cl. 2.

United States, 572 U.S. 844, 851, 855, 134 S.Ct. 2077, 189 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), and the Executive Branch can act in accordance with them, see, e.g., Fok Yung Yo v. United States, 185 U.S. 296, 303, 22 S.Ct. 686, 46 L.Ed. 917 (1902). But the Judiciary also has an important role to play. The Constitution extends the judicial Power to cases arising under  Treaties made, or which shall be made. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. As a result, this Court has recognized that Tribes may sue to enforce rights found in treaties. See Moe v.

In enacting the Indian Trust Asset Reform Act of 2016, Congress confirmed its belief that commitments made through written treaties with the Tribes established enduring and enforceable Federal obligations to them. 25 U.S.C. § 5601(4)-(5) (emphasis added).

2022-042,118,"That exercise entails the application of familiar principles of contract interpretation. Those principles include an implied covenant of the utmost good faith and fair dealing between the parties. Sullivan v. Kidd, 254 U.S. 433, 439, 41 S.Ct. 158, 65 L.Ed. 344 (1921). They include the doctrine of contra proferentem—the principle that any uncertainty in a contract should be construed against the drafting party. See Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. 1407, 1416-1418, 203 L.Ed.2d 636 (2019), see also 1 Oppenheim's International Law 1279 (R. Jennings & A. Watts eds., 9th ed. 1992). And they include the doctrine of unilateral mistake—the notion that, if two parties understand a key provision differently, the controlling meaning is the one held by the party that could not have anticipated the different meaning attached by the other. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 201(2) (1979).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,119,"Still other doctrines impose a higher degree of scrutiny on contracts made between parties sharing a fiduciary relationship, given the risk the fiduciary will (intentionally or otherwise) misuse its position of trust. 28 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 71:53, p. 617 (4th ed. 2020). When it comes to the United States, such fiduciary duties must, of course, come from positive law, not the atmosphere. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 143 S.Ct. 1609, 1628, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023). But the United States has, through acts of Congress and other affirmative conduct, voluntarily assumed certain specific fiduciary duties to the Tribes. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U.S. 286, 287, 297, 62 S.Ct. 1049, 86 L.Ed. 1480, 86 L.Ed. 1777 (1942). That raises the specter of undue influence—especially since, in many negotiations with the Tribes, the United States alone had representatives skilled in diplomacy who were masters of its written language, who fully understood the  technical estates known to its law, and who were assisted by an interpreter they employed. Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1, 11, 20 S.Ct. 1, 44 L.Ed. 49 (1899).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,120,"Put together, these insights have long influenced the interpretation of Indian treaties. The language used in treaties with the Indians should never be construed to their prejudice. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 582, 31 U.S. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832) (McLean, J., concurring). Rather, when a treaty's words are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain import, we must assign them that meaning. Ibid. Our duty, this Court has repeatedly explained, lies in interpreting Indian treaties in a spirit which generously recognizes the full obligation of this Nation. Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 684-685, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115 (1942), see also United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 380-381, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089 (1905), Choctaw Nation v. United States, 119 U.S. 1, 27-28, 7 S.Ct. 75, 30 L.Ed. 306 (1886). We sometimes call this interpretive maxim—really just a special application of ordinary contract-interpretation principles—the Indian canon. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 2.02, p. 119 (N. Newton ed. 2005), R. Collins, Never Construed to Their Prejudice: In Honor of David Getches, 84 U. Colo. L. Rev. 1, 6-7 (2013).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,121,"With time, too, these interpretive insights have yielded some more concrete rules. First, courts must give effect to the terms of treaties as the Indians themselves would have understood them. Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 196, 119 S.Ct. 1187, 143 L.Ed.2d 270 (1999), see also Tulee, 315 U.S. at 684, 62 S.Ct. 862. Second, to gain a complete view of the Tribes' understanding, courts may (and often must) look beyond the written words to the larger context that frames the Treaty. Mille Lacs Band, 526 U.S. at 196, 119 S.Ct. 1187. That includes taking stock of the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties. Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U.S. 423, 432, 63 S.Ct. 672, 87 L.Ed. 877 (1943). Third, courts must assume into those treaties a duty of good faith on the part of the United States to protect the Tribes and their ways of life. See Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.S. at 666-667, 99 S.Ct. 3055.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,122,"It is easy to see the purchase these rules have for reservation-creating treaties like the one at issue in this case. Treaties like that almost invariably designate property as a permanent home for the relevant Tribe. See McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2452, 2461, 207 L.Ed.2d 985 (2020). And the promise of a  permanent home necessarily implies certain benefits for the Tribe (and certain responsibilities for the United States). One set of those benefits and responsibilities concerns water. This Court long ago recognized as much in Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 28 S.Ct. 207, 52 L.Ed. 340 (1908).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,123,"That case involved the Milk River, which flows along the northern border of the Fort Belknap Reservation. Id., at 565-567, 28 S.Ct. 207 (statement of McKenna, J.). Upstream landowners invested their own resources to build dams and reservoirs which indirectly deprived the Tribes living on the reservation of water by reducing the volume available downstream. Id., at 567, 28 S.Ct. 207. The United States sued on the Tribes' behalf to enjoin the landowners' actions. Id., at 565, 28 S.Ct. 207. In assessing the government's claim, the Court looked to the agreement establishing that reservation and found no language speaking to the Tribes' water rights at all. Id., at 575-576, 28 S.Ct. 207. Nevertheless, the Court concluded, the agreement reserved water rights for the Tribes in the Milk River and found for the government. Id., at 577, 28 S.Ct. 207. The Court considered it inconceivable that, having once enjoyed beneficial use of nearby waters, the Tribes would have contracted to give up all that. Id., at 576, 28 S.Ct. 207. After all, the lands described in the reservation were arid and, without irrigation, were practically valueless, and communities could not be established without access to adequate water. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). For these reasons, the agreement's provisions designating the land as a permanent home for the Tribes necessarily implied that the Tribes would enjoy continued access to nearby sources of water. Ibid. A contrary reading, the Court said, would impair or defeat the parties' agreement. Id., at 577, 28 S.Ct. 207.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,124,"While Winters involved a claim brought by the United States, the federal government asserted the rights of the Indians themselves. Id., at 576, 28 S.Ct. 207. This Court's subsequent cases have confirmed as much. In United States v. Powers, 305 U.S. 527, 59 S.Ct. 344, 83 L.Ed. 330 (1939), for instance, this Court cited Winters as authority for its holding that a different treaty impliedly reserved waters for the equal benefit of tribal members. Id., at 532, 59 S.Ct. 344 (emphasis added). So when the reservation was dissolved and the land allotted, the right to use some portion of tribal waters essential for cultivation passed to the owners of the individual plots of land. Ibid. (emphasis added). Later, in Arizona I, this Court described Winters as standing for the principle that the Government, when it creates an Indian Reservation, intends to deal fairly with the Indians by reserving for them the waters without which their lands would have been useless. 373 U.S. at 600, 83 S.Ct. 1468 (emphasis added). Congress would not create an Indian Reservation without intending to reserve waters necessary to make the reservation livable. Id., at 559, 83 S.Ct. 1468.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,125,"Sometimes the United States may hold a Tribe's water rights in trust. When it does, this Court has recognized, the United States must manage those water rights as a fiduciary, Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 626-627, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983) (Arizona II), one held to the most exacting fiduciary standards, Seminole Nation, 316 U.S. at 297, 62 S.Ct. 1049. This is no special rule. Fiduciary duties characteristically attach to decisions that involve managing the assets and distributing the property of others. Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 231, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000). It follows, then, that a Tribe may bring an action in equity against the United States  for failing to provide an accurate accounting of the water rights it holds on a Tribe's behalf. United States v. Tohono O'odham Nation, 563 U.S. 307, 318, 131 S.Ct. 1723, 179 L.Ed.2d 723 (2011). After all, it is black-letter law that a plaintiff may seek an accounting whenever the defendant is a fiduciary who has been entrusted with property of some kind belonging to the plaintiff, even if the defendant is not expressly named a trustee. J. Eichengrun, Remedying the Remedy of Accounting, 60 Ind. L. J. 463, 468-469, and n. 18 (1985) (noting cases), see also A. Newman, G. Bogert, & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees § 967, p. 201 (3d ed. 2010) (fiduciary relationship is sufficient to support an action for an accounting whenever the fiduciary exercises discretion over trust assets).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,127,"With these principles in mind, return to the Navajo's case and start with the most basic terms of the parties' agreement. In signing the Treaty of 1868, the Navajo agreed to relinquish all right to occupy any territory outside their reservation. Art. IX, 15 Stat. 670. In exchange, the Navajo were entitled to make the reservation their permanent home. Art. XIII, id., at 671. Even standing alone, that language creates enforceable water rights under Winters. As both parties surely would have recognized, no people can make a permanent home without the ability to draw on adequate water. Otherwise, the Tribe's land would be practically valueless, defeating the declared purpose of the Treaty. Winters, 207 U.S. at 576-577, 28 S.Ct. 207.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,128,"Other clues make the point even more obvious. Various features of the Treaty were expressly keyed to an assumption about the availability of water. The United States agreed to build certain structures within said reservation, where  water may be convenient. Art. III, 15 Stat. 668. Under the Treaty's terms, too, individual Navajo were entitled to select tracts of land within the reservation to commence farming and for purposes of cultivation. Art. V, ibid. If an individual could show that he intended in good faith to commence cultivating the soil for a living, the Treaty entitled him to receive seeds and agricultural implements. Art. VII, id., at 669. Similarly, the Treaty promised large numbers of animals to the Tribe. Art. XII, id., at 670. Those guarantees take as a given that the Tribe could access water sufficient to live, tend crops, and raise animals in perpetuity.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,129,"As we have seen, the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties may also inform a treaty's interpretation. Choctaw Nation, 318 U.S. at 432, 63 S.Ct. 672. And here history is particularly telling. Much of the Navajo's plight at Bosque Redondo owed to both the lack of water and the poor quality of what water did exist. General Sherman appreciated this point and expressly raised the availability of water in his negotiations with the Tribe. Treaty Record 5. Doubtless, he did so because everyone had found the water at Bosque Redondo insufficient and because the Navajo's strong desire to return home rested in no small part on the availability of water there. Id., at 3, 8. Because the Treaty of 1868 must be read as the Navajo themselves would have understood it, Mille Lacs Band, 526 U.S. at 196, 119 S.Ct. 1187, it is impossible to conclude that water rights were not included. Really, few points appear to have been more central to both parties' dealings.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,130,"What water rights does the Treaty of 1868 secure to the Tribe? Remarkably, even today no one knows the answer. But at least we know the right question to ask:  How much is required to fulfill the purposes of the reservation that the Treaty of 1868 established? See Nevada v. United States, 463 U.S. 110, 116, n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2906, 77 L.Ed.2d 509 (1983) (citing cases). We know, too, that a Tribe's Winters rights are not necessarily limited to the water sources found within the corners of their reservation. Winters itself involved a challenge to the misappropriation of water by upstream landowners from a river that ran along the border of tribal lands. 207 U.S. at 576, 28 S.Ct. 207. And here the Navajo's Reservation likewise stands adjacent to a long stretch of the Colorado River flowing through both its Upper and Lower Basins. App. 91. Finally, we know that it is impossible to believe that when the Executive Department of this Nation created the various reservations in the arid Southwest it was unaware that water from the Colorado River would be essential to the life of the Indian people and to the animals they hunted and the crops they raised. Arizona I, 373 U.S. at 598-599, 83 S.Ct. 1468. Nor does the United States dispute any of this. To the contrary, it acknowledges that the Navajo's water rights very well may  include some portion of the mainstream of the Colorado that runs adjacent to their reservation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,131,"For our purposes today, that leaves just one question: Can the Tribe state a legally cognizable claim for relief asking the United States to assess what water rights they have? Not even the federal government seriously disputes that it acts as a fiduciary of the Tribes with respect to tribal waters it manages. Arizona II, 460 U.S. at 627-628, 103 S.Ct. 1382. Indeed, when it comes to the Navajo, the United States freely admits that it holds certain water rights for the Tribe in trust. Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. And of course, that must be so given that the United States exercises pervasive control over much water in the area, including in the adjacent Colorado River. See Arizona I, 373 U.S. at 564-565, 83 S.Ct. 1468.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,132,"Those observations suffice to resolve today's dispute. As we have seen, that exact coupling—a fiduciary relationship to a specific group and complete managerial control over the property of that group—gives rise to a duty to account. See supra, at 1827-1828. The United States, we know, must act in a legally adequate way when it comes to the Navajo's water it holds in trust. Arizona II, 460 U.S. at 627, 103 S.Ct. 1382. It follows, as the United States concedes, that the federal government could not legally dam off the water flowing to their Reservation, as doing so would interfere with the Tribe's exercise of their water rights. Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. Implicit in that concession is another. Because Winters rights belong to the Navajo themselves, the United States cannot lawfully divert them elsewhere—just as a lawyer cannot dispose of a client's property entrusted to him without permission. And the only way to ensure compliance with that obligation is to give the Tribe just what they request—an assessment of the water rights the federal government holds on the Tribe's behalf.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,134,"The Court does not dispute most of this. It agrees that the Navajo enjoy water rights implicitly reserved to accomplish the purpose of the reservation. Ante, at 1810. It agrees that the United States cannot lawfully interfere with those water rights. Ante, at 1810, 1812, 1812-1813. And it leaves open the possibility that the Navajo may be able to assert the interests they claim in water rights litigation. Ante, at 1816. Really, the Court gets off the train just one stop short. It insists (and then repeats—again and again) that the United States owes no affirmative duty to the  Navajo with respect to water, and therefore does not need to take any affirmative steps to help the Tribe on that score. Ante, at 1810, 1812-1816. This reasoning reflects three errors.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,136,"The Court begins by misapprehending the nature of the Navajo's complaint. Though it never quite cashes out what the phrase affirmative steps means, the Court appears concerned that allowing this complaint to proceed could result in a court order requiring the United States to build pipelines, pumps, wells, or other water infrastructure. Ante, at 1810, 1812, 1812-1813. More than that, the Court worries that—if a lower court finds that the United States has any water-related responsibilities to the Tribe—the federal government might even eventually find itself on the hook to farm land, mine minerals, harvest timber, build roads, or construct bridges on the reservation. Ante, at 1816, see also ante, at 1813-1814.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,137,"The Tribe's lawsuit asks for nothing of the sort. The Tribe expressly disavows any suggestion that, as a matter of treaty interpretation  the United States is legally obligated to pay for pipelines or aquifers, for example. Tr. of Oral Arg. 78. Instead and again, the Tribe's complaint seeks simply to compel the Federal Defendants to determine the water required to  fulfill the promises made to them under the Treaty of 1868. App. 86. Only if the United States is, in fact, interfering with their reserved water rights in some way, ante, at 1812, could the Tribe then ask the federal government to devise a plan for achieving compliance with its obligations, App. 86. And, for all anyone presently can tell, the United States may be interfering in just that way. Asking the federal government to assess what it holds in trust and to ensure that it is not misappropriating water that belongs to the Tribe has nothing to do with building pipelines or farming land.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,139,"Having mistaken the nature of the Navajo's complaint, the Court proceeds next to analyze it under the wrong legal framework. Citing cases like United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 131 S.Ct. 2313, 180 L.Ed.2d 187 (2011), United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. 488, 123 S.Ct. 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 60 (2003) (Navajo I), and United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) (Mitchell I), the Court tries to hammer a square peg (the Navajo's request) through a round hole (our Tucker Acts framework). See ante, at 1812-1814, and n. 1. To understand why those cases are inapposite, a little background is in order.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,140,"When an Indian Tribe seeks damages from the United States, it must usually proceed under the terms of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, and the Indian Tucker Act, § 1505. Together, those provisions facilitate suits for money damages in the Court of Federal Claims for claims arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States, or Executive orders of the President. Ibid. Notably, however, the Tucker Acts provide only a selective waiver of sovereign immunity, not a cause of action. To determine whether a Tribe can seek money damages on any given claim, this Court has laid out a two-part test. First, a court must ascertain whether there exists specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions, Navajo I, 537 U.S. at 506, 123 S.Ct. 1079, producing a scheme that bears the hallmarks of a more conventional fiduciary relationship, United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, 473, 123 S.Ct. 1126, 155 L.Ed.2d 40 (2003). Second, once a Tribe  has identified such a provision, the court must use trust principles to assess whether (and in what amount) the United States owes damages. United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U.S. 287, 301, 129 S.Ct. 1547, 173 L.Ed.2d 429 (2009) (Navajo II).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,141,"To describe this regime is to explain why the Court errs in relying on it. The Navajo do not bring a claim for money damages in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Acts (thereby implicating those Acts' selective waiver of sovereign immunity). Rather, the Navajo seek equitable relief in federal district court on a treaty claim governed by the familiar principles recounted above. See supra, at 1825-1828. They do so with the help of 28 U.S.C. § 1362, a provision enacted after the Tucker Acts that gives federal district courts original jurisdiction over civil actions brought by Tribes under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. Ibid., see also Brief for Historians as Amici Curiae 31. As this Court has noted, § 1362 serves to open the federal courts to the kind of claims that could have been brought by the United States as trustee, but for whatever reason were not so brought. Moe, 425 U.S. at 472, 96 S.Ct. 1634. That perfectly summarizes the claim that the Navajo advance here—a treaty-based claim bottomed on Winters that all agree the United States could bring in its capacity as a trustee. Nor does anyone question that the United States has waived sovereign immunity for claims seeking relief other than money damages based on an allegation that federal officials have acted or failed to act as the law requires. 5 U.S.C. § 702.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,142,"This Court's decisions have long recognized that claims for equitable relief in federal district court operate under a distinct framework than claims for money damages brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Acts. In United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) (Mitchell II), for example, the United States argued that the Court should not allow an action for damages under the Tucker Acts to proceed because the plaintiffs could have brought a separate action for declaratory, injunctive, or mandamus relief against the Secretary in federal district court. Id., at 227, 103 S.Ct. 2961. This Court agreed with the government's assessment that the plaintiffs could have brought a claim like that— even as it went on to hold that they were free to bring a damages action under the Tucker Acts framework too. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,143,"Lower courts have appreciated all this as well. As they have observed, nothing in the Tucker Acts or our decisions applying them implies that Tribes are not separately entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief under other laws or treaties and the traditional framework described above. Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1101 (CADC 2001), see also Loudner v. United States, 108 F.3d 896, 899 (CA8 1997). Consistent with this approach, they have frequently allowed Tribes to bring freestanding claims seeking to enforce treaty obligations —including water-related ones. See, e.g., Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians v. Morton, 354 F.Supp. 252, 256 (DDC 1973) (requiring the Secretary of the Interior to justify any diversion of water from the Tribe with precision), see also Northwest Sea Farms, Inc. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 931 F.Supp. 1515, 1520 (WD Wash. 1996) (In carrying out its fiduciary duty, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that Indian treaty rights are given full effect). The cases the Court relies on simply do not enter the picture.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,145,"After misreading the Navajo's request and applying the wrong analytical framework,  the Court errs in one last way. It reaches the wrong result even under this Court's Tucker Acts framework. The second step of the analysis—using trust principles to sort out the damages the United States owes, Navajo II, 556 U.S. at 301, 129 S.Ct. 1547—clearly has no purchase in this context. (Another tell that the Tucker Acts framework itself has no purchase.) But what about the first step? Historically, this Court's cases have distinguished between regulatory schemes that create bare trusts (that cannot sustain actions for damages) and a conventional trust (that can make the government liable in damages for breach under the Tucker Acts). White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. at 473-474, 123 S.Ct. 1126, see ante, at 1813-1814. A close look at those decisions suggests that, even under them, the Tribe's claim should be allowed to proceed.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,146,"Take Mitchell II as an example. There, this Court allowed a claim for money damages relating to the mismanagement of tribal forests. On what basis? A patchwork of statutes and regulations, along with some assorted representations by the Department of the Interior. 463 U.S. at 219-224, 103 S.Ct. 2961. In holding this showing sufficient to support an action for money damages, this Court observed that, where the Federal Government takes on or has control of property belonging to a Tribe, the necessary fiduciary relationship normally exists  even though nothing is said expressly about a trust or fiduciary connection. Id., at 225, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, where the federal government has full responsibility to manage a resource or elaborate control over that resource, the requisite fiduciary relationship necessarily arises. Id., at 224-225, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (emphasis added). Statements by the United States recognizing a fiduciary duty, the Court explained, can help confirm as much too. Id., at 224, 103 S.Ct. 2961.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,147,"Consider White Mountain Apache Tribe as well. There, this Court allowed a claim for money damages based on the United States' breach of its fiduciary duty to manage land and improvements on a reservation. 537 U.S. at 468, 123 S.Ct. 1126. The Tribe defended the right to bring that claim by pointing to a statute declaring certain lands would be `held by the United States in trust' for the Tribe and allowing the Secretary of the Interior to use `any part' of those lands `for administrative or school purposes.' Id., at 469, 123 S.Ct. 1126. In holding that statute sufficient to support a claim for money damages, this Court emphasized the United States exercised authority over the assets at issue and had considerable discretionary authority over their use.

2022-042,148,"Held even to these yardsticks, the Navajo's complaint easily measures up. Our Winters decisions recognize that the United States holds reserved water rights as a fiduciary for the Tribes. Arizona II, 460 U.S. at 627-628, 103 S.Ct. 1382 (emphasis added). The United States' control over adjacent water sources—including the Colorado River—is elaborate. Mitchell II, 463 U.S. at 225, 103 S.Ct. 2961, see also Arizona I, 373 U.S. at 564-565, 83 S.Ct. 1468, White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. at 475, 123 S.Ct. 1126. It can dole out water in parts of the Colorado by contract. 43 U.S.C. § 617d. And, of course, the United States has expressly acknowledged that it holds water rights in trust for the Navajo, see Brief for Federal Parties 37, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, perhaps including rights in the Colorado River mainstream, id., at 33. Given these features, the Navajo's complaint more than suffices to state a claim for relief.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,150,"Where do the Navajo go from here? To date, their efforts to find out what water rights the United States holds for them have produced an experience familiar to any American who has spent time at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Navajo have waited patiently for someone, anyone, to help them, only to be told (repeatedly) that they have been standing in the wrong line and must try another. To this day, the United States has never denied that the Navajo may have water rights in the mainstream of the Colorado River (and perhaps elsewhere) that it holds in trust for the Tribe. Instead, the government's constant refrain is that the Navajo can have all they ask for, they just need to go somewhere else and do something else first.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,151,"The Navajo have tried it all. They have written federal officials. They have moved this Court to clarify the United States' responsibilities when representing them. They have sought to intervene directly in water-related litigation. And when all of those efforts were rebuffed, they brought a claim seeking to compel the United States to make good on its treaty obligations by providing an accounting of what water rights it holds on their behalf. At each turn, they have received the same answer: Try again. When this routine first began in earnest, Elvis was still making his rounds on The Ed Sullivan Show.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-042,152,"If there is any silver lining here it may be this. While the Court finds the present complaint lacking because it understands it as seeking affirmative steps, the Court does not pass on other potential pleadings the Tribe might offer, such as those alleging direct interference with their water rights. Importantly, too, the Court recognizes that the Navajo may be able to assert the interests they claim in water rights litigation, including by seeking to intervene in cases that affect their claimed interests. Ante, at 1816. After today, it is hard to see how this Court (or any court) could ever again fairly deny a request from the Navajo to intervene in litigation over the Colorado River or other water sources to which they might have a claim. Principles of estoppel, if nothing else, may have something to say about the United States' ability to oppose requests like that moving forward. Cf. United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S. 11, 73-74, n. 97, 89 S.Ct. 773, 22 L.Ed.2d 44 (1969). All of which leaves the Navajo in a familiar spot. As they did at Bosque Redondo, they must again fight for themselves to secure their homeland and all that must necessarily come with it. Perhaps here, as there, some measure of justice will prevail in the end.",Gorsuch,0,

After receiving Coinbase's motion for a stay, the Ninth Circuit likewise declined to stay the District Court's proceedings.

By contrast, however, most other Courts of Appeals to address the question have held that a district court must stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on the question of arbitrability is ongoing.

2022-043,33,The sole question before this Court is whether a district court must stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. The answer is yes.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,34,"Section 16(a) does not say whether the district court proceedings must be stayed. But Congress enacted § 16(a) against a clear background principle prescribed by this Court's precedents: An appeal, including an interlocutory appeal, divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982). That Griggs principle reflects a longstanding tenet of American procedure. See Hovey v. McDonald, 109 U.S. 150, 157, 3 S.Ct. 136, 27 L.Ed. 888 (1883), see also Price v. Dunn, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1533, 1537, 204 L.Ed.2d 238 (2019) (THOMAS, J., joined by ALITO and GORSUCH, JJ., concurring in denial of certiorari) (describing Griggs principle as well settled), Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 379, 105 S.Ct. 1327, 84 L.Ed.2d 274 (1985) (In general, filing of a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,35,"The Griggs principle resolves this case. Because the question on appeal is whether the case belongs in arbitration or instead in the district court, the entire case is essentially involved in the appeal. 459  U.S. at 58, 103 S.Ct. 400. As Judge Easterbrook cogently explained, when a party appeals the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, whether the litigation may go forward in the district court is precisely what the court of appeals must decide. Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network, Inc., 128 F.3d 504, 506 (C.A.7 1997). Stated otherwise, the question of whether the case should be litigated in the district court  is the mirror image of the question presented on appeal. Id., at 505. Here, as elsewhere, it makes no sense for trial to go forward while the court of appeals cogitates on whether there should be one. Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F.2d 1335, 1338 (C.A.7 1989). In short, Griggs dictates that the district court must stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing.2",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,36,"Most courts of appeals to address the question in the § 16(a) context have reached that same conclusion. E.g., Blinco v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 366 F.3d 1249, 1253 (C.A.11 2004) (It makes little sense for the litigation to continue in the district court while the appeal is pending).3 Leading treatises agree that a district court should stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. For example, Moore's treatise states that a stay in these circumstances is the sounder approach and is consistent with the general Griggs principle that a district court should not exercise jurisdiction over those aspects of the case that are involved in the appeal. 19 J. Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Joseph, G. Vairo, & C. Varner, Moore's Federal Practice § 203.123a (3d ed. 2022). Similarly, the Wright and Miller treatise endorses the automatic stay requirement in arbitration cases. The treatise explains that a complete stay of district-court proceedings pending appeal from a refusal to order arbitration is desirable because continued trial-court proceedings pending appeal could lead to an entirely wasted trial if arbitration is ordered on appeal. 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3914.17, p. 7 (2d ed., Supp. 2022). In the Circuits that have considered the issue in the analogous contexts of qualified immunity and double jeopardy, moreover, district courts likewise must automatically stay their proceedings while the interlocutory appeal is ongoing.4 Similarly, as Bielski acknowledges, courts have held that the Griggs principle applies to those aspects of the case involved in a certified interlocutory  appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).5",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,37,"The common practice in § 16(a) cases, therefore, is for a district court to stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. That common practice reflects common sense. Absent an automatic stay of district court proceedings, Congress's decision in § 16(a) to afford a right to an interlocutory appeal would be largely nullified. If the district court could move forward with pre-trial and trial proceedings while the appeal on arbitrability was ongoing, then many of the asserted benefits of arbitration (efficiency, less expense, less intrusive discovery, and the like) would be irretrievably lost—even if the court of appeals later concluded that the case actually had belonged in arbitration all along. Absent a stay, parties also could be forced to settle to avoid the district court proceedings (including discovery and trial) that they contracted to avoid through arbitration. That potential for coercion is especially pronounced in class actions, where the possibility of colossal liability can lead to what Judge Friendly called blackmail settlements. H. Friendly, Federal Jurisdiction: A General View 120 (1973).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,38,"As Judge Easterbrook stated, continuation of proceedings in the district court largely defeats the point of the appeal. Bradford-Scott, 128 F.3d at 505. A right to interlocutory appeal of the arbitrability issue without an automatic stay of the district court proceedings is therefore like a lock without a key, a bat without a ball, a computer without a keyboard—in other words, not especially sensible.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,39,"From the Judiciary's institutional perspective, moreover, allowing a case to proceed simultaneously in the district court and the court of appeals creates the possibility that the district court will waste scarce judicial resources—which could be devoted to other pressing criminal or civil matters—on a dispute that will ultimately head to arbitration in any event. That scenario represents the worst possible outcome for parties and the courts: litigating a dispute in the district court only for the court of appeals to reverse and order the dispute arbitrated. Id., at 506. The Griggs rule avoids that detrimental result.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,40,"Importantly, Congress's longstanding practice both reflects and reinforces the Griggs rule. When Congress wants to authorize an interlocutory appeal and to automatically stay the district court proceedings during that appeal, Congress need not say anything about a stay. At least absent contrary indications, the background Griggs principle already requires an automatic stay of district court proceedings that relate to any aspect of the case involved in the appeal. By contrast, when Congress wants to authorize an interlocutory appeal, but not to automatically stay district court proceedings pending that appeal, Congress typically says so. Since the creation of the modern courts of appeals system in 1891, Congress has enacted multiple statutory non-stay provisions.6 Indeed,  Congress enacted a non-stay provision the day before enacting § 16(a) in 1988. See 102 Stat. 4120 (Neither the application for, nor the granting of, an appeal  shall stay proceedings in the Court of Veterans Appeals).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,41,"In short, the Griggs rule requires that a district court stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on the question of arbitrability is ongoing.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,43,"To overcome the Griggs principle, Bielski advances five main arguments. None is persuasive.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,44,"First, Bielski contends that an automatic stay would encourage frivolous appeals that would improperly delay district court proceedings. To begin with, Bielski has not established that frivolous appeals frequently occur in the Circuits that have long applied the Griggs principle in arbitration cases. Cf. Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc., 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 524, 531, 202 L.Ed.2d 480 (2019). Nor does Bielski argue that Coinbase's appeal in this case is frivolous. Importantly, moreover, the courts of appeals possess robust tools to prevent unwarranted delay and deter frivolous interlocutory appeals. For example, a party can ask the court of appeals to summarily affirm, to expedite an interlocutory appeal, or to dismiss the interlocutory appeal as frivolous. In addition, nearly every circuit has developed a process by which a district court itself may certify that an interlocutory appeal is frivolous. Brief for Petitioner 51, see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624, 629, 129 S.Ct. 1896, 173 L.Ed.2d 832 (2009) (Appellate courts can streamline the disposition of meritless claims and even authorize the district court's retention of a case when an appeal is certified as frivolous). Finally, a court of appeals may impose sanctions where appropriate, the possibility of sanctions also helps deter frivolous appeals. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 38, Arthur Andersen, 556 U.S. at 629, 129 S.Ct. 1896.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,45,"Second, Bielski contrasts § 16(a) with two other statutory provisions that contain an explicit stay requirement—§ 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act and § 1292(d)(4) of Title 28. Bielski suggests that Congress would not have included those explicit stay requirements in § 3 and § 1292(d)(4) unless Congress thought that an interlocutory appeal did not ordinarily stay district court proceedings. Bielski is wrong.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,46,"Section 3 of the Act provides for a stay of court proceedings pending arbitration, not pending an appeal. That situation does not fall within the Griggs rule. No background principle requires automatic stays of district court proceedings pending arbitration. In order to automatically stay court proceedings pending arbitration in those cases, Congress therefore affirmatively codified a stay requirement.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,47,"As to § 1292(d)(4): When Congress added § 1292(d)(4)'s stay requirement in 1988, the relevant subsection already contained a provision, § 1292(d)(3), that expressly made stays of proceedings in certain courts discretionary rather than mandatory. To avoid any misinterpretation of § 1292(d)(4) because of that preexisting language in § 1292(d)(3), Congress specified the right to an automatic stay pending appeal in § 1292(d)(4). That unusual circumstance does not diminish the operation of the Griggs rule in the context of arbitrability appeals.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,48,"Third, Bielski contends that requiring an automatic stay would create a special,  arbitration-preferring procedural rule. That is incorrect. In fact, Bielski's proposed approach would disfavor arbitration. Applying the Griggs rule here simply subjects arbitrability appeals to the same stay principles that courts apply in other analogous contexts where an interlocutory appeal is authorized, including qualified immunity and double jeopardy. Bielski further points to forum selection clauses as an analogy. But unlike § 16(a) arbitrability appeals, Congress has not created a right to an interlocutory appeal for cases involving forum selection clauses. So a stay in the forum selection context could be required only in those cases where there is a certified § 1292(b) interlocutory appeal of the forum selection issue.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,49,"Fourth, Bielski suggests that there is no need for an automatic stay because the ordinary discretionary stay factors would adequately protect parties' rights to an interlocutory appellate determination of arbitrability. To begin with, experience shows that Bielski is incorrect. District courts and courts of appeals applying the usual four-factor standard for a discretionary stay often deny stays in § 16(a) appeals because courts applying that test often do not consider litigation-related burdens (here, from the continued District Court proceedings) to constitute irreparable harm. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434-435, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009), FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 244, 101 S.Ct. 488, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980) (Mere litigation expense, even substantial and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable injury (internal quotation marks omitted)), App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a (District Court in Bielski stating that mere litigation expenses do not generally constitute irreparable injury for purposes of stay pending appeal). In any event, the background Griggs rule applies regardless of how often courts might otherwise grant stays under the ordinary discretionary stay factors.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,50,"Fifth, Bielski relies on this Court's statement that questions of arbitrability are severable from the merits of the underlying disputes. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 21, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). But the sole issue here is whether the district court's authority to consider a case is involved in the appeal when an appellate court considers the threshold question of arbitrability. Griggs, 459 U.S. at 58, 103 S.Ct. 400. The answer is yes, and Moses H. Cone says nothing to the contrary.* * *",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-043,51,"We conclude that, after Coinbase appealed from the denial of its motion to compel arbitration, the District Court was required to stay its proceedings. On remand, we anticipate that the Ninth Circuit here, as we anticipate in § 16(a) appeals more generally, will proceed with appropriate expedition when considering Coinbase's interlocutory appeal from the denial of the motion to compel arbitration. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.7",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-043,54,"When a federal court of appeals conducts interlocutory review of a trial court order, the rest of the case remains at the trial court level. Usually, the trial judge  then makes a particularized determination upon request, based on the facts and circumstances of that case, as to whether the remaining part of the case should continue unabated or be paused (stayed) pending appeal. This discretionary decisionmaking promotes procedural fairness because it allows for a balancing of all relevant interests. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,55,"Today, the Court departs from this traditional approach. It holds that, with respect to an interlocutory appeal of a trial court order denying arbitration, a trial court must always stay its pre-trial and trial proceedings while the interlocutory appeal is ongoing. Ante, at 1918. In other words, in this context, the Court sees fit to impose a mandatory general stay of trial court proceedings.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,56,"This mandatory-general-stay rule for interlocutory arbitrability appeals comes out of nowhere. No statute imposes it. Nor does any decision of this Court. Yet today's majority invents a new stay rule perpetually favoring one class of litigants—defendants seeking arbitration. Those defendants will now receive a stay even when, according to the usual equitable analysis, there is no good reason for one. And, in reaching this result, the Court concludes for the first time that an interlocutory appeal about one matter (arbitrability) bars the district court from proceeding on another (the merits). That logic has such significant implications for federal litigation that the majority itself shies away from the Pandora's box it may have opened.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,57,I see no basis here for wresting away the discretion traditionally entrusted to the judge closest to a case. I respectfully dissent.,Jackson,0,
2022-043,59,Congress did not impose the mandatory-general-stay rule that the majority adopts today.,Jackson,0,
2022-043,60,"Start with the governing statute. Congress addressed the kind of interlocutory appeals at issue here in 9 U.S.C. § 16—the section of the Federal Arbitration Act it enacted to govern Appeals. 102 Stat. 4671 (amending the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.). Section 16 provides that an appeal may be taken from specified orders and decisions, and an appeal may not be taken from others. The appeals that § 16 authorizes include interlocutory appeals of orders denying requests for arbitration. §§ 16(a)(1)(A)-(C).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,61,"But nowhere did Congress provide that such an interlocutory appeal automatically triggers a general stay of pretrial and trial proceedings. As the majority opinion admits, § 16 never even mentions a stay pending appeal. Ante, at 1919-1920.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,62,"Even beyond that, related provisions confirm that Congress imposed no mandatory general stay in § 16 appeals. Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. Nken, 556 U.S. at 430, 129 S.Ct. 1749 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Congress did that here—twice.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,63,"First, Congress expressly mandated a general interlocutory stay in another provision of the same 1988 law that enacted § 16. See 102 Stat. 4652, 4670-4671. Like § 16, that other provision—codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1292(d)(4)—authorizes interlocutory appeals. See § 1292(d)(4)(A). But unlike § 16, the text of that other provision specifies that, upon an interlocutory appeal, proceedings shall be  stayed until the appeal has been decided.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,64,"§ 1292(d)(4)(B). This resembles the rule the majority adopts today for § 16 appeals. Yet Congress omitted it from § 16, while simultaneously imposing it in § 1292(d)(4).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,65,"Second, Congress expressly mandated a general interlocutory stay in another provision of the Federal Arbitration Act. Section 3 pertains to a circumstance in which the trial court is satisfied that an issue should be referred to arbitration. 9 U.S.C. § 3. In such a case, the statute expressly provides that the trial court shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had. Ibid. (emphasis added). Again, the contrast with § 16 is stark. Congress specified a mandatory general stay of trial court proceedings in § 3 (when the trial court determines that arbitration is warranted) but not § 16(a) (when the court determines that arbitration is unwarranted).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,66,"The majority opinion waves away these mandatory-general-stay provisions by jerry-rigging explanations for why Congress mandated those stays expressly without doing so in § 16. Ante, at 1922-1923. But the point remains: Congress focused on stays when crafting the 1988 law and the Federal Arbitration Act. And when it intended to mandate interlocutory stays, said so expressly. Nothing stopped Congress from doing so in § 16—yet it chose not to. This underscores that § 16 does not mandate a stay.1",Jackson,0,
2022-043,67,"Given all this, it is no surprise that Congress's enactments barely figure into the majority opinion. The mandatory-general-stay rule is so untethered from § 16 that the statutory text has no role in the Court's reasoning.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,68,"And when Congress's work finally does take the stage near the end of the Court's analysis, it plays a minor part. See ante, at 1921-1922. The Court notes that other statutes expressly provide that appeals do not automatically stay district court proceedings. Ante, at 1921-1922, and n. 6. From this, the Court tries to draw an across-the-board inference that, unless Congress expressly disavows the majority's mandatory-general-stay rule, that rule applies.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,69,"The Court's inference fails. The statutes that the majority points to have nothing to do with arbitration or § 16 (unlike the two  provisions discussed above, which were enacted in the same 1988 law as § 16 and codified alongside § 16 in the Federal Arbitration Act, respectively, supra, at 1924-1925).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,70,"Moreover, and in any event, the majority's cited statutes do not support the majority's mandatory-general-stay rule. The majority invokes statutes that expressly preclude automatic stays of all trial court proceedings. But if the majority is correct that Congress intended the opposite when a statute is silent, then stays of all trial court proceedings would be required. Yet, the majority's own holding does not go that far. See ante, at 1920, n. 2. Instead, the majority requires stays for some proceedings (those related to the merits) but not others (those related to costs and fees), ibid.—a line that appears nowhere in the majority's cited statutes.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,71,"At the end of the day, the best the majority can do is point to a smattering of provisions that do not contain the rule that the majority adopts. And those provisions do not even relate to § 16 or the majority's rule (staying litigation generally but not proceedings on costs and fees). Neither those statutes, nor any other, imposes on arbitrability appeals the stay rule that the Court announces.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,73,"Unable to locate its rule in a statute, the majority opinion pivots to background principles. Ante, at 1919-1920. But there is no background mandatory-general-stay rule.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,74,"To the contrary, the background rule is that courts have case-by-case discretion regarding whether or not to issue a stay. The power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket. Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936). That power is discretionary —it calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing interests in each particular case. Id., at 254-255, 57 S.Ct. 163. One key to this discretionary-stay tradition is its suppleness of adaptation to varying conditions. Id., at 256, 57 S.Ct. 163. A stay is not a matter of right and cannot be imposed reflexively. Nken, 556 U.S. at 427, 129 S.Ct. 1749 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,75,"That has long been the default rule.

2022-043,76,"Significantly for present purposes, discretionary stays are the default for interlocutory appeals in particular—and this dates back to the first federal interlocutory-appeal statute in 1891. Judiciary Act of 1891, § 7, 26 Stat. 828, see 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3906, p. 346 (3d ed. 2022). There, Congress established that proceedings  in the court below shall not be stayed unless otherwise ordered by that court during the pendency of such appeal. § 7, 26 Stat. 828 (emphasis added).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,77,"That statute cemented a background discretionary-stay rule that governed even where Congress was silent—as this Court has repeatedly recognized. Shortly after the 1891 Act, a case arose under conditions in which the Act was silent about whether a stay should issue. In re Haberman Mfg. Co., 147 U.S. 525, 530, 13 S.Ct. 527, 37 L.Ed. 266 (1893) (finding no express provision on point). This Court applied the background rule: The Circuit Court had  a discretion to grant or refuse a stay. Ibid. Another case of statutory silence arose a few years later. In re McKenzie, 180 U.S. 536, 550-551, 21 S.Ct. 468, 45 L.Ed. 657 (1901). Again, this Court reiterated federal courts' inherent power  to stay or supersede proceedings on appeal from an interlocutory order. Id., at 551, 21 S.Ct. 468. As this Court summarized in yet another case, the rule is that the trial court has authority during an interlocutory appeal to take further proceedings in the cause, unless in its discretion it orders them to be stayed, pending the appeal. Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, 165 U.S. 518, 525, 17 S.Ct. 407, 41 L.Ed. 810 (1897). That authority is recognized by the 1891 Act but existed already as a traditional matter, often exercised by other courts of chancery. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,78,"This was the background against which Congress enacted § 16. And—importantly —courts understood stays as discretionary with respect to interlocutory appeals concerning arbitrability. Before Congress enacted § 16, parties brought interlocutory arbitrability appeals under other sources of appellate jurisdiction, and courts treated stays as discretionary, not mandatory.2 Yet, according to the majority, Congress sought to displace that common understanding when it enacted § 16—without saying anything at all about stays pending appeal.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,79,"Even setting all that aside, the majority opinion's reliance on a background rule, ante, at 1919-1920, still fails. The majority has not shown that its own rule (the mandatory-general-stay rule) existed as a background matter when Congress enacted § 16 in 1988. Indeed, the majority opinion does not identify a single case in which this Court imposed a mandatory general stay of pre-trial and trial proceedings pending an interlocutory appeal. Not in an arbitration case. Not in an analogous case about the proper adjudicatory forum for a dispute. Not in any interlocutory appeal at all.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,81,"Because neither the statute nor any background law states that an interlocutory appeal over arbitrability triggers a mandatory general stay of trial court proceedings, the majority opinion resorts to spinning such a rule from a single sentence in Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (per curiam). But Griggs expresses a far narrower principle, and is thus insufficient to support the majority's mandatory-general-stay rule.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,82,"Griggs stands for a modest proposition: Two courts should avoid exercising control over the same order or judgment simultaneously. The problem Griggs identifies is the danger a district court and a court of appeals would be simultaneously analyzing the same judgment. Id., at 59, 103 S.Ct. 400. The cure Griggs prescribes is that the filing of a notice of appeal  divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. Id., at 58, 103 S.Ct. 400.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,83,"And the reason is simple. Two courts simultaneously analyzing the same judgment could step on each other's toes. It would interfere with the appellate court's review of an order if the district court modified that order mid-appeal. Instead,  an order should be reviewed by one court at a time.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,84,"This notion of one order, one reviewing court is all that was at issue in Griggs. Griggs concerned a party that tried to appeal a judgment while the District Court was still considering whether to alter that same judgment. Id., at 56, 103 S.Ct. 400. The Court held that the appeal needed to wait until after the District Court's work on that judgment was done. Id., at 60-61, 103 S.Ct. 400. This result, which followed from the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, was necessary to avoid the situation in which district courts and courts of appeals would both have had the power to modify the same judgment. Id., at 60, 103 S.Ct. 400 (emphasis added).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,85,"Properly understood and applied here, Griggs divests the district court of control over only a narrow slice of the case. The interlocutory appeal addresses an order declining to compel arbitration. Griggs merely prevents the district court from modifying that order—i.e., Griggs prevents the district judge from revisiting whether to compel arbitration while the appeal is pending. Griggs does not stop the district court from proceeding on matters other than arbitrability.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,86,"The majority opinion, however, transmogrifies Griggs into a sweeping stay of pretrial and trial proceedings on not just arbitrability, but also the merits. Ante, at 1918. According to the majority, if the question on appeal is whether the litigation may go forward in the district court, then the district court loses control over the entire case. Ante, at 1919-1920 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,87,"That rule far surpasses the statement in Griggs—the sole statement on which the majority relies—that a district court loses control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. 459 U.S. at 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, ante, at 1919. Only the arbitrability order is on appeal, not the merits. And those matters are distinct. As this Court recognized (before Congress enacted § 16), arbitrability is easily severable from the merits of the underlying disputes. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 21, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,88,"The majority cannot justify why it treats these easily severable matters as intertwined in an arbitrability appeal. The question on appeal, as the majority opinion correctly identifies, is whether the case belongs in arbitration. Ante, at 1919. But the questions remaining before the district court are different: whether the claims have merit, whether the parties are entitled to the discovery they seek, and so on. Proceedings on those questions would not interfere with the appellate court's review of the arbitrability order. Those proceedings, in other words, do not implicate the Griggs principle, which addresses the danger a district court and a court of appeals would be simultaneously analyzing the same judgment. 459 U.S. at 59, 103 S.Ct. 400.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,89,"The Court today expands Griggs beyond what the Congress that enacted § 16 could have foreseen, let alone silently incorporated. Indeed, the majority can identify no other time this Court wielded Griggs to mandate a stay of all merits proceedings just because a distinct procedural question was on appeal.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,90,"In fact, the majority's supercharged version of Griggs contradicts its own account of Congress's intent. Consider the statutes that the majority points to as models of how Congress would reject a mandatory-general-stay rule. Ante, at 1921-1922, and n. 6, see supra, at 1925-1926. Under those statutes, the majority says, Congress intends that an interlocutory appeal does  not  automatically stay district court proceedings. Ante, at 1921. Yet, the majority also seemingly accepts that under those statutes, the Griggs principle applies. Ante, at 1920. And per the Griggs principle as the majority sees it, in some cases an interlocutory appeal does automatically stay district court proceedings. Ante, at 1919-1920. So a mandatory general stay is thus both prohibited (by the statutory text) and required (by the majority's view of Griggs).3 As this contradiction underscores, the majority's holding is untethered from any statute and any existing conception of Griggs.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,92,"To justify its new mandatory-general-stay rule, the majority ultimately rests on its assessment of what is sensible. Ante, at 1920-1921. But even the majority's policy concerns do not support its rule.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,93,"The dispute here turns on a subset of cases—those in which a stay is not warranted under the usual discretionary standard. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434, 129 S.Ct. 1749. All agree that an interlocutory appeal should trigger a stay if that standard is met. But the majority goes further and requires a stay in all cases. Indeed, the majority mandates a stay even if none of the traditional stay prerequisites are present: likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, favorable balance of equities, and alignment with the public interest. See ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,94,"The majority offers no good reason for that result. The majority says that an automatic stay protects the party seeking arbitration and conserves resources in case the dispute ultimately heads to arbitration after appeal. Ante, at 1921. But the concern fades if that scenario is unrealistic —i.e., if the party seeking arbitration is unlikely to succeed on appeal.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,95,"The majority's concern is even weaker when a stay would harm the opposing party and the public interest much more than it would protect the party seeking arbitration. Take, for example, a case in which crucial evidence would be lost if discovery is delayed. Say a witness is on her deathbed. Under the majority's rule, if an interlocutory arbitrability appeal under § 16(a) is pending, discovery must be stayed and the evidence must be lost. That is apparently so even if the parties agree they wish to proceed with discovery.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,96,"The majority's rule also prevents courts from crafting case-specific solutions to balance all the interests at stake. Under the traditional discretionary-stay rule, for instance, a judge could allow the parties to conduct only the forms of discovery that would also be permitted in arbitration. That would save time and leave nobody worse off even if, as the majority fears, the dispute ultimately heads to arbitration. But this kind of equitable resolution, which the court and the parties might consider sensible, ante, at 1921, is forbidden under  the majority's mandatory-general-stay rule.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,97,"In addition, for each of the majority's concerns favoring a mandatory stay, there are countervailing considerations. The majority professes interest in efficiency. Ibid. But forcing district court proceedings to a halt—for months or years while the appeal runs its course—is itself inefficient. The majority also fears losing other asserted benefits of arbitration without a stay. Ibid. But with a stay, the party opposing arbitration loses the benefits of immediate litigation. A plaintiff's request for injunctive protection against imminent harm, for example, goes unanswered under the majority's rule. Similarly, while the majority laments settlement pressure on parties seeking arbitration, ibid., the rule it announces imposes settlement pressure in the opposite direction. With justice delayed while the case is on hold, parties could be forced to settle, ibid., because they do not wish—or cannot afford—to leave their claims in limbo. Incongruously, the majority inflicts these burdens on the party that won the arbitrability issue before the district court (the party opposing arbitration).",Jackson,0,
2022-043,98,"In categorically resolving these conflicts in favor of the pro-arbitration party, the majority's analysis comes down to this: Because the pro-arbitration party gets an interlocutory appeal, it should also get an automatic stay. Ibid., see L. Numeroff, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie (1985). But Congress was entitled to give one without the other. And the right to interlocutory appeal is valuable on its own. It is, as the majority explains, a rare statutory exception to the usual rule that parties may not appeal before final judgment. Ante, at 1919. Even without a stay, if the interlocutory appeal succeeds, the pro-arbitration party gets its wish and the dispute goes to arbitration.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,99,"Perhaps for those reasons, real-life parties do not agree with the majority that an interlocutory arbitrability appeal is pointless without an automatic stay. No stay was issued in this case, for example, yet Coinbase still pursued its interlocutory appeal. Nor did other parties stop bringing interlocutory arbitrability appeals in the Circuits that had interpreted § 16 to impose no automatic stay.4",Jackson,0,
2022-043,100,"Yet this Court steps in to give the pro-arbitration party the additional right to an automatic stay that Congress withheld. Now, any defendant that devises a non-frivolous argument for arbitration can not only appeal, but also press pause on the case—leaving plaintiffs to suffer harm, lose evidence, and bleed dry their patience and funding in the meantime. To confer that power on a class of litigants, based on blanket judgments resolving competing policy concerns, is Congress's domain, not ours. And where Congress is silent, the job of managing particular litigation, in light of  the concrete circumstances presented, belongs to the judge closest to a case.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,102,"The Court today ventures down an uncharted path—and that way lies madness. Never before had this Court mandated a general stay simply because an interlocutory appeal poses the question whether the litigation may go forward in the district court. Ante, at 1920 (internal quotation marks omitted). And a wide array of appeals seemingly fits that bill.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,103,"Indeed, any appeal over the proper forum for a dispute would arguably raise the same question. After all, an arbitration agreement is `a specialized kind of forum-selection clause.' Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, 596 U.S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1906, 1919, 213 L.Ed.2d 179 (2022) (quoting Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 519, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974)). If arbitration appeals require stays of all pre-trial and trial proceedings, why not all appeals about forum-selection agreements? And why not appeals over non-contractual disputes over the proper adjudicator, like venue, personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens, federal-court jurisdiction, and abstention?",Jackson,0,
2022-043,104,"For that matter, virtually every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be described as conferring a `right not to stand trial.' Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 873, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). Such motions can be made in virtually every case. Ibid. Does every interlocutory appeal concerning a case-dispositive issue now trigger a mandatory general stay of trial court proceedings?",Jackson,0,
2022-043,105,"Taken that broadly, the mandatory-general-stay rule the Court adopts today would upend federal litigation as we know it. Aware that any interlocutory appeal on a dispositive issue grinds the plaintiff's case to a halt, defendants would presumably pursue that tactic at every opportunity. This would occur, for example, in interlocutory appeals available as of right under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) from orders granting preliminary injunctions. Any defense lawyer worth her salt would invoke the right to take that appeal and throw up some objection—to venue, jurisdiction, or a dispositive element of the merits—to trigger a mandatory stay. For plaintiffs, then, every preliminary-injunction motion becomes a trap: Even if the motion is granted, the defendant can take that opportunity to stop the trial court proceedings in their tracks.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,106,"Facing these destabilizing consequences, the majority stops short of following its own reasoning to that ominous conclusion. Today's holding reaches only arbitration appeals under § 16(a). Ante, at 1918, 1921-1922. And it might well be that the concerns motivating today's mandatory-general-stay rule do not extend beyond arbitration. So the majority will not commit, for example, to concluding that appeals over non-arbitration forum-selection clauses warrant the same mandatory stay. Ante, at 1922-1923.",Jackson,0,
2022-043,107,"I agree with that hesitation—even one step further down this path is much too far. The mandatory-general-stay rule that the Court manufactures is unmoored from Congress's commands and this Court's precedent. And the windfall that the Court gives to defendants seeking arbitration preferencing their interests over all others, is entirely unwarranted. The Court now mandates that result no matter how unjust that outcome is, according to traditional equitable standards, in a given case. This endeavor is unfounded, unwise, and—most fundamentally—not our role.",Jackson,0,

Applying the presumption against extraterritoriality, we hold that these provisions are not extraterritorial and that they extend only to claims where the claimed infringing use in commerce is domestic.",Alito,0,
2022-044,30,"This case concerns a trademark dispute between a United States company (Hetronic International, Inc.) and six foreign parties (five companies and one individual (collectively Abitron)).1 Hetronic manufactures radio remote controls for construction equipment. It sells and services these products, which employ a distinctive black-and-yellow color scheme to distinguish them from those of its competitors, in more than 45 countries. 10 F.4th 1016, 1024 (CA10 2021) (case below).",Alito,0,
2022-044,31,"Abitron originally operated as a licensed distributor for Hetronic, but it later concluded that it held the rights to much of Hetronic's intellectual property, including the marks on the products at issue in this suit. After reverse engineering Hetronic's products, Abitron began to sell Hetronic-branded products that incorporated parts sourced from third parties. Abitron mostly sold its products in Europe, but it also made some direct sales into the United States.",Alito,0,
2022-044,32,"Hetronic sued Abitron in the Western District of Oklahoma for, as relevant here, trademark violations under two related provisions of the Lanham Act. First, it invoked § 1114(1)(a), which prohibits the unauthorized use in commerce of any reproduction  of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services when such use is likely to cause confusion. Hetronic also invoked § 1125(a)(1), which prohibits the use in commerce of a protected mark, whether registered or not, that is likely to cause confusion. Hetronic sought damages under these provisions for Abitron's infringing acts worldwide.",Alito,0,
2022-044,33,"Throughout the proceedings below, Abitron argued that Hetronic sought an impermissible extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act. But the District Court rejected this argument, and a jury later awarded Hetronic approximately $96 million in damages related to Abitron's global employment of Hetronic's marks. This amount thus included damages from Abitron's direct sales to consumers in the United States, its foreign sales of products for which the foreign buyers designated the United States as the ultimate destination, and its foreign sales of products that did not end up in the United States. The District Court later entered a permanent injunction preventing Abitron from using the marks anywhere in the world. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit narrowed the injunction to cover only certain countries but otherwise affirmed the judgment. It concluded that the Lanham Act extended to all of Abitron's foreign infringing conduct because the impacts within the United States were of a sufficient character and magnitude as would give the United States a reasonably strong interest in the litigation. 10 F.4th at 1046.",Alito,0,

2022-044,37,"It is a `longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.' Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 255, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010). We have repeatedly explained that this principle, which we call the presumption against extraterritoriality, refers to a presumption against application to conduct in the territory of another sovereign. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 119, 133 S.Ct. 1659, 185 L.Ed.2d 671 (2013) (citing Morrison, 561 U.S. at 265, 130 S.Ct. 2869).

The presumption serves to avoid the international discord that can result when U. S. law is applied to conduct in foreign countries and reflects the `commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.' RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 579 U.S. 325, 335-336, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 195 L.Ed.2d 476 (2016).",Alito,0,
2022-044,38,"Applying the presumption against extraterritoriality involves a two-step framework. Id., at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090. At step one, we determine whether a provision is extraterritorial, and that determination turns on whether Congress has affirmatively and unmistakably instructed that the provision at issue should apply to foreign conduct. Id., at 335, 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090, accord, Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 117, 133 S.Ct. 1659 (asking whether Congress intends federal law to apply to conduct occurring abroad), Nestlé USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U. S. ___, ___ 141 S.Ct. 1931, 1935-1936, 210 L.Ed.2d 207 (2021).

2022-044,39,"If a provision is not extraterritorial, we move to step two, which resolves whether the suit seeks a (permissible) domestic or (impermissible) foreign application of the provision.2 To make that determination, courts must start by identifying the `focus of congressional concern' underlying the provision at issue. Id., at 336, 136 S.Ct. 2090. The focus of a statute is `the object of its solicitude,' which can include the conduct it `seeks to regulate,' as well as the parties and interests it `seeks to protect' or vindicate.

2022-044,40,"Step two does not end with identifying statutory focus. We have repeatedly and explicitly held that courts must identify `the statute's focus' and ask whether the conduct relevant to that focus occurred in United States territory. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2136 (emphasis added), accord, e.g., RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090. Thus, to prove that a claim involves a domestic application of a statute, plaintiffs must establish that `the conduct relevant to the statute's focus occurred in the United States.' Nestlé, 593  U.

2022-044,41,"Step two is designed to apply the presumption against extraterritoriality to claims that involve both domestic and foreign activity, separating the activity that matters from the activity that does not. After all, we have long recognized that the presumption would be meaningless if any domestic conduct could defeat it. See Morrison, 561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869. Thus, `if the conduct relevant to the statute's focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application' of the statute, `even if other conduct occurred abroad.' WesternGeco, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137 (quoting RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090). And if the relevant conduct occurred in another country, `then the case involves an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other conduct that occurred in U. S. territory.'

Of course, if all the conduct `regarding the violations `took place outside the United States,' then courts do not need to determine the statute's `focus' at all. RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090. In that circumstance, there would be no domestic conduct that could be relevant to any focus, so the focus test has no filtering role to play. See, e.g., Nestlé, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1937, Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 124, 133 S.Ct. 1659.",Alito,0,

2022-044,44,"It is a rare statute that clearly evidences extraterritorial effect despite lacking an express statement of extraterritoriality. Id., at 340, 136 S.Ct. 2090. Our decision in RJR Nabisco illustrates the clarity required at step one of our framework. There, we held that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act could have extraterritorial application in some circumstances because many of its predicate offenses plainly apply to at least some foreign conduct and at least one predicate  applies only to conduct occurring outside the United States. Id., at 338, 136 S.Ct. 2090.",Alito,0,
2022-044,45,"Here, neither provision at issue provides an express statement of extraterritorial application or any other clear indication that it is one of the rare provisions that nonetheless applies abroad.

2022-044,46,"Hetronic acknowledges that neither provision on its own signals extraterritorial application, but it argues that the requisite indication can be found in the Lanham Act's definition of commerce, which applies to both provisions. Under that definition, `commerce' means all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress. § 1127. Hetronic offers two reasons why this definition is sufficient to rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. First, it argues that the language naturally leads to this result because Congress can lawfully regulate foreign conduct under the Foreign Commerce Clause. Second, it contends that extraterritoriality is confirmed by the fact that this definition is unique in the U. S. Code and thus differs from what it describes as boilerplate definitions of `commerce' in other statutes. Brief for Respondent 23.",Alito,0,
2022-044,47,"Neither reason is sufficient. When applying the presumption, `we have repeatedly held that even statutes  that expressly refer to foreign commerce' when defining commerce are not extraterritorial. Morrison, 561 U.S. at 262-263, 130 S.Ct. 2869, see also RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 344, 136 S.Ct. 2090. This conclusion dooms Hetronic's argument. If an express statutory reference to foreign commerce is not enough to rebut the presumption, the same must be true of a definition of commerce that refers to Congress's authority to regulate foreign commerce. That result does not change simply because the provision refers to all commerce Congress can regulate. See Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 118, 133 S.Ct. 1659. (It is well established that generic terms like `any' or `every' do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality). And the mere fact that the Lanham Act contains a substantively similar definition that departs from the so-called boilerplate definitions used in other statutes cannot justify a different conclusion either.",Alito,0,
2022-044,49,"Because § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1) are not extraterritorial, we must consider when claims involve domestic applications of these provisions. As discussed above, the proper test requires determining the provision's focus and then ascertaining whether Hetronic can establish that the conduct relevant to that focus occurred in the United States.'

2022-044,50,"Much of the parties' dispute in this case misses this critical point and centers on the focus of the relevant provisions without regard to the conduct relevant to that focus. WesternGeco, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2136. Abitron contends that § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1) focus on preventing infringing use of trademarks, while Hetronic argues that they focus both on protecting the goodwill of mark owners and on preventing consumer confusion. The United States as a micus curiae argues that the provisions focus on only likely consumer confusion.",Alito,0,
2022-044,51,"The parties all seek support for their positions in Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 73 S.Ct. 252, 97 L.Ed. 319 (1952), but that decision is of little assistance here. There, we considered a suit alleging that the defendant, through activity in both the United States and Mexico, had violated the Lanham Act by producing and selling watches stamped with a trademark that was protected in the United States. Although we allowed the claim to proceed, our analysis understandably did not follow the two-step framework that we would develop decades later. Our decision was instead narrow and factbound. It rested on the judgment that the facts in the record  when viewed as a whole were  sufficient to rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. Id., at 285, 73 S.Ct. 252. In reaching this conclusion, we repeatedly emphasized both that the defendant committed essential steps in the course of his infringing conduct in the United States and that his conduct was likely to and did cause consumer confusion in the United States.4 Id., at 286-287, 73 S.Ct. 252, accord, e.g., id., at 286, 73 S.Ct. 252 (His operations and their effects were not confined within the territorial limits of a foreign nation), id., at 288, 73 S.Ct. 252 (Petitioner by his `own deliberate acts, here and elsewhere, brought about forbidden results within the United States' (alteration omitted)). Because Steele implicated both domestic conduct and a likelihood of domestic confusion, it does not tell us which one determines the domestic applications of § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1).",Alito,0,
2022-044,52,"With Steele put aside, then, we think the parties' particular debate over the focus of § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1) in the abstract does not exhaust the relevant inquiry. The ultimate question regarding permissible domestic application turns on the location of the conduct relevant to the focus. See, e.g., RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090. And the conduct relevant to any focus the parties have proffered is infringing use in commerce, as the Act defines it.",Alito,0,
2022-044,53,"This conclusion follows from the text and context of § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1). Both provisions prohibit the unauthorized use in commerce of a protected trademark when, among other things, that use is likely to cause confusion. §§ 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1). In other words, Congress proscribed the use of a mark in commerce under certain conditions. This conduct, to be sure, must create a sufficient risk of confusion, but confusion is not a separate requirement, rather, it is simply a necessary characteristic of an offending use.5 Because Congress has premised liability does on a specific action (a particular sort of use in commerce), that specific action would be the conduct relevant to any focus on offer today. See, e.g., WesternGeco, 585 U. S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137-2138.",Alito,0,
2022-044,54,"In sum, as this case comes to us, use in commerce is the conduct relevant to any potential focus of § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1) because Congress deemed a violation of either provision to occur each time a mark is used in commerce in the way Congress described, with no need for any actual confusion. Under step two of our extraterritoriality standard, then, use  in commerce provides the dividing line between foreign and domestic applications of these Lanham Act provisions.",Alito,0,
2022-044,56,"Resisting this straightforward application of our precedent, Justice SOTOMAYOR concludes that step two of our extraterritoriality framework turns solely on whether the object of the statute's focus is found in, or occurs in, the United States. Post, at 2539 (opinion concurring in judgment). Applied to the Lanham Act, the upshot of this focus-only standard is that any claim involving a likelihood of consumer confusion in the United States would be a domestic application of the Act. This approach is wrong, and it would give the Lanham Act an untenably broad reach that undermines our extraterritoriality framework.",Alito,0,
2022-044,58,"To justify looking only to a provision's focus, Justice SOTOMAYOR maintains that an application of a statute can still be domestic when foreign conduct is implicated. Post, at 2540. If this assertion simply means that a permissible domestic application can occur even when some foreign activity is involved in the case, Morrison, 561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869, then it is true but misses the point. When a claim involves both domestic and foreign activity, the question is whether `the conduct relevant to the statute's focus occurred in the United States.' Nestlé, 593 U. S., at ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1936. If that `conduct  occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application' of the statute `even if other conduct occurred abroad.' WesternGeco, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137. But if the conduct relevant to the focus occurred in a foreign country, then the case involves an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other conduct that occurred in U. S. territory. RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090, see, e.g., WesternGeco, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137-2138, Nestlé, 593 U.

2022-044,59,"These holdings were not, as Justice SOTOMAYOR suggests, premised on this Court's first concluding (or assuming without deciding) that the focus of the provision at issue was conduct. Post, at 2541. They were unambiguously part of this Court's articulation of the two-step framework, and, in each case, these holdings came before we began analyzing the focus of the provisions at issue. For this reason, none of our cases has ever held that statutory focus was dispositive at step two of our framework. To the contrary, we have acknowledged that courts do not need to determine a statute's `focus' when all conduct regarding the violations `took place outside the United States.' RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090 (quoting Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 124, 133 S.Ct. 1659), see, e.g., Nestlé, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1937 (To plead facts sufficient to support a domestic application of the Alien Tort Statute, plaintiffs must allege more domestic conduct than general corporate activity). That conclusion, as well as the decisions applying it, are inexplicable under a focus-only standard. See supra, at 2529.",Alito,0,
2022-044,60,"Beyond straying from established precedent, a focus-only approach would create headaches for lower courts required to grapple with this new approach. For statutes (like this one) regulating conduct, the location of the conduct relevant to the focus provides a clear signal at both steps of our two-step framework. See RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 335, 337, 136 S.Ct. 2090. Under Justice SOTOMAYOR's standard,  by contrast, litigants and lower courts are told that the step-two inquiry turns on the `focus' alone, which (as we have said) can be `conduct,' `parties,' or `interests' that Congress sought to protect or regulate. Post, at 2541, see WesternGeco, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137. As a result, almost any claim involving exclusively foreign conduct could be repackaged as a domestic application. And almost any claim under a non-extraterritorial provision could be defeated by labeling it a foreign application, even if the conduct at issue was exclusively domestic. This is far from the measure of certainty that the presumption against extraterritoriality is designed to provide.",Alito,0,
2022-044,62,"Justice SOTOMAYOR's expansive understanding of the Lanham Act's domestic applications threatens to negate the presumption against extraterritoriality. In Morrison, we warned that the presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case. 561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869. If a claim under the Act involves a domestic application whenever particular `effects are likely to occur in the United States,' post, at 2539, the watchdog is nothing more than a muzzled Chihuahua. Under such a test, it would not even be necessary that some domestic activity be involved. It would be enough for there to be merely a likelihood of an effect in this country. Applying that standard here would require even less connection to the United States than some explicitly extraterritorial statutes, which must have, at a minimum, actual domestic effects to be invoked. See, e.g., Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 796, 113 S.Ct. 2891, 125 L.Ed.2d 612 (1993) (holding that the extraterritorial provision at issue applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States).",Alito,0,
2022-044,63,"This approach threatens `international discord.' Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 115, 133 S.Ct. 1659. In nearly all countries, including the United States, trademark law is territorial—i.e., a trademark is recognized as having a separate existence in each sovereign territory in which it is registered or legally recognized as a mark. 5 McCarthy § 29:1, at 29-4 to 29-5. Thus, each country is empowered to grant trademark rights and police infringement within its borders. See, e.g., ibid., Ingenohl v. Olsen & Co., 273 U.S. 541, 544, 47 S.Ct. 451, 71 L.Ed. 762 (1927), A. Bourjois & Co. v. Katzel, 260 U.S. 689, 692, 43 S.Ct. 244, 67 L.Ed. 464 (1923).",Alito,0,
2022-044,64,"This principle has long been enshrined in international law. Under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, July 14, 1967, 21 U. S. T. 1583, T. I. A. S. No. 6923, a mark duly registered in a country of the Union shall be regarded as independent of marks registered in other countries of the Union, and the seizure of infringing goods is authorized on importation to a country where such mark or trade name is entitled to legal protection. Arts. 6(3), 9(1), id., at 1639, 1647. The Convention likewise provides mechanisms for trademark holders to secure trademark protection in other countries under the domestic law of those countries.

No. 03-112, S. Treaty Doc. No. 106-41 (entered into force Dec. 1, 1995) (providing mechanisms for the extension of trademark protection to multiple jurisdictions under domestic law). The Lanham Act, which is designed to implement treaties  and conventions respecting trademarks, § 1127, incorporates this territorial premise, mandating that registration of a foreign trademark in the United States shall be independent of the registration in the country of origin and that the rights of that mark in the United States are governed by domestic law, § 1126(f).",Alito,0,
2022-044,65,"Because of the territorial nature of trademarks, the probability of incompatibility with the applicable laws of other counties is so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign application `it would have addressed the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.' Morrison, 561 U.S. at 269, 130 S.Ct. 2869. The use of a mark—even confined to one country —will often have effects that radiate to any number of countries. And when determining exactly what form of abstract consumer confusion is sufficient in a given case, the Judiciary would be thrust into the unappetizing task of navigating foreign policy disputes belonging to the political branches. Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1386, 1412, 200 L.Ed.2d 612 (2018) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

To police allegations of infringement occurring in Germany, it continues, would be an unseemly act of meddling in extraterritorial affairs, given international treaty obligations that equally bind the United States.

I write separately to address those points.",Jackson,0,
2022-044,72,"It is clear beyond cavil that what makes a trademark a trademark under the Lanham Act is its source-identifying function. See Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC, 599 U.

That is, under the Act, a trademark is any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, that a person uses or intends to use to identify and distinguish his or her goods  from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods. § 1127, see also Qualitex Co., 514 U.S. at 162-163, 115 S.Ct. 1300 (emphasizing centrality of this source-identifying function). Sections 1114(1)(a) and 1125(a)(1) permit a mark owner to sue someone who is using that mark in commerce in a way `likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.' B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 144, 135 S.Ct. 1293, 191 L.Ed.2d 222 (2015).",Jackson,0,
2022-044,73,"Critically, the Act defines `use in commerce' as the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade. § 1127. And, in light of the core source-identifying function of marks, Congress's statutory scheme embodies a distinction between trademark uses (use of a symbol or equivalent `to identify or brand a defendant's goods or services') and `non-trademark uses' (use of a symbol—even the same one—in a `non-source-identifying way'). Jack Daniel's, 599 U. S., at ___, 143 S.Ct., at 1589-1590. This all points to something key about what it means to use a trademark in the sense Congress prohibited—i.e., in a way likely to commit the cardinal sin of confusing consumers about source. Id., at ___, 143 S.Ct., at 1589.",Jackson,0,
2022-044,74,"Simply put, a use in commerce does not cease at the place the mark is first affixed, or where the item to which it is affixed is first sold. Rather, it can occur wherever the mark serves its source-identifying function. So, even after a trademark begins to be used in commerce (say, when goods on which it is placed are sold), that trademark is also used in commerce wherever and whenever those goods are in commerce, because as long as they are, the trademark identifies and distinguishes  the source of the goods. § 1127. Such a use is not free-floating, the trademark is being used by the person who put that trademark on the goods to identify and distinguish them in commerce and indicate their source. Ibid. This is the use in commerce to which § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1) refer.",Jackson,0,

Next, imagine that American students buy the bags while on spring break overseas, and upon their return home employ those bags to carry personal items. Imagine finally that a representative of Coach (the United States company) sees the students with the bags and persuades Coach to sue the German company for Lanham Act infringement, fearing that the Coache mark will cause consumer confusion. Absent additional facts, such a claim seeks an impermissibly extraterritorial application of the Act.

Now, the marked bags are in domestic commerce, the marks that the German company affixed to them overseas continue to identify and distinguish the goods from others in the (now domestic) marketplace and to indicate the source of the goods. Ibid. So the German company continues to use the mark in commerce within the meaning of the Act, thus triggering potential liability under § 1114(1)(a) and § 1125(a)(1).

The Court has repeatedly held that even statutes that contain broad language in their definitions of `commerce' that expressly refer to `foreign commerce' do not apply abroad to all foreign conduct. Morrison, 561 U.S. at 262-263., 130 S.Ct. 2869 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 344, 136 S.Ct. 2090 (a statute's reference to foreign commerce does not mean literally all commerce occurring abroad). The Court has also explained that generic  terms like `any' or `every' do not rebut the presumption. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 118, 133 S.Ct. 1659, 185 L.Ed.2d 671 (2013). The term all is not meaningfully different. While the word conveys breadth, Peter v. NantKwest, Inc., 589 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 365, 372, 205 L.Ed.2d 304 (2019), it does not rebut the presumption either.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,95,"The Court's inquiry at step two centers on the focus of the statutory provisions. Like the Court's analysis at step one, this inquiry is contextual, the Court does not analyze the provision at issue in a vacuum. WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp., 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 2129, 2137, 201 L.Ed.2d 584 (2018). Rather, the Court looks at the provision in concert with other relevant provisions and considers how the statute has actually been applied. Ibid. The aim of determining the statutory focus is to assess what constitutes a domestic application of the statute. An application is domestic when the object of the statute's focus is found in, or occurs in, the United States. See, e.g., Morrison, 561 U.S. at 266-267, 273, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (where the focus of the Exchange Act is purchases and sales of securities, there is no domestic application of the statute when those purchases and securities occurred outside the United States, regardless of the place where the deception originated).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,96,"The parties offer different interpretations of the focus of §§ 32(1)(a) and 43(a)(1)(A). Petitioners argue that the focus of the statute is the use of the mark in commerce. Brief for Petitioners 39. Under petitioners' theory, the Lanham Act does not reach any infringing products sold abroad, instead, the defendant must sell the products directly into the United States. Id., at 44-45. Respondent, by contrast, argues that the Act has two distinct focuses: protecting mark owners from reputational harm and protecting consumers from confusion. Brief for Respondent 45-48. Under respondent's view, reputational harm to the mark owner is not necessarily tied to the locus of consumer confusion or the locus of the defendant's conduct. Id., at 47. Instead, respondent asserts, harm to a mark owner's reputation is felt where the mark owner resides. Ibid. The Government, as amicus curiae supporting neither party, offers a middle ground. In its view, the focus of the statute is consumer confusion. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14 (United States Brief). Accordingly, where such effects are likely to occur in the United States, application of Sections 32(1)(a) and 43(a)(1)(A) is a permissible domestic application of the Act, even if the defendant's own conduct occurred elsewhere. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,97,"I agree with the Government's position. Sections 32(1)(a) and 43(a)(1)(A) of the Act prohibit specific types of uses in commerce: uses that are likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1)(A). The statute thus makes clear that prohibiting the use in commerce is merely the means by which the statute achieves its end of protecting consumers from confusion. WesternGeco LLC, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2138. Stated differently, a competitor's use does not infringe a mark unless it is likely to confuse consumers. Patent and Trademark Office v. Booking.com B.V., 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2298, 2307, 207 L.Ed.2d 738 (2020), see 4 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 23:1, p. 23-9 (5th ed. 2023) (McCarthy) (Likelihood of confusion is the keystone of trademark infringement). Because the statute's focus is protection against consumer confusion, the statute covers foreign infringement activities if there is a likelihood of consumer  confusion in the United States and all other conditions for liability are established. See infra, at 2543.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,98,"Treating consumer confusion as the focus of the Act is consistent with Steele, which focused on the domestic effects of the defendant's foreign conduct. 344 U.S. at 286, 73 S.Ct. 252. Steele emphasized that, although the defendant did not affix the mark or sell the products in the United States, spurious `Bulovas' filtered through the Mexican border into this country, causing consumer confusion here. Id., at 285-287, 73 S.Ct. 252. These domestic effects, the Court reasoned, could reflect adversely on Bulova Watch Company's trade reputation in the United States. Id., at 286, 73 S.Ct. 252. In other words, consistent with the statutory text, Steele focused on the impact of the defendant's foreign conduct on the consumer market in the United States (in accord with the Government's view here), not the location of the original sale of the infringing product or the location of the trademark owner's business (contrary to petitioners' and respondent's views here).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,99,"The Court's precedent also supports the view that an application of a statute can be considered domestic even when foreign conduct is implicated. In Morrison, for example, the Court concluded that § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, does not punish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct `in connection with the purchase or sale of' securities in the United States. 561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)). Thus, the focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where the deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of securities in the United States. 561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869. Those purchase-and-sale transactions are the objects of the statute's solicitude. Id., at 267, S.Ct. 2869. Under Morrison, a domestic application of § 10(b) covers misrepresentations made abroad, so long as the deceptive conduct bears the requisite connection to the statute's focus: the domestic purchase or sale of a security. Similarly, under §§ 32(1)(a) and 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act, uses of a mark in commerce are actionable when they cause a likelihood of consumer confusion in the United States, even when the conduct originates abroad.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,101,"The Court agrees with petitioners' bottom line that the Lanham Act requires a domestic use in commerce. See ante, at 2530-2532. According to the majority, the `use in commerce' provides the dividing line between foreign and domestic applications of these Lanham Act provisions. Ante, at 2531-2532. Yet the majority does not actually take a stance on the focus of the Act or apply this Court's settled law. Instead, to reach its conclusion, the majority transforms the Court's extraterritoriality framework into a myopic conduct-only test.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,102,"Specifically, instead of discerning the statute's focus and assessing whether that focus is found domestically, as the Court's precedents command, the majority now requires a third step: an assessment of whether the conduct relevant to the focus occurred domestically, even when the focus of the statute is not conduct. Ante, at 2531. Making matters even more confusing, the majority skips over the middle step of this new framework, concluding that it is unnecessary to discern the focus of the Lanham Act because the conduct relevant to any potential focus that the parties have proffered must be use in commerce, since that is conduct mentioned in the statute. Ibid.3 In other words,  under the Court's unprecedented three-step framework, no statute can reach relevant conduct abroad, no matter the true object of the statute's solicitude.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,103,"The Court's novel approach transforms the traditional inquiry at step two into a conduct-only test, in direct conflict with this Court's jurisprudence. The Court has expressly recognized that a statute's focus can be conduct, parties, or interests that Congress sought to protect or regulate. WesternGeco LLC, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2138 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Morrison, 561 U.S. at 266, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (the focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where the deception originated). After all, not every federal statute subject to an extraterritoriality analysis directly regulates conduct. Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 116, 133 S.Ct. 1659.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,104,"Because precedent does not support the Court's recitation of the extraterritoriality framework, the majority retreats to a distorted reading of the Court's past decisions. The majority relies on RJR Nabisco, see ante, at 2531, but that case does not support the majority's course. The Court in RJR Nabisco noted that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act's civil suit provision requires an injury to business or property. 579 U.S. at 354, 136 S.Ct. 2090. The Court then concluded that there is a domestic application of that provision so long as there is a domestic injury. Ibid. In other words, the Court held that the focus of the statute had to occur domestically. It did not require a third step.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,105,"The Court also repeatedly quotes from cases where the Court has said that a domestic application requires that the conduct relevant to the statute's focus occurred in the United States. Ante, 2528 2529, 2531-2532. In those cases, however, the Court first concluded (or assumed without deciding) that the focus of the provision at issue was conduct, and only then proceeded to consider whether the relevant conduct occurred domestically. In WesternGeco, for example, the Court considered the extraterritorial application of § 271(f)(2) of the Patent Act, which formed the basis for the plaintiff's infringement claim. 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137. The focus of that provision, the Court concluded, is the act of `supplying in or from the United States,' so the conduct relevant to that focus was the defendant's domestic act of supplying the components that infringed the plaintiff's patents. Id., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137-2138, see also Nestlé USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U. S. ___, ___-___, 141 S.Ct. 1931, 1936-1937, 210 L.Ed.2d 207 (2021) (assuming without deciding that the `focus' of the statute is conduct that violates international law and then concluding that conduct relevant to that focus occurred in Ivory Coast). In other words, the Court looked to whether the focus of the statute at issue occurred domestically.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,106,"In sum, none of the cases upon which the majority relies establish categorically that there must be domestic conduct in order for there to be a domestic application of a statute. Calling this requirement straightforward, established precedent does not make it so. Ante, at 2531-2533.4  The Court's transformative approach thwarts Congress' ability to regulate important interests or parties that Congress has the power to regulate. WesternGeco LLC, 585 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 2137. Some statutes may have a statutory focus that is not strictly conduct and that implicates some conduct abroad. Cf., e.g., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U.S. 155, 165, 124 S.Ct. 2359, 159 L.Ed.2d 226 (2004) (recognizing the long-established view that U. S. antitrust laws reflect a legislative effort to redress domestic antitrust injury that foreign anticompetitive conduct has caused (emphasis deleted)). Under the Court's new categorical rule, those statutes may not cover relevant conduct occurring abroad, even if that conduct impacts domestic interests that Congress sought to protect. At bottom, by reframing the inquiry at step two as a conduct-only test, the Court's new rule frustrates a key function of the presumption against extraterritoriality: to discern congressional meaning and preserve a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects to protect domestic interests, Morrison, 561 U.S. at 261, 130 S.Ct. 2869, including those of U. S. trademark owners and consumers.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,107,"The Court's analysis is also inconsistent with Steele. According to the Court, Steele implicated both domestic conduct and a likelihood of domestic confusion, so it offers no guidance in resolving this case. Ante, at 2531. No court of appeals has read Steele that way, and for good reason: Steele clearly recognized that infringing acts consummated abroad fall under the purview of the Lanham Act when they generate consumer confusion in the United States. See supra, at 2537-2538, 2539 2540.5 Finding Steele of little assistance to its blinkered approach, the majority reduces Steele to a narrow case with no application beyond its facts. Ante, at 2530-2531. Steele is no such thing. It addressed the weighty question whether the Lanham Act extends beyond the boundaries of the United States, 344 U.S. at 285, 73 S.Ct. 252, and has guided the lower courts' extraterritoriality analysis for more than 70 years. The Court should not put aside the Court's precedent merely because it is convenient to do so. Ante, at 2531.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,108,"Because the Court cannot ground its holding in precedent, it turns to abstract policy considerations. According to the majority, the focus of the Lanham Act cannot center on consumer confusion, despite Steele and the statute's clear textual clues,  because any focus other than conduct is too uncertain and would create headaches for lower courts. Ante, at 2532. The Court's conclusion, however, is based on the incorrect assumption that merely a likelihood of an effect in this country would be sufficient to hold a defendant liable under the Act. Ante, at 2533 (emphasis deleted). What the Lanham Act requires is a likelihood of confusion in the United States, not some abstract and undefined effect. The likelihood-of-confusion test comes straight from the statute's text. As petitioners and the Court acknowledge, it is at the very core of the inquiry under §§ 32(1)(a) and 43(a)(1)(A). See Brief for Petitioners 47-48, ante, at 2531. Assessing likelihood of confusion may require a nuanced test, but it is the test that Congress chose and that courts already apply.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,109,"In addition, any plaintiff would need to do more than point to mere likelihood of confusion, as with any cause of action, the plaintiff must establish all necessary elements for recovery. For example, although use in commerce is not the statute's focus, the statute still requires that the plaintiff establish a use in commerce. §§ 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1)(A). As Steele shows, because commerce includes all commerce that Congress has the power to regulate, § 1127, some foreign sales can fall under the statute's reach. See also RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 344, 136 S.Ct. 2090 (the term `foreign commerce' does not mean literally all commerce occurring abroad, but it includes commerce directly involving the United States, including commerce between the United States and a foreign country).6 Plaintiffs must also generally show, for example, that their injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute. Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014). The Court is thus mistaken that abstract consumer confusion is sufficient to recover under the Lanham Act. Ante, at 2534.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,110,"The Court also incorrectly concludes that a test that focuses on domestic consumer confusion conflicts with the territoriality principle of trademark law. See ante, at 2533-2534. That principle recognizes that a trademark has separate legal existence in each country where the mark is registered or legally recognized. 5 McCarthy § 29:1, at 29-5, see Ingenohl v. Olsen & Co., 273 U.S. 541, 544, 47 S.Ct. 451, 71 L.Ed. 762 (1927) (noting that a trademark secured in one country depends for its protection there and confers no rights elsewhere). Thus, to obtain the benefits that flow from trademark rights, such as the right to a non-confused public, the plaintiff must secure those rights in the country where it wants protection. 1 McCarthy § 2:10, at 2-24.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,111,"A focus on consumer confusion in the United States is consistent with that international system. That focus properly cabins the Act's reach to foreign conduct that results in infringing products causing consumer confusion domestically while leaving to foreign jurisdictions the authority to remedy confusion within their territories. United States Brief 25-26, see Brief for European Commission on Behalf of the European Union as Amicus Curiae 6 (The test for infringement in the European  Union, including in Germany, like the United States, assesses whether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion). In other words, applying the Lanham Act to domestic consumer confusion promotes the benefits of U. S. trademark rights in the territory of the United States.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,112,"The Court's approach, by contrast, would absolve from liability those defendants who sell infringing products abroad that reach the United States and confuse consumers here. That resulting consumer confusion in the United States, however, falls squarely within the scope of the interests that the Lanham Act seeks to protect.7",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,113,"The Court's arguments about the impending international discord that will result from the Government's approach are simply overblown. Ante, at 2533 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is no evidence that Steele, which is consistent with a focus on domestic consumer confusion, has created any international tension since it was decided more than 70 years ago. Moreover, as even petitioners acknowledge, purely foreign sales with no connection to the United States are unlikely to confuse consumers domestically. See Brief for Petitioners 44. Foreign companies with purely foreign operations also have at their disposal important defenses grounded in due process and international comity principles, including the ability to dismiss a case in the United States for lack of personal jurisdiction or on the ground of forum non conveniens. See, e.g., Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 257-261, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981).8",Sotomayor,0,
2022-044,114,"Finally, the Court relies upon the amicus brief filed by the European Commission in support of its concern about the risk of international tension that the Government's position supposedly creates. Ante, at 2534. The European Commission filed its brief in support of neither party, however, in line with the Solicitor General's view that a focus on consumer confusion provides a more balanced approach that respects international relations while protecting against trademark infringement domestically. No sovereign nation filed its brief in support of petitioners' (and the  Court's) restricted view of step two of the extraterritoriality analysis. Ibid. And there is no tension in any event, What the European Commission warns this Court against, ibid., is adopting respondent's sweeping view that all foreign uses that confuse consumers abroad fall under the scope of the Act.

2022-044,115,"The Lanham Act covers petitioners' activities abroad so long as respondent can show that those activities are likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive in the United States and can prove all elements necessary to establish liability under the Act. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1)(A). Because the courts below did not apply that test, I agree vacatur and remand is required. The Court's opinion, however, instructs the Court on remand to apply a test that is not supported by either the Lanham Act or this Court's traditional two-step extraterritoriality framework. I therefore concur only in the judgment.9",Sotomayor,0,
2022-045,30,"This case is about dog toys and whiskey, two items seldom appearing in the same sentence. Respondent VIP Products makes a squeaky, chewable dog toy designed to look like a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. Though not entirely. On the toy, for example, the words Jack Daniel's become Bad Spaniels. And the descriptive phrase Old No. 7 Brand Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey turns into The Old No. 2 On Your Tennessee Carpet. The jokes did not impress petitioner Jack Daniel's Properties. It owns trademarks in the distinctive Jack Daniel's bottle and in many of the words and graphics on the label. And it believed Bad Spaniels had both infringed and diluted those trademarks. Bad Spaniels had infringed the marks, the argument ran, by leading consumers to think that Jack Daniel's had created, or was otherwise responsible for, the dog toy. And Bad Spaniels had diluted the marks, the argument went on, by associating the famed whiskey with, well, dog excrement.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,31,"The Court of Appeals, in the decision we review, saw things differently. Though the federal trademark statute makes infringement turn on the likelihood of consumer confusion, the Court of Appeals never got to that issue. On the court's view, the First Amendment compels a stringent threshold test when an infringement suit challenges a so-called expressive work—here (so said the court), the Bad Spaniels toy. And that test knocked out Jack Daniel's claim, whatever the likelihood of confusion. Likewise, Jack's dilution claim failed—though on that issue the problem was statutory. The trademark law provides that the noncommercial use of a mark cannot count as dilution. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(C). The Bad Spaniels marks, the court held, fell within that exemption because the toy  communicated a message—a kind of parody —about Jack Daniel's.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,32,"Today, we reject both conclusions. The infringement issue is the more substantial. In addressing it, we do not decide whether the threshold inquiry applied in the Court of Appeals is ever warranted. We hold only that it is not appropriate when the accused infringer has used a trademark to designate the source of its own goods—in other words, has used a trademark as a trademark. That kind of use falls within the heartland of trademark law, and does not receive special First Amendment protection. The dilution issue is more simply addressed. The use of a mark does not count as noncommercial just because it parodies, or otherwise comments on, another's products.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,35,"Start at square 1, with what a trademark is and does. The Lanham Act, the core federal trademark statute, defines a trademark as follows: Any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof that a person uses to identify and distinguish his or her goods  from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods. § 1127. The first part of that definition, identifying the kind of things covered, is broad: It encompasses words (think Google), graphic designs (Nike's swoosh), and so-called trade dress, the overall appearance of a product and its packaging (a Hershey's Kiss, in its silver wrapper). See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U.S. 205, 209-210, 120 S.Ct. 1339, 146 L.Ed.2d 182 (2000). The second part of the definition describes every trademark's primary function: to identify the origin or ownership of the article to which it is affixed. Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 412, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713 (1916). Trademarks can of course do other things: catch a consumer's eye, appeal to his fancies, and convey every manner of message. But whatever else it may do, a trademark is not a trademark unless it identifies a product's source (this is a Nike) and distinguishes that source from others (not any other sneaker brand). See generally 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 3:1 (5th ed. 2023). In other words, a mark tells the public who is responsible for a product.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,36,"In serving that function, trademarks benefit consumers and producers alike. A source-identifying mark enables customers to select the goods and services that they wish to purchase, as well as those they want to avoid. Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 224, 137 S.Ct. 1744, 198 L.Ed.2d 366 (2017). The mark quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item— the item with this mark—is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 164, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 131 L.Ed.2d 248 (1995). And because that is so, the producer of a quality product may derive significant value from its marks. They ensure that the producer itself —and not some imitating competitor —will reap the financial rewards associated with the product's good reputation. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,37,"To help protect marks, the Lanham Act sets up a voluntary registration system. Any mark owner may apply to the Patent and Trademark Office to get its mark placed on a federal register. Consistent with trademark law's basic purpose, the lead criterion for registration is that the mark in fact serve as a `trademark' to identify and distinguish goods. 3 McCarthy § 19:10 (listing the principal register's eligibility standards). If it does, and the  statute's other criteria also are met, the registering trademark owner receives certain benefits, useful in infringement litigation. See, e.g., Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2294, 2297, 204 L.Ed.2d 714 (2019) (noting that registration constitutes `prima facie evidence' of the mark's validity). But the owner of even an unregistered trademark can use the mark in commerce and enforce it against infringers. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,38,"The Lanham Act also creates a federal cause of action for trademark infringement. In the typical case, the owner of a mark sues someone using a mark that closely resembles its own. The court must decide whether the defendant's use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. §§ 1114(1)(A), 1125(a)(1)(A). The keystone in that statutory standard is likelihood of confusion. See 4 McCarthy § 23:1. And the single type of confusion most commonly in trademark law's sights is confusion about the source of a product or service. Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418, 428, 123 S.Ct. 1115, 155 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003), see 4 McCarthy § 23:5. Confusion as to source is the bête noire of trademark law—the thing that stands directly opposed to the law's twin goals of facilitating consumers' choice and protecting producers' good will.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,39,"Finally, the Lanham Act creates a cause of action for the dilution of famous marks, which can succeed without likelihood of confusion. See § 1125(c), Moseley, 537 U.S., at 431, 123 S.Ct. 1115. A famous mark is one widely recognized by the public as designating the source of the mark owner's goods. § 1125(c)(2)(A). Dilution of such a mark can occur by tarnishment (as well as by blurring, not relevant here). § 1125(c)(1). As the statute describes the idea, an association arising from the similarity between two marks— one of them famous—may harm the reputation of the famous mark, and thus make the other mark's owner liable. § 1125(c)(2)(C). But there are exclusions —categories of activity not actionable as dilution. § 1125(c)(3). One exclusion protects any noncommercial use of a mark. § 1125(c)(3)(C). Another protects a fair use of a mark in connection with parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or its goods. § 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii). The fair-use exclusion, though, comes with a caveat. A defendant cannot get its benefit—even if engaging in parody, criticism, or commentary —when using the similar-looking mark as a designation of source for the defendant's own goods. § 1125(c)(3)(A). In other words, the exclusion does not apply if the defendant uses the similar mark as a mark.",Kagan,0,

Most of the toys in the line are designed to look like—and to parody—popular beverage brands. There are, to take a sampling, Dos Perros (cf. Dos Equis), Smella Arpaw (cf. Stella Artois), and Doggie Walker (cf. Johnnie Walker). VIP has registered trademarks in all those names, as in the umbrella term Silly Squeakers.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,44,"In 2014, VIP added the Bad Spaniels toy to the line. VIP did not apply to register the name, or any other feature of, Bad Spaniels. But according to its complaint (further addressed below), VIP both owns and uses the `Bad Spaniels' trademark and trade dress. App. 3, 11, see infra, at 1585-1586, 1590-1591. And Bad Spaniels' trade dress, like the dress of many Silly Squeakers toys, is designed to evoke a distinctive beverage bottle-with-label. Even if you didn't already know, you'd probably not have much trouble identifying which one.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,45,"Bad Spaniels is about the same size and shape as an ordinary bottle of Jack Daniel's. The faux bottle, like the original, has a black label with stylized white text and a white filigreed border. The words Bad Spaniels replace Jack Daniel's in a like font and arch. Above the arch is an image of a spaniel. (This is a dog toy, after all.) Below the arch, The Old No. 2 On Your Tennessee Carpet replaces Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey in similar graphic form.

And at the top, most relevant here, are two product logos—on the left for the Silly Squeakers line, and on the right for the Bad Spaniels toy.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,48,"Soon after Bad Spaniels hit the market, Jack Daniel's sent VIP a letter demanding  that it stop selling the product. VIP responded by bringing this suit, seeking a declaratory judgment that Bad Spaniels neither infringed nor diluted Jack Daniel's trademarks. The complaint alleged, among other things, that VIP is the owner of all rights in its `Bad Spaniels' trademark and trade dress for its durable rubber squeaky novelty dog toy. App. 3, see supra, at 1584-1585. Jack Daniel's counterclaimed under the Lanham Act for both trademark infringement and trademark dilution by tarnishment.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,49,"VIP moved for summary judgment on both claims. First, VIP argued that Jack Daniel's infringement claim failed under a threshold test derived from the First Amendment to protect expressive works—like (VIP said) the Bad Spaniels toy. When those works are involved, VIP contended, the so-called Rogers test requires dismissal of an infringement claim at the outset unless the complainant can show one of two things: that the challenged use of a mark has no artistic relevance to the underlying work or that it explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work. Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994, 999 (C.A.2 1989) (NEWMAN, J.). Because Jack Daniel's could make neither showing, VIP argued, the likelihood-of-confusion issue became irrelevant. Second, VIP urged that Jack Daniel's could not succeed on a dilution claim because Bad Spaniels was a parody of Jack Daniel's, and therefore made fair use of its famous marks. § 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii).",Kagan,0,
2022-045,50,"The District Court rejected both contentions for a common reason: because VIP had used the cribbed Jack Daniel's features as trademarks—that is, to identify the source of its own products. In the court's view, when another's trademark is used for source identification—as the court thought was true here—the threshold Rogers test does not apply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a. Instead, the suit must address the standard infringement question: whether the use is likely to cause consumer confusion. Ibid. And likewise, VIP could not invoke the dilution provision's fair-use exclusion. Parodies fall within that exclusion, the court explained, only when the uses they make of famous marks do not serve as a designation of source for the alleged diluter's own goods. Id., at 104a (quoting § 1125(c)(3)(A)).",Kagan,0,
2022-045,51,"The case thus proceeded to a bench trial, where Jack Daniel's prevailed. The District Court found, based largely on survey evidence, that consumers were likely to be confused about the source of the Bad Spaniels toy. See 291 F.Supp.3d 891, 906-911 (D. Ariz. 2018). And the court thought that the toy, by creating negative associations with canine excrement, would cause Jack Daniel's reputational harm. Id., at 903, 905.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,52,"But the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that the District Court had gotten the pretrial legal issues wrong. In the Ninth Circuit's view, the infringement claim was subject to the threshold Rogers test because Bad Spaniels is an expressive work: Although just a dog toy, and surely not the equivalent of the Mona Lisa, it communicates a humorous message. 953 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals therefore returned the case to the District Court to decide whether Jack Daniel's could satisfy either of Rogers' two prongs. And the Ninth Circuit awarded judgment on the dilution claim to VIP. The court did not address the statutory exclusion for parody and other fair use, as the District Court had. Instead, the Court of Appeals held that the exclusion for noncommercial use shielded VIP from liability. § 1125(c)(3)(C). The use of a mark may be `noncommercial,'  the court reasoned, even if used to sell a product. 953 F.3d, at 1176 (internal quotation marks omitted). And here it was so, the court found, because it parodies and comments humorously on Jack Daniel's. Id., at 1175, see id., at 1176.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,53,"On remand, the District Court found that Jack Daniel's could not satisfy either prong of Rogers, and so granted summary judgment to VIP on infringement. Jack Daniel's appealed, and the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed.",Kagan,0,

2022-045,56,"Our first and more substantial question concerns Jack Daniel's infringement claim: Should the company have had to satisfy the Rogers threshold test before the case could proceed to the Lanham Act's likelihood-of-confusion inquiry?1 The parties address that issue in the broadest possible way, either attacking or defending Rogers in all its possible applications. Today, we choose a narrower path. Without deciding whether Rogers has merit in other contexts, we hold that it does not when an alleged infringer uses a trademark in the way the Lanham Act most cares about: as a designation of source for the infringer's own goods. See § 1127, supra, at 1582-1583. VIP used the marks derived from Jack Daniel's in that way, so the infringement claim here rises or falls on likelihood of confusion. But that inquiry is not blind to the expressive aspect of the Bad Spaniels toy that the Ninth Circuit highlighted. Beyond source designation, VIP uses the marks at issue in an effort to parody or make fun of Jack Daniel's. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58, 66. And that kind of message matters in assessing confusion because consumers are not so likely to think that the maker of a mocked product is itself doing the mocking.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,58,"To see why the Rogers test does not apply here, first consider the case from which it emerged. The defendants there had produced and distributed a film by Federico Fellini titled Ginger and Fred about two fictional Italian cabaret dancers (Pippo and Amelia) who imitated Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. When the film was released in the United States, Ginger Rogers objected under the Lanham Act to the use of her name. The Second Circuit rejected the claim. It reasoned that the titles of artistic works, like the works themselves, have an expressive element implicating First Amendment values. 875 F.2d, at 998. And at the same time, such names posed only a slight risk of confusing consumers about either the source or the content of the work. Id., at 999-1000. So, the court concluded, a threshold filter was appropriate. When a title with at least some artistic relevance was not explicitly misleading as to source or content, the claim could not go forward. Ibid. But the court made clear that it was not announcing a general rule. In the typical case, the court thought, the name of a product was more likely to indicate its source, and to be taken by consumers in just that way. See id., at 1000.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,59,"Over the decades, the lower courts adopting Rogers have confined it to similar cases, in which a trademark is used not to designate a work's source, but solely to perform some other expressive function.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,60,"So, for example, when the toymaker Mattel sued a band over the song Barbie Girl—with lyrics including Life in plastic, it's fantastic and I'm a blond bimbo girl, in a fantasy world—the Ninth Circuit applied Rogers. Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894, 901 (2002). That was because, the court reasoned, the band's use of the Barbie name was not as a source identifier: The use did not speak to the song's origin. Id., at 900, 902, see id., at 902 (a consumer would no more think that the song was produced by Mattel than would, upon hearing Janis Joplin croon `Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?,'  suspect that she and the carmaker had entered into a joint venture). Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed a suit under Rogers when a sports artist depicted the Crimson Tide's trademarked football uniforms solely to memorialize a notable event in football history. University of Ala. Bd. of Trustees v. New Life Art, Inc., 683 F.3d 1266, 1279 (2012). And when Louis Vuitton sued because a character in the film The Hangover: Part II described his luggage as a Louis Vuitton (though pronouncing it Lewis), a district court dismissed the complaint under Rogers. See Louis Vuitton Malletier S. A. v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 868 F.Supp.2d 172 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). All parties agreed that the film was not using the Louis Vuitton mark as its own identifying trademark. Id., at 180 (internal quotation marks omitted). When that is so, the court reasoned, confusion will usually be unlikely, and the interest in free expression counsels in favor of avoiding the standard Lanham Act test. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,61,"The same courts, though, routinely conduct likelihood-of-confusion analysis, without mentioning Rogers, when trademarks are used as trademarks—i.e., to designate source. See, e.g., JL Beverage Co., LLC v. Jim Beam Brands Co., 828 F.3d 1098, 1102-1103, 1106 (C.A.9 2016), PlayNation Play Systems, Inc. v. Velex Corp., 924 F.3d 1159, 1164-1165 (C.A.11 2019). And the Second Circuit—Rogers' home court— has made especially clear that Rogers does not apply in that context. For example, that court held that an offshoot political group's use of the trademark United We Stand America got no Rogers help because the use was as a source identifier. See United We Stand Am., Inc. v. United We Stand, Am. New York, Inc., 128 F.3d 86, 93 (1997). True, that slogan had expressive content. But the defendant group, the court reasoned, was using it as a mark, to suggest the same source identification as the original political movement. Ibid. And similarly, the Second Circuit (indeed, the judge who authored Rogers) rejected a motorcycle mechanic's view that his modified version of Harley Davidson's bar-and-shield logo was an expressive parody entitled to Rogers' protection. See Harley-Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli, 164 F.3d 806, 812-813 (1999). The court acknowledged that the mechanic's adapted logo conveyed a somewhat humorous message. Id., at 813. But his use of the logo was a quintessential trademark use: to brand his repair and parts business— through signage, a newsletter, and T-shirts —with images similar to Harley-Davidson's. Id., at 809, 812-813.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,62,"The point is that whatever you make of Rogers—and again, we take no position on that issue—it has always been a cabined doctrine. If we put this case to the side, the Rogers test has applied only to cases involving non-trademark uses—or otherwise said, cases in which the defendant has used the mark at issue in a non-source-identifying way. S. Dogan & M. Lemley, Grounding Trademark Law Through Trademark Use, 92 Iowa L. Rev. 1669, 1684 (2007), see id., at 1683-1684, and n. 58. The test has not insulated from  ordinary trademark scrutiny the use of trademarks as trademarks, to identify or brand a defendant's goods or services. Id., at 1683.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,63,"We offer as one last example of that limitation a case with a striking resemblance to this one. It too involved dog products, though perfumes rather than toys. Yes, the defendant sold a line of pet perfumes whose names parody elegant brands sold for human consumption. Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. v. Nature Labs, LLC, 221 F.Supp.2d 410, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (MUKASEY, J.). The product at issue was named Timmy Holedigger —which Tommy Hilfiger didn't much like. The defendant asked for application of Rogers. The court declined it, relying on Harley-Davidson. See 221 F.Supp.2d, at 414. Rogers, the court explained, kicks in when a suit involves solely nontrademark uses of a mark—that is, where the trademark is not being used to indicate the source or origin of a product, but only to convey a different kind of message. 221 F.Supp.2d, at 414. When, instead, the use is at least in part for source identification—when the defendant may be trading on the good will of the trademark owner to market its own goods—Rogers has no proper role. 221 F.Supp.2d, at 414-415. And that is so, the court continued, even if the defendant is also making an expressive comment, including a parody of a different product. Id., at 415. The defendant is still making trademark use of another's mark, and must meet an infringement claim on the usual battleground of likelihood of confusion. Id., at 416.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,64,"That conclusion fits trademark law, and reflects its primary mission. From its definition of trademark onward, the Lanham Act views marks as source identifiers—as things that function to indicate the source of goods, and so to distinguish them from ones manufactured or sold by others. § 1127, see supra, at 1583. The cardinal sin under the law, as described earlier, is to undermine that function. See supra, at 1583. It is to confuse consumers about source—to make (some of) them think that one producer's products are another's. And that kind of confusion is most likely to arise when someone uses another's trademark as a trademark—meaning, again, as a source identifier—rather than for some other expressive function. To adapt one of the cases noted above: Suppose a filmmaker uses a Louis Vuitton suitcase to convey something about a character (he is the kind of person who wants to be seen with the product but doesn't know how to pronounce its name). See supra, at 1588. Now think about a different scenario: A luggage manufacturer uses an ever-so-slightly modified LV logo to make inroads in the suitcase market. The greater likelihood of confusion inheres in the latter use, because it is the one conveying information (or misinformation) about who is responsible for a product. That kind of use implicates the core concerns of trademark law and creates the paradigmatic infringement case. G. Dinwoodie & M. Janis, Confusion Over Use: Contextualism in Trademark Law, 92 Iowa L. Rev. 1597, 1636 (2007). So the Rogers test— which offers an escape from the likelihood-of-confusion inquiry and a shortcut to dismissal —has no proper application.2  Nor does that result change because the use of a mark has other expressive content —i.e., because it conveys some message on top of source. Here is where we most dramatically part ways with the Ninth Circuit, which thought that because Bad Spaniels communicates a humorous message, it is automatically entitled to Rogers' protection. 953 F.3d, at 1175 (internal quotation marks omitted). On that view, Rogers might take over much of the world. For trademarks are often expressive, in any number of ways. Consider how one liqueur brand's trade dress (beyond identifying source) tells a story, with a bottle in the shape of a friar's habit connoting the product's olden monastic roots:",Kagan,0,
2022-045,65,"Or take a band name that not only identifies the band but expresses a view about social issues. Tam, 582 U.S., at 245, 137 S.Ct. 1744 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (discussing The Slants). Or note how a mark can both function as a mark and have parodic content—as the court found in the Hilfiger/Holedigger litigation. See supra, at 1588-1589. The examples could go on and on. As a leading treatise puts the point, the Ninth Circuit's expansion of Rogers potentially encompasses just about everything because names, phrases, symbols, designs, and their varied combinations often contain some `expressive' message unrelated to source. 6 McCarthy § 31:144.50. That message may well be relevant in assessing the likelihood of confusion between two marks, as we address below. See infra, at 1591-1592. But few cases would even get to the likelihood-of-confusion inquiry if all expressive content triggered the Rogers filter. In that event, the Rogers exception would become the general rule, in conflict with courts' longstanding view of trademark law.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,66,"The Ninth Circuit was mistaken to believe that the First Amendment demanded such a result. The court thought that trademark law would otherwise fail to account for the full weight of the public's interest in free expression. 953 F.3d, at 1174. But as the Mattel (i.e., Barbie) court noted, when a challenged trademark use functions as source-identifying, trademark rights play well with the First Amendment: Whatever first amendment rights you may have in calling the brew you make in your bathtub `Pepsi' are outweighed by the buyer's interest in not being fooled into buying it. 296 F.3d, at 900. Or in less colorful terms: To the extent a trademark is confusing as to a product's source the law can protect consumers and trademark owners. Tam, 582 U.S., at 252, 137 S.Ct. 1744 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), see Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 15, 99 S.Ct. 887, 59 L.Ed.2d 100 (1979) (rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a law restricting trade names because of the substantial interest in protecting the public from their deceptive and misleading use). Or yet again, in an especially clear rendering: The trademark law generally prevails over the First Amendment when another's trademark (or a confusingly similar mark) is used  without permission as a means of source identification. Yankee Publishing Inc. v. News Am. Publishing Inc., 809 F.Supp. 267, 276 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (LEVAL, J.) (emphasis deleted). So for those uses, the First Amendment does not demand a threshold inquiry like the Rogers test. When a mark is used as a mark (except, potentially, in rare situations), the likelihood-of-confusion inquiry does enough work to account for the interest in free expression.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,68,"Here, the District Court correctly held that VIP uses its Bad Spaniels trademark and trade dress as source identifiers of its dog toy. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a. In fact, VIP conceded that point below. In its complaint, VIP alleged that it both owns and uses the `Bad Spaniels' trademark and trade dress for its durable rubber squeaky novelty dog toy. App. 3, 11. The company thus represented in this very suit that the mark and dress, although not registered, are used to identify and distinguish VIP's goods and to indicate their source. § 1127. (Registration of marks, you'll recall, is optional. See supra, at 1583-1584.)",Kagan,0,
2022-045,69,"In this Court, VIP says the complaint was a mere form allegation—a matter of rote. Tr. of Oral Arg. 73. But even if we knew what that meant, VIP has said and done more in the same direction. First, there is the way the product is marketed. On the hangtag, the Bad Spaniels logo sits opposite the concededly trademarked Silly Squeakers logo, with both appearing to serve the same source-identifying function. See supra, at 1585. And second, there is VIP's practice as to other products in the Silly Squeakers line. The company has consistently argued in court that it owns, though has never registered, the trademark and trade dress in dog toys like Jose Perro (cf. Jose Cuervo) and HeinieSniff'n (cf. Heineken).3 And it has chosen to register the names of still other dog toys, including Dos Perros (#6176781), Smella Arpaw (#6262975), and Doggie Walker (#6213816). See supra, at 1585. Put all that together, and more than form or rote emerges: VIP's conduct is its own admission that it is using the Bad Spaniels (née Jack Daniel's) trademarks as trademarks, to identify product source.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,70,"Because that is so, the only question in this suit going forward is whether the Bad Spaniels marks are likely to cause confusion. There is no threshold test working to kick out all cases involving expressive works. But a trademark's expressive message—particularly a parodic one, as VIP asserts—may properly figure in assessing the likelihood of confusion. See, e.g., Louis Vuitton Malletier S. A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC, 507 F.3d 252, 265 (C.A.4 2007) (Parody influences the way in which the likelihood-of-confusion factors are applied), Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17-22 (same). A parody must conjure up enough of an original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 588, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet to succeed, the parody must also create contrasts, so that  its message of ridicule or pointed humor comes clear. And once that is done (if that is done), a parody is not often likely to create confusion. Self-deprecation is one thing, self-mockery far less ordinary. So although VIP's effort to ridicule Jack Daniel's does not justify use of the Rogers test, it may make a difference in the standard trademark analysis. Consistent with our ordinary practice, we remand that issue to the courts below. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (noting that this Court is generally a court of review, not of first view).",Kagan,0,
2022-045,72,"Our second question, more easily dispatched, concerns Jack Daniel's claim of dilution by tarnishment (for the linkage of its whiskey to less savory substances). Recall that the Ninth Circuit dismissed that claim based on one of the Lanham Act's exclusions from dilution liability—for any noncommercial use of a mark. § 1125(c)(3)(C), see supra, at 1586-1587. On the court's view, the use of a mark may be `noncommercial' even if used to sell a product. 953 F.3d, at 1176 (internal quotation marks omitted). And VIP's use is so, the court continued, because it parodies and conveys a humorous message about Jack Daniel's. Id., at 1175-1176. We need not express a view on the first step of that reasoning because we think the second step wrong. However wide the scope of the noncommercial use exclusion, it cannot include, as the Ninth Circuit thought, every parody or humorous commentary.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,73,"To begin to see why, consider the scope of another of the Lanham Act's exclusions —this one for any fair use. As described earlier, the fair use exclusion specifically covers uses parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon a famous mark owner. § 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii), see supra, at 1584-1585. But not in every circumstance. Critically, the fair-use exclusion has its own exclusion: It does not apply when the use is as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services. § 1125(c)(3)(A). In that event, no parody, criticism, or commentary will rescue the alleged dilutor. It will be subject to liability regardless.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,74,"The problem with the Ninth Circuit's approach is that it reverses that statutorily directed result, as this case illustrates. Given the fair-use provision's carve-out, parody (and criticism and commentary, humorous or otherwise) is exempt from liability only if not used to designate source. Whereas on the Ninth Circuit's view, parody (and so forth) is exempt always—regardless whether it designates source. The expansive view of the noncommercial use exclusion effectively nullifies Congress's express limit on the fair-use exclusion for parody, etc. Just consider how the Ninth Circuit's construction played out here. The District Court had rightly concluded that because VIP used the challenged marks as source identifiers, it could not benefit from the fair-use exclusion for parody. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a, supra, at 1585-1587, 1590-1592. The Ninth Circuit took no issue with that ruling. But it shielded VIP's parodic uses anyway. In doing so, the court negated Congress's judgment about when—and when not—parody (and criticism and commentary) is excluded from dilution liability.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,76,"Today's opinion is narrow. We do not decide whether the Rogers test is ever appropriate, or how far the noncommercial use exclusion goes. On infringement, we hold only that Rogers does not apply when the challenged use of a mark is as a mark. On dilution, we hold only that the  noncommercial exclusion does not shield parody or other commentary when its use of a mark is similarly source-identifying. It is no coincidence that both our holdings turn on whether the use of a mark is serving a source-designation function. The Lanham Act makes that fact crucial, in its effort to ensure that consumers can tell where goods come from.",Kagan,0,
2022-045,77,"For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Kagan,0,

2022-045,80,"I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to emphasize that in the context of parodies and potentially other uses implicating First Amendment concerns, courts should treat the results of surveys with particular caution. As petitioner did here, plaintiffs in trademark infringement cases often commission surveys that purport to show that consumers are likely to be confused by an allegedly infringing product. Like any other evidence, surveys should be understood as merely one piece of the multifaceted likelihood of confusion analysis. See, e.g., Uncommon, LLC v. Spigen, Inc., 926 F.3d 409, 425 (C.A.7 2019). Courts should also carefully assess the methodology and representativeness of surveys, as many lower courts already do. See, e.g., Water Pik, Inc. v. Med-Systems, Inc., 726 F.3d 1136, 1144-1150 (C.A.10 2013), Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc., 588 F.3d 97, 117 (C.A.2 2009).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-045,81,"When an alleged trademark infringement involves a parody, however, there is particular risk in giving uncritical or undue weight to surveys. Survey answers may reflect a mistaken belief among some survey respondents that all parodies require permission from the owner of the parodied mark. Some of the answers to the survey in this case illustrate this potential. See App. 81-82, n. 25 (`I'm sure the dog toy company that made this toy had to get Jack Daniel's permission and legal rights to essentially copy their product in dog toy form'), ibid. (`The bottle is mimicked after the Jack Daniel BBQ sauce. So they would hold the patent therefore you would have to ask permission to use the image'), see also Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Balducci Publications, 28 F.3d 769, 772-773, 775 (C.A.8 1994) (describing a similar situation). Plaintiffs can point to this misunderstanding of the legal framework as evidence of consumer confusion. Cleverly designed surveys could also prompt such confusion by making consumers think about complex legal questions around permission that would not have arisen organically out in the world.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-045,82,"Allowing such survey results to drive the infringement analysis would risk silencing a great many parodies, even ones that by other metrics are unlikely to result in the confusion about sourcing that is the core concern of the Lanham Act.

Today, the Court rightly concludes that, even taken on its own terms, Rogers does not apply to cases like the one before us. But in doing so, we necessarily leave much about Rogers unaddressed. For example, it is not entirely clear where the Rogers test comes from—is it commanded by the First Amendment, or is it merely gloss on the Lanham Act, perhaps inspired by constitutional-avoidance doctrine? Id., at 998. For another thing, it is not obvious that Rogers is correct in all its particulars —certainly, the Solicitor General raises serious questions about the decision.

2022-046,28,"The development of antibody drugs has yielded life-changing therapies. Individuals across the world now rely on antibody drugs to treat conditions ranging from Crohn's disease to cancer. This case concerns patents covering antibodies that help reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, sometimes called LDL cholesterol (for the obvious reason) or bad cholesterol (because it can lead to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,29,"The case comes to us this way. Several years ago, petitioners (Amgen) obtained two patents. Together, these patents claim a monopoly over all antibodies that (1) bind to specific amino acids on a naturally occurring protein known as PCSK9, and (2) block PCSK9 from impairing the body's mechanism for removing LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Soon after receiving these patents, Amgen sued respondents (Sanofi) for infringement. In response, Sanofi argued that the patents were invalid under § 112 of the Patent Act. That provision requires a patent applicant to describe its invention in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art  to make and use the invention. 35 U.S.C. § 112(a). Sanofi contended that Amgen's patents failed to meet this standard because they sought to claim for Amgen's exclusive use potentially millions more antibodies than the company had taught scientists to make. In the end, both the district court and Federal Circuit sided with Sanofi. The question we face is whether to disturb their judgment.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,32,"The immune system produces antibodies as a defense to foreign agents called antigens. When a particular antigen—a virus, for example—enters the body, the immune system generates antibodies to attack it.

This diversity shows up in both structure and function.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,34,"Start with structure. When scientists refer to an antibody's `structure,' they may have in mind several related concepts, each of which describes what an antibody is. Winter Brief 10. Antibodies are made up of amino acids, and scientists commonly identify a particular antibody according to its specific sequence of amino acids—what they call an antibody's `primary structure.' Id., at 9-10. But antibodies are not just linear chains of amino acids. As the atoms of the amino acids interact with each other, they create folds that result in complex three-dimensional shapes. Ibid. Scientists refer to an antibody's intricate topography as its tertiary structure. Id., at 10.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,35,"An antibody's structure does much to dictate its function—its ability to bind to  an antigen and, in some instances, to block other molecules in the body from doing the same. For an antibody to bind to an antigen, the two surfaces have to fit together and contact each other at multiple points. Id., at 11. But just because an antibody can bind to an antigen does not mean that it can also block. To bind and block, the antibody must establish a sufficiently broad, strong, and stable bond to the antigen. See ibid. Different antibodies have different binding and blocking capacities based on the amino acids that compose them and their three-dimensional shapes. See id., at 11-12.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,36,"Despite recent advances, aspects of antibody science remain unpredictable. For example, scientists understand that changing even one amino acid in the sequence can alter an antibody's structure and function. See id., at 14. But scientists cannot always accurately predict exactly how trading one amino acid for another will affect an antibody's structure and function. Ibid.

2022-046,39,"One part of this effort has focused on the creation of antibodies to treat patients with high LDL cholesterol. A silent killer, LDL cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries that may lead to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes. For many people with high LDL cholesterol, drugs called statins offer an effective treatment. For others, statins do not work well or come with unwelcome side effects. In those cases, a relatively new antibody-based treatment known as a PCSK9 inhibitor may be appropriate. See Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi, 872 F.3d 1367, 1371 (C.A. Fed. 2017).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,40,PCSK9 is a naturally occurring protein that binds to and degrades LDL receptors. That can pose a problem because the body produces LDL receptors to perform the beneficial function of extracting LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. See ibid. Scientists have understood this much for some time. But it wasn't until fairly recently that they began exploring how antibodies might be used to inhibit PCSK9 from binding to and degrading LDL receptors as a way to treat patients with high LDL cholesterol.,Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,41,"In the mid-2000s, a number of pharmaceutical companies began looking into the possibility of making antibodies to target PCSK9. See Brief for Respondents 7, Brief for Arnold Ventures et al. as Amici Curiae 17-20. More precisely, they sought to create antibodies that could bind to a particular region of PCSK9 called the sweet spot. See Brief for Petitioners 10-11. The sweet spot is a sequence of 15 amino acids out of PCSK9's 692 total amino acids. Id., at 11. By binding to the sweet spot, scientists found, an antibody could prevent PCSK9 from binding to and degrading LDL receptors. See id., at 10-11, Amgen, 872 F.3d, at 1371.",Gorsuch,0,

Patent No. 8,859,741 (Oct. 14, 2014). We refer to them as the '165 and '741 patents. In particular, this case revolves around claims 19 and 29 of the '165 patent and claim 7 of the '741 patent. See 987 F.3d 1080, 1082 (C.A. Fed. 2021). In these claims, Amgen did not seek protection for any particular antibody described by amino acid sequence. Instead, Amgen purported to claim for itself the entire genus of antibodies that (1) bind to specific amino acid residues on PCSK9, and (2) block PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. Amgen, 872 F.3d, at 1372.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,44,"As part of its submission to the patent office, Amgen identified the amino acid sequences of 26 antibodies that perform these two functions, and it depicted the three-dimensional structures of two of these 26 antibodies. 987 F.3d, at 1083. But beyond that, Amgen only offered scientists two methods to make other antibodies that perform the binding and blocking functions it described. The first method is what Amgen calls the roadmap. Brief for Petitioners 13. At a high level, the roadmap directs scientists to: (1) generate a range of antibodies in the lab, (2) test those antibodies to determine whether any bind to PCSK9, (3) test those antibodies that bind to PCSK9 to determine whether any bind to the sweet spot as described in the claims, and (4) test those antibodies that bind to the sweet spot as described in the claims to determine whether any block PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. See id., at 13-14. The second method is what Amgen calls conservative substitution. Id., at 14, 17. This technique requires scientists to: (1) start with an antibody known to perform the described functions, (2) replace select amino acids in the antibody with other amino acids known to have similar properties, and (3) test the resulting antibody to see if it also performs the described functions. See id., at 14-15.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,46,"Soon after receiving the '165 and '741 patents, Amgen sued Sanofi for infringing them. Sanofi replied that it was not liable to Amgen because the relevant claims were invalid as a matter of law. Invalid, Sanofi said, because Amgen had not enabled a person skilled in the art to make and use all of the antibodies that perform the two functions Amgen described in its claims. See 987 F.3d, at 1083-1085. While Amgen had identified the amino acid sequences of 26 antibodies that bind to PCSK9 and block it from binding to LDL receptors, Sanofi observed that Amgen's claims cover potentially millions more undisclosed antibodies that perform these same functions. And, Sanofi argued, neither of the two methods Amgen had outlined for generating additional antibodies with the same functions enable a person skilled in the art to do so reliably. Instead, Sanofi submitted, those methods require scientists to engage in little more than a trial-and-error process of discovery. See id., at 1085.",Gorsuch,0,

Act of Apr. 10, 1790, § 1, 1 Stat. 110. Reflecting the quid-pro-quo premise of patent law, the statute required the applicant to deposit with the Secretary of State a specification  so particular as not only to distinguish the invention or discovery from other things before known and used, but also to enable a workman or other person skilled in the art or manufacture  to make, construct, or use the same. § 2, ibid.

So today, just as in 1790, the law secures for the public its benefit of the patent bargain by ensuring that, upon the expiration of the patent, the knowledge of the invention inures to the people, who are thus enabled without restriction to practice it.

By 1837, Morse had a solution: combining two or more electric or galvanic circuits, with independent batteries for the purpose of overcoming the diminished force of electro-magnetism in long circuits.

2022-046,59,"Consider, too, Incandescent Lamp. For much of the 19th century, gas lamps helped illuminate streets and supplemented candles inside homes, factories, offices, and theaters. But gas lighting had drawbacks. It took effort to ignite lamps each night and extinguish them each morning. Then there were the problems of soot and fumes. See R. Stross, The Wizard of Menlo Park 84-85 (2007) (Stross). By the 1870s, many had experimented with other forms of lighting, including incandescence and the arc light. 159 U.S., at 470, 16 S.Ct. 75. But these alternatives burned unreliably or with unbearable brightness. See id., at 470-471, 16 S.Ct. 75.

2022-046,60,"Enter Thomas Edison. From his laboratory in Menlo Park, Edison and a team toiled to improve upon the prevailing method of incandescent lighting, which tended to employ carbon filaments. 159 U.S., at 471-473, 16 S.Ct. 75. The problem with carbon filaments was that they disintegrated rapidly. In a sense, carbon contained in itself the elements of its own destruction. Id., at 471, 16 S.Ct. 75. Seeking an alternative, Edison tinkered for a time with platinum, but it was expensive and difficult to bring to the point of incandescence without melting. Stross 78, 82.

One sample from Japan worked brilliantly because its fibres ran more nearly parallel than in other species of wood. 159 U.S., at 473, 16 S.Ct. 75.

2022-046,61,"But there was a catch. William Sawyer and Albon Man had obtained a patent for an `electric lamp' with an `incandescing conductor' made of `carbonized fibrous or textile material,' which they claimed was an improvement over conductors made of `mineral or gas carbon.' 159 U.S., at 466, 468, 16 S.Ct. 75.

What was that offending material? Bamboo.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,62,"This Court sided with Edison. It held that Sawyer and Man's patent claimed much but enabled little.

But instead of confining themselves to carbonized paper, as they might properly have done, and in fact did in their third claim, they made a broad claim for every fibrous and textile material. Ibid. Even that broad claim might have been permissible, the Court allowed, if Sawyer and Man had disclosed a quality common to fibrous and textile substances that made them peculiarly adapted to incandescent  lighting. Ibid. Had they done so, others would have known how to select among such materials to make an operable lamp. But the record showed that most fibrous and textile materials failed to work. Only through painstaking experimentation did Edison discover that bamboo answered the required purpose. Id., at 475-476, 16 S.Ct. 75.

2022-046,63,"The Court returned to these principles in Holland Furniture. There, the evidence indicated that animal glue has properties that have long made it excellent for wood veneering.

Seeking a substitute, Perkins Glue Company had developed and patented a starch glue similar enough to animal glue that craftsmen could also use it for wood veneering. See ibid. Yet Perkins's patent included a claim that went beyond the specific starch glue it manufactured. See id., at 250-251, 48 S.Ct. 474. This claim covered all starch glue which, when combined with about three parts or less by weight of water, will have substantially the same properties as animal glue. Id., at 251, 48 S.Ct. 474. Perkins's specification instructed gluemakers to choose a starch ingredient with such qualities that it would yield a product `as good as animal glue' for wood veneering when combined with three parts of water and with alkali.

2022-046,64,"The Court held this broad claim invalid for lack of enablement. Id., at 258, 48 S.Ct. 474. The specification described the key input—the starch ingredient—in terms of its use or function rather than its physical characteristics or chemical properties. Id., 256, 48 S.Ct. 474. And that left gluemakers in a bind. As the Court put it: One attempting to use or avoid the use of Perkins' discovery as so claimed and described functionally could do so only after elaborate experimentation with different starches. Id., at 257, 48 S.Ct. 474. To be sure, the Court held, Perkins was entitled to its patent on the specific starch glue it had invented. See id., at 255, 48 S.Ct. 474. The specification described that glue's characteristic ingredient with particularity. Ibid. But just as Morse could not claim all means of telegraphic communication, and Sawyer and Man could not claim all fibrous and textile materials for incandescence, Perkins could not claim all starch glues made from whatever starch happened to perform as well as animal glue.

2022-046,65,"Our decisions in Morse, Incandescent Lamp, and Holland Furniture reinforce the simple statutory command. If a patent claims an entire class of processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter, the patent's specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the entire class. In other words, the specification must enable the full scope of the invention as defined by its claims. The more one claims, the more one must enable.

Similarly, in Minerals Separation, the Court dismissed a challenge to a claimed process for separating metal from mineral ores. 242 U.S., at 270, 37 S.Ct. 82. The record showed that preliminary tests were required to adapt the process to any particular ore. Ibid. Once more, the Court explained that the certainty which the law requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable. Ibid. And because the composition of ores varies infinitely, it was impossible to specify in a patent the precise treatment which would be most successful and economical in each case. Id., at 271, 37 S.Ct. 82.2",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,69,"Decisions such as Wood and Minerals Separation establish that a specification may call for a reasonable amount of experimentation to make and use a patented invention. What is reasonable in any case will depend on the nature of the invention and the underlying art. See Minerals Separation, 242 U.S., at 270-271, 37 S.Ct. 82, see also Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 644, 20 L.Ed. 860 (1872) (The definiteness of a specification must vary with the nature of its subject. Addressed as it is to those skilled in the art, it may leave something to their skill in applying the invention.). But in allowing that much tolerance, courts cannot detract from the basic statutory requirement that a patent's specification describe the invention in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. § 112(a). Judges may no more subtract from the requirements for obtaining a patent that Congress has prescribed than they may add to them. See Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 602-603, 612, 130 S.Ct. 3218, 177 L.Ed.2d 792 (2010).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,71,"With these principles in mind, we return to claims 19 and 29 of the '165 patent and claim 7 of the '741 patent. In doing so, we do not doubt that Amgen's specification enables the 26 exemplary antibodies it identifies by their amino acid sequences. Even Sanofi concedes that description is enough to allow a person skilled in the art to make and use those embodiments. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 68. But the claims before us sweep much broader than those 26 antibodies. And we agree with the lower courts that Amgen has failed to enable all that it has claimed, even allowing for a reasonable degree of experimentation.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,72,"While the technology at the heart of this case is thoroughly modern, from the law's perspective Amgen's claims bear more than a passing resemblance to those this Court faced long ago in Morse, Incandescent Lamp, and Holland Furniture. Amgen seeks to monopolize an entire class of things defined by their function—every antibody that both binds to particular areas of the sweet spot of PCSK9 and blocks PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. The record reflects that this class of antibodies does not include just the 26 that Amgen has described by their amino acid sequences, but a vast number of additional antibodies that it has not. 987 F.3d, at 1085, 1088, see 2019 WL 4058927, *8 (at least millions of candidates), see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53. Much as Morse sought to claim all telegraphic forms of communication, Sawyer and Man sought to claim all fibrous and textile materials for incandescence, and Perkins sought to claim all starch glues that work as well as animal glue for wood veneering, Amgen seeks to claim sovereignty over an entire kingdom of antibodies. Incandescent Lamp, 159 U.S., at 476, 16 S.Ct. 75.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,73,"That poses Amgen with a challenge. For if our cases teach anything, it is that the more a party claims, the broader the monopoly it demands, the more it must enable. That holds true whether the case involves telegraphs devised in the 19th century, glues invented in the 20th, or antibody treatments developed in the 21st. To be fair, Amgen does not dispute this much. It freely admits that it seeks to claim for itself an entire universe of antibodies. Still, it says, its broad claims are enabled because scientists can make and use every undisclosed but functional antibody if they simply follow the company's roadmap or its proposal for conservative substitution.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,74,"We cannot agree. These two approaches amount to little more than two research assignments. The first merely describes step-by-step Amgen's own trial-and-error method for finding functional antibodies— calling on scientists to create a wide range of candidate antibodies and then screen each to see which happen to bind to PCSK9 in the right place and block it from binding to LDL receptors. See Part I-B, supra, 987 F.3d, at 1088, 2019 WL 4058927, *10-*13. The second isn't much different. It requires scientists to make substitutions to the amino acid sequences of antibodies known to work and then test the resulting antibodies to see if they do too—an uncertain prospect given the state of the art. See Parts I-A, I-B, supra, 987 F.3d, at 1088, 2019 WL 4058927, *10-*13. Whether methods like a roadmap or conservative substitution might suffice to enable other claims in other patents—perhaps because, as this Court suggested in Incandescent Lamp, the inventor identifies a quality common to every functional embodiment, supra, at 1254-1255—they do not here. They leave a scientist about where Sawyer and Man left Edison: forced to engage in painstaking experimentation to see what works. 159 U.S., at 475,  16 S.Ct. 75. That is not enablement. More nearly, it is a hunting license. Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 536, 86 S.Ct. 1033, 16 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,75,"Think about it this way. Imagine a combination lock with 100 tumblers, each of which can be set to 20 different positions. Brief for Intellectual Property Law Professors and Scholars as Amici Curiae 20. Through trial and error, imagine that an inventor finds and discloses 26 different successful lock combinations. Ibid. But imagine, too, that the inventor tries to claim much more, namely all successful combinations, while instructing others to randomly try a large set of combinations and then record the successful ones. Id., at 21. Sure enough, that kind of roadmap would produce functional combinations. Ibid. But it would not enable others to make and use functional combinations, it would instead leave them to random trial-and-error discovery. Ibid. Like many analogies, this one may oversimplify a bit, but it captures the gist of the problem.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,76,"Failing in its primary argument that it has enabled all of the antibodies it claims, Amgen tries a few alternative lines of attack. First, it suggests that the Federal Circuit erred by applying an enablement test unmoored from the statutory text. As Amgen sees it, that court conflated the question whether an invention is enabled with the question how long may it take a person skilled in the art to make every embodiment within a broad claim. See Brief for Petitioners 24-29, see also id., at 2, 19-20, 30-36. We do not see it that way. While we agree with Amgen that enablement is not measured against the cumulative time and effort it takes to make every embodiment within a claim, we are not so sure the Federal Circuit thought otherwise. That court went out of its way to say that it does not hold that the effort required to exhaust a genus is dispositive. 987 F.3d, at 1088 (emphasis deleted). Instead, the court stressed, the problem it saw is the same problem we see: Amgen offers persons skilled in the art little more than advice to engage in trial and error. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In any event, we review judgments of the lower courts, not statements in their opinions. See Black v. Cutter Laboratories, 351 U.S. 292, 297, 76 S.Ct. 824, 100 L.Ed. 1188 (1956).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,77,"Taking a similar tack, Amgen next argues that the Federal Circuit erroneously raised the bar for enablement of claims that, like Amgen's, encompass an entire genus of embodiments defined by their function. Brief for Petitioners 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is impermissible, Amgen argues, because the Patent Act provides a single, universal enablement standard for all inventions. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, too, we agree with Amgen in principle: There is one statutory enablement standard. But, once more, we do not understand the Federal Circuit to have thought differently. Instead, we understand that court to have recognized only that the more a party claims for itself the more it must enable. As we have seen, that much is entirely consistent with Congress's directive and this Court's precedents.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-046,78,"Finally, Amgen warns that an affirmance risks destroying incentives for breakthrough inventions. Id., at 38. But striking the proper balance between incentivizing inventors and ensuring the public receives the full benefit of their innovations is a policy judgment that belongs to Congress. Since 1790, Congress has included an enablement mandate as one feature among many designed to achieve the balance it wishes. Our only duty in this case lies in applying that mandate faithfully.*  Section 112 of the Patent Act reflects Congress's judgment that if an inventor claims a lot, but enables only a little, the public does not receive its benefit of the bargain. For more than 150 years, this Court has enforced the statutory enablement requirement according to its terms. If the Court had not done so in Incandescent Lamp, it might have been writing decisions like Holland Furniture in the dark. Today's case may involve a new technology, but the legal principle is the same. The judgment is",Gorsuch,0,

2022-047,27,"In this case, we consider whether § 924(c)'s bar on concurrent sentences extends to a sentence imposed under a different subsection: § 924(j). We hold that it does not. A sentence for a § 924(j) conviction therefore can run either concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,29,"In 2002, members of a drug-dealing group from the Bronx assassinated a rival drug dealer. The Government accused petitioner Efrain Lora of being one of the group's leaders and acting as a scout during the fatal shooting. After a jury trial, Lora was convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of § 924(j)(1), which penalizes a person who, in the course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person through the use of a firearm, where the killing is a murder. See also § 2(a) (an aider and abettor is punishable as a principal). Lora was also convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,30,"At sentencing, the District Court rejected two of Lora's arguments about his § 924(j) conviction. Most pertinent here, Lora argued that the District Court had discretion to run the § 924(j) sentence concurrently  with the drug-distribution-conspiracy sentence. The District Court held it lacked such discretion. Applying Circuit precedent, it held that § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s bar on concurrent sentences governs § 924(j) sentences, such that Lora's two sentences had to run consecutively. See United States v. Barrett, 937 F.3d 126, 129, n. 2 (C.A.2 2019). Lora also argued that a § 924(j) conviction is not subject to the mandatory minimum sentences specified in § 924(c). Disagreeing once again, the District Court applied the five-year mandatory minimum under § 924(c)(1)(A) to Lora's sentencing calculation.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,31,The District Court ultimately sentenced Lora to 30 years of imprisonment: 25 years on the drug-distribution- conspiracy count and—consecutively—five years on the § 924(j) count. Lora also received five years of supervised release.,Jackson,0,

2022-047,36,"Subsection (c) lays out a set of offenses and their corresponding penalties. It begins by making it a crime either to use or carry a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, or to possess a firearm in furtherance of any such crime. § 924(c)(1)(A). The provision then prescribes a term of imprisonment for that offense: a minimum of five years. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).",Jackson,0,
2022-047,37,"Other (more serious) offense elements and terms of imprisonment follow within subsection (c). If the firearm is brandished, the term of imprisonment jumps to a minimum of seven years. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).

2022-047,38,"Subsection (c) also provides that no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person. § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii). In other words, the sentence must run consecutively, not concurrently, in relation to other sentences. This concurrent-sentence bar (or consecutive-sentence mandate) is at issue in this case.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,39,Subsection (j) was added decades after subsection (c) and its consecutive-sentence mandate.2 Subsection (j) likewise lays out  offense elements and corresponding penalties. It provides:,Jackson,0,

2022-047,43,Subsection (j) contains no consecutive-sentence mandate.,Jackson,0,
2022-047,45,"Here, Lora was convicted of a subsection (j) offense. The parties dispute whether the sentence for that offense can run concurrently with another sentence, or whether it is subject to subsection (c)'s consecutive-sentence mandate. We hold the former.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,46,"Subsection (c)'s consecutive-sentence requirement applies to a term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection —i.e., subsection (c). § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) (emphasis added). By those plain terms, Congress applied the consecutive-sentence mandate only to terms of imprisonment imposed under that subsection. And Congress put subsection (j) in a different subsection of the statute.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,47,"Drilling into the details confirms that straightforward reasoning. To begin, subsection (c) sets forth a host of offenses and the corresponding terms of imprisonment to be imposed. §§ 924(c)(1), (5), supra, at 1716-1717. Those are the terms of imprisonment imposed  under this subsection that the consecutive-sentence mandate references. § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii). That is, by echoing the phrase term of imprisonment and referring inwards to this subsection, § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) points to the terms of imprisonment prescribed within subsection (c).",Jackson,0,
2022-047,48,"A sentence imposed under subsection (j) does not qualify. To state the obvious again, subsection (j) is not located within subsection (c). Nor does subsection (j) call for imposing any sentence from subsection (c). Instead, subsection (j) provides its own set of penalties. See §§ 924(j)(1)-(2).",Jackson,0,
2022-047,49,"To be sure, subsection (j) references subsection (c). But it does so only with respect to offense elements, not penalties. Subsection (j)'s offense elements include causing death in the course of a violation of subsection (c). § 924(j). And to define that phrase, one must consult subsection (c)'s offense elements (i.e., what it takes to violate that subsection). But that is where subsection (c)'s role in subsection (j) stops. One need not consult subsection (c)'s sentences in order to sentence a subsection (j) defendant.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,50,"Thus, a defendant who is sentenced under subsection (j) does not receive a term of imprisonment imposed  under subsection (c). Consequently, § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)'s consecutive-sentence mandate does not apply.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,53,"The Government tries to deflect this conclusion by blending subsections (c) and (j) together. It claims that Congress incorporated Section 924(c) as a whole into Section 924(j). Brief for United States 15. Under that view, a subsection (j) defendant faces subsection (j)'s penalties plus subsection (c)'s penalties—including subsection (c)'s mandatory minimum sentences and its consecutive-sentence mandate.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,54,"The actual statute bears no resemblance to the Government's vision. Subsection (j)  nowhere mentions—let alone incorporates —subsection (c)'s penalties. Instead, as just explained, subsection (j)'s only reference to subsection (c) is limited to offense elements. Supra this page.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,55,"Moreover, a sentencing court cannot follow both subsection (c) and subsection (j) as written. Combining the two subsections would set them on a collision course, indeed, in some cases, the maximum sentence would be lower than the minimum sentence. Take voluntary manslaughter using a machinegun in the course of a subsection (c)(1) violation, for example. Subsection (c), because of the machinegun, would command that the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 30 years. § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii). Subsection (j), because of the voluntary manslaughter, would command that, per § 1112, the person shall be  imprisoned not more than 15 years. §§ 924(j)(2), 1112(b). To fashion a sentence not less than 30 years and not more than 15 years—that is, to obey both subsections (c) and (j)—is impossible. And Congress has not required that unachievable result. Instead, subsection (j) supplies its own comprehensive set of penalties that apply instead of subsection (c)'s.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,56,"To avert potential conflict between subsections (c) and (j), the Government tries to knit the two provisions together in a very particular way. In the Government's view, a court sentencing a subsection (j) defendant should jump to subsection (c), apply the penalties listed there, then jump back to subsection (j) and add the penalties listed there, then jump back to subsection (c) and impose the consecutive- sentence mandate listed in that subsection. But nothing in subsection (j) calls for such calisthenics.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,57,"To assuage that concern, the Government maintains that Congress has done this elsewhere, it says that another provision, § 924(c)(5), operates this way. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, 31.

2022-047,64,"According to the Government, § 924(c)(5) adds two penalties together when death results: Someone convicted of murder resulting from the use of such ammunition faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence under § 924(c)(5)(A) plus an additional sentence for murder under § 924(c)(5)(B)(i). Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, 31.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,65,"But subsection (j) is cast from a different mold. Section 924(c)(5) groups the two penalties together and joins them with the word and. In contrast, several unrelated subsections separate subsections (c) and (j) structurally, and nothing joins their penalties textually. So even if those features of § 924(c)(5) make it operate as the Government contends, those aspects of § 924(c)(5) are missing from subsection (j).",Jackson,0,
2022-047,66,"In the Government's own telling, then, § 924(c)(5) shows how Congress could have constructed penalties that might ultimately add together. Yet Congress did not implement that design in subsection (j).",Jackson,0,
2022-047,67,Equally unavailing is the Government's invocation of double jeopardy principles.,Jackson,0,
2022-047,68,"According to the Government's brief, Section 924(j) amounts to the `same offense' as Section 924(c) for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, so a defendant may be punished for either a Section 924(c) offense or a Section 924(j) offense, but not both. Brief for United States 22-26 (emphasis added, alterations and some internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that this conception of double jeopardy confirms subsection (j) incorporates all of subsection (c). Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,69,"We express no position on the Government's view of double jeopardy, because even assuming it, arguendo, the Government's view does not refute our holding on the question presented. The Government says someone cannot receive both subsection (c) and subsection (j) sentences for the same conduct. But that aligns with our conclusion here: If a defendant receives a sentence under subsection (j), he does not receive a sentence imposed  under subsection (c) that would trigger the consecutive-sentence mandate. § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Accordingly, the Government's view of double jeopardy can easily be squared with our view that subsection (j) neither incorporates subsection (c)'s penalties nor triggers the consecutive-sentence mandate.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,71,"The Government protests that it is implausible that Congress imposed the harsh consecutive-sentence mandate under subsection (c) but not subsection (j), which covers more serious offense conduct. Brief for United States 9, 28-35. Yet that result is consistent with other design features of the statute.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,72,"Congress plainly chose a different approach to punishment in subsection (j) than in subsection (c). Subsection (c), first enacted in 1968, is full of mandatory penalties. It contains mandatory minimum years of imprisonment and mandatory consecutive sentences. In fact, when subsection (j) was enacted in 1994, subsection (c) specified not just mandatory minimums, but exact mandatory terms of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (e.g., exactly five years of imprisonment for the base subsection (c) offense).",Jackson,0,
2022-047,73,"Subsection (j), by contrast, generally eschews mandatory penalties in favor of sentencing flexibility. Unlike subsection (c), subsection (j) contains no mandatory minimums. Even for murder, subsection (j) expressly permits a sentence of any term of years. § 924(j)(1) (emphasis added). This follows the same pattern as several other provisions enacted alongside subsection (j) in the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1959. In those provisions, as in § 924(j)(1), Congress authorized the death penalty, but also a flexible range of lesser sentences for any term of years, with no mandatory minimum or consecutive-sentence mandate.3 In the same law, Congress also enacted a provision allowing judges to go below the otherwise-mandatory minimum sentence in certain cases.4 Given those choices to favor sentencing flexibility over mandatory penalties, it is not implausible, as the Government asserts, that subsection (j) permits flexibility to choose between concurrent and consecutive sentences.",Jackson,0,
2022-047,74,"Nor is that flexibility incompatible with the seriousness of subsection (j) offenses. Subsection (j) merely reflects the seriousness of the offense using a different approach than subsection (c)'s mandatory penalties. For murder, subsection (j) authorizes the harshest maximum penalty  possible: death. § 924(j)(1). And for manslaughter, subsection (j) imposes the same harsh punishment that the Federal Criminal Code prescribes for other manslaughters. See § 924(j)(2) (aligning penalties with § 1112).5",Jackson,0,
2022-047,75,Congress could certainly have designed the penalty scheme at issue here differently. It could have mandated harsher punishment under subsection (j) than under subsection (c).

2022-048,41,"We start with the Venue Clause, which concerns the place where a trial must be held. That Clause mandates that the Trial of all Crimes  shall be held in the State where the  Crimes shall have been committed. Art. III, § 2, cl. 3.4 Nothing about the language that frames this requirement suggests that a new trial in the proper venue is not an adequate remedy for its violation.",Alito,0,
2022-048,42,"Smith contends that the purpose of the Venue Clause supports his argument, but that argument is unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, the purpose he attributes to the Clause is insufficient to justify a departure from the general retrial rule. Smith primarily argues that the Venue Clause aims to prevent the infliction of additional harm on a defendant who has already undergone the hardship of an initial trial in a distant and improper place. But any criminal trial, whether or not in the right venue, imposes hardship, and any retrial after a reversal for trial error adds to that initial harm. Indeed, in some cases, the lost time, emotional burden, and expense of a flawed initial trial in a defendant's  home State may exceed the hardship of an initial trial in a State that is nearby but improper under the Venue Clause. And the mere burden of a second trial has never justified an exemption from the retrial rule. See Ewell, 383 U.S., at 121, 86 S.Ct. 773.",Alito,0,
2022-048,43,"Second, Smith's argument exaggerates the connection between the venue right and the hardship of trial in an improper venue. The most convenient trial venue for a defendant would presumably be where he lives, and yet the Venue Clause is keyed to the location of the alleged Crimes, Art. III, § 2, cl. 3, not the district where the accused resides, or even  the district in which he is personally at the time of committing the crime, In re Palliser, 136 U. S. 257, 265, 10 S.Ct. 1034, 34 L.Ed. 514 (1890). Thus, the Clause does not allow variation  for convenience of the  accused. Johnston v. United States, 351 U.S. 215, 221, 76 S.Ct. 739, 100 L.Ed. 1097 (1956), accord, e.g., Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U.S. 56, 77, 28 S.Ct. 428, 52 L.Ed. 681 (1908). The State in which a crime is committed may be far from a defendant's residence. For example, a resident of New York charged with committing a crime during a short visit to Hawaii may be tried in Hawaii under the Venue Clause even though that trial may be very inconvenient. Equally telling, the Clause would preclude trial for that crime in New York unless it somehow extended to the State. See, e.g., Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634-637, 81 S.Ct. 358, 5 L.Ed.2d 340 (1961) (holding that prosecution was proper only in Washington, D. C., rather than in the defendant's residence in Colorado), United States v. Lombardo, 241 U.S. 73, 76-78, 36 S.Ct. 508, 60 L.Ed. 897 (1916) (holding the same for a defendant who resided in Washington State). If avoiding hardship to a defendant were a core purpose of the Venue Clause, Brief for Petitioner 18, such results would be inexplicable.",Alito,0,
2022-048,44,"This disconnect between the State where trial would be least burdensome and the State where a crime was committed is exacerbated by the fact that many federal crimes occur in multiple States. We have held that a trial may be held `where any part' of a crime `can be proved to have been done.' United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 281, 119 S.Ct. 1239, 143 L.Ed.2d 388 (1999) (quoting Lombardo, 241 U.S., at 77, 36 S.Ct. 508). As a result, the Venue Clause permits a defendant charged with conspiracy to be tried in any State in which any co-conspirator took any overt act in furtherance of the endeavor, Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 365-367, 32 S.Ct. 793, 56 L.Ed. 1114 (1912), and a defendant charged with illegally shipping goods may be tried in any State through which the goods were illegally transported, Armour Packing, 209 U.S., at 76-77, 28 S.Ct. 428.

2022-048,45,"The Vicinage Clause provides no stronger textual support for petitioner's argument. That Clause guarantees the right to  an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed. Amdt. 6. The coverage of this Clause reinforces the coverage of the Venue Clause because, in protecting the right to a jury drawn from the place where a crime occurred, it functionally prescribes the place where a trial must be held. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S., at 278, 119 S.Ct. 1239, Travis, 364 U.S., at 634, 81 S.Ct. 358, see, e.g., Palliser, 136 U.S., at 265, 10 S.Ct. 1034. But the Vicinage Clause differs from the Venue Clause in two ways:  it concerns jury composition, not the place where a trial may be held, and it narrows the place where trial is permissible by specifying that a jury must be drawn from the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed. Amdt. 6 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-048,46,"Nothing about these differences dictates a remedy that is broader than the one awarded when the Venue Clause is violated. The vicinage right is only one aspect of the jury-trial rights protected by the Sixth Amendment, and we have repeatedly acknowledged that retrials are the appropriate remedy for violations of other jury-trial rights. See, e.g., Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 1390, 1406-07, 206 L.Ed.2d 583 (2020) (non-unanimous jury), Pena-Rodriguez v.

Most analogous to the case before us, we have recognized that retrial is the appropriate remedy when a defendant is tried by a jury that does not reflect a fair cross-section of the community. See, e.g., Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 85-87, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). There is no reason to conclude that trial before a jury drawn from the wrong geographic area demands a different remedy than trial before a jury drawn inadequately from within the community.",Alito,0,

2022-048,50,"In examining this history, the relevant starting point, as both parties agree, is the common-law vicinage right, which presumptively entitled defendants to a jury of the neighbourhood where the crime was allegedly committed. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 344 (1769) (Blackstone). As a practical matter, this right imposed a venue requirement: trials needed to be held at the location where the matter of fact issuable allegedly occurred to allow the Inhabitants whereof to serve on the jury. 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England § 193, at 125 (1628) (Coke).5",Alito,0,
2022-048,51,"Both of these requirements were well settled by the founding. See, e.g., Rex v. Harris, 3 Burr. 1330, 1334, 97 Eng. Rep. 858, 860 (K. B. 1762) (WILMOT, J.) (opining that there was no rule better established than `that all causes shall be tried in the county, and by the neighbourhood of the place, where the fact is committed'). Smith contends, however, that the Constitution not only incorporated this right but elevated it to an even higher stature in American law, and that this enhanced right favors his preferred remedy. Brief for Petitioner 21. The historical record, however, does not support this argument.",Alito,0,
2022-048,52,"There is no question that the founding generation enthusiastically embraced the vicinage right and wielded it as a political argument of the Revolution.6 Prior to the Revolution, Parliament enacted measures  to circumvent local trials before colonial juries, most notably by authorizing trials in England for both British soldiers charged with murdering colonists and colonists accused of treason.7 The Continental Congress and colonial legislatures forcefully objected to trials in England before loyalist juries, characterizing the practice as an affront to the existing common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by  peers of the vicinage.8 The Declaration of Independence also denounced these laws, under which, it said, British soldiers were protected  by a mock Trial and colonists were transported beyond the Seas to be tried for pretended offences.9 As States declared independence, most incorporated some form of a venue or vicinage clause in their governing documents, but none of these provisions specified a particular remedy for violations.10",Alito,0,
2022-048,53,"The common-law vicinage right, both as a jury requirement and as a proxy for venue, remained prominent during debates over the ratification of the Constitution. As originally proposed, the Constitution contained only the Venue Clause, which, as noted, says nothing about jury composition. Appealing to ancient common law, Anti-Federalists objected to this omission.11 Federalists responded that Congress could secure the vicinage right by statute, analogizing to common law, where the preservation of this right was in the hands of Parliament.12",Alito,0,
2022-048,54,"After the ratification of the Constitution, Congress yielded in part to the Anti-Federalists' argument and included a vicinage  right in the Sixth Amendment. James Madison's initial draft of the Amendment required a jury of the vicinage, 1 Annals of Cong. 435 (1789), but Congress amended that language so that it guaranteed a jury from the State of the crime and from any smaller judicial districts that Congress chose to create.13",Alito,0,
2022-048,55,"This history tells us two important things about the way in which the Constitution dealt with the common-law vicinage right. First, the right was highly prized by the founding generation, and this right undoubtedly inspired the Venue and Vicinage Clauses. Second, although the Clauses depart in some respects from the common law—most notably by providing new specifications about the place where a crime may be tried—there is no meaningful evidence that the Constitution altered the remedy prescribed by common law for violations of the vicinage right.",Alito,0,
2022-048,57,"With this background in mind, we examine the remedy at common law for an initial trial in the wrong venue or before a jury drawn from the wrong vicinage, and we find that this history does not demand a departure from the retrial rule. By the time of the founding, compelling evidence supported the conclusion that pleas of prior acquittal or conviction could not be grounded on a verdict issued in or returned by a jury from the wrong vicinage.",Alito,0,
2022-048,58,"The leading decision at common law was Arundel's Case, 6 Co. Rep. 14a, 77 Eng. Rep. 273 (K. B. 1593), which concerned a vicinage challenge to a jury that had found the defendant guilty of murder. Id., at 14a-14b, 77 Eng. Rep., at 274. The King's Bench arrested judgment on the conviction because the jury was insufficiently local, but it did not bar retrial. Ibid. Instead, a new venire facias was awarded to try the issue again. Ibid., see also Vaux's Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44a, 45a, 76 Eng. Rep. 992, 994 (K. B. 1591) (adopting a similar rationale for insufficient indictments). Discussing Arundel's Case at length, Sir Edward Coke's 17th-century treatise agreed that juries lacked authority to convict outside of their vicinage and added that a verdict by an improperly constituted jury would cause a mistryall. 1 Coke § 193, at 125, see also 3 id., at 137 (1644), Rex v. Fenwicke, 1 Keble 546, 83 Eng. Rep. 1104 (K. B. 1662) (recognizing the availability of retrial for misawarding of venue), Rex v. Talbot, Cro. Car. 311, 312, 79 Eng. Rep. 871, 872 (K. B. 1633) (awarding a new jury venire to remedy a vicinage error).",Alito,0,
2022-048,59,"Arundel's remedy remained unchanged throughout the 18th century. Because indictments are local, one prominent treatise explained, a prior acquittal on an indictment laid in an improper county would not bar  a subsequent indictment in the proper county. 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 526 (6th ed. 1788). Hale and Blackstone reached similar conclusions. See 2 M. Hale, History of the Pleas of the Crown 245 (1736) (concluding that a second prosecution was available for indictments in different counties because courts can only inquire touching a felony in their own county), 4 Blackstone 368-369 (explaining that a defendant may be indicted again when a judgment of conviction is arrested for failure to adequately identify the place of the crime in the indictment), see also, e.g., Rex v. Huggins, 2 Ld. Raym. 1574, 1585, 92 Eng. Rep. 518, 525 (K. B. 1730) (approvingly citing the remedy in Arundel's Case). In sum, no  common-law principle at the founding precluded retrial following a trial in an improper venue or before an improper jury.",Alito,0,
2022-048,60,"Early American practice provides further confirmation that violations of the Venue and Vicinage Clauses do not exempt defendants from retrial. Cf. Ramos, 590 U.

Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 49-50, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Perhaps most relevant here, this Court embraced the retrial rule for a venue error in United States v. Jackalow, 1 Black 484, 17 L.Ed. 225 (1862). In that case, the defendant had been convicted in New Jersey for a crime committed on a ship located off the coast of New York and Connecticut. Because the crime occurred outside of New Jersey, trial in that State was proper under the Venue and Vicinage Clauses only if the crime was committed outside the limits of any State. See supra, at 1602, n. 3. And because the jury's special verdict on the issue of venue did not establish that fact, the Court directed the lower court to set aside the special verdict, and grant a new trial. Jackalow, 1 Black at 488.",Alito,0,
2022-048,61,"This decision did not break new ground. Decades earlier, Justice Story had concluded that there are cases where there may be a new trial, as in cases of a mis-trial by an improper jury, United States v. Gibert, 25 F.Cas. 1287, 1302 (No. 15,204) (CC Mass. 1834) (citing Arundel's Case), and Justice Iredell had found it unnecessary to consider a vicinage objection because a new trial was warranted on other grounds, United States v. Fries, 3 Dall. 515, 518, 1 L.Ed. 701 (CC Pa. 1799). Other federal decisions ordered retrials for venue violations, see United States v. Plympton, 27 F. Cas. 578 (No. 16,057) (CC DC 1833), or otherwise accepted that a retrial would be sufficient to cure such an error, see, e.g., United States v. Keen, 26 F.Cas. 686, 690 (No. 15,510) (CC Ind. 1839) (It is laid down in all the authorities, that if the court have not jurisdiction  or the jury have not been legally summoned, the defendant, though tried, cannot be considered as having been in jeopardy). State courts had likewise begun reaching similar conclusions, notwithstanding the existence of venue and vicinage clauses in their State Constitutions.14 Given these developments, it is not surprising that American treatises from this period agreed with their English counterparts regarding the availability of retrial.15",Alito,0,
2022-048,62,"Far from justifying an exemption from the retrial rule, the historical background of the Venue and Vicinage Clauses supports the opposite inference. We have found—and Smith points to—no decision barring retrial based on a successful venue or vicinage objection in either the centuries of common law predating the founding or in the early years of practice following ratification. This absence alone is considerable evidence that the Clauses do not bar retrial of their own force. See, e.g., Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1960, 1969-70, 204 L.Ed.2d 322 (2019). Moreover, courts affirmatively allowed retrial following trials in an improper venue or before improperly constituted  juries. All told, we have no reason to doubt that the retrial rule applies.16",Alito,0,
2022-048,64,"Smith argues that even if the Venue and Vicinage Clauses do not bar retrial of their own force, they are inseparably interwoven with the Double Jeopardy Clause, which, he claims, precludes retrial here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, see Brief for Petitioner 38-39, 44. Smith starts from the premise that juries in criminal trials often resolve factual disputes related to venue and, thus, can acquit defendants if venue is absent. And because a jury's general verdict of acquittal categorically precludes retrial for the same offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause, Smith contends that a judicial ruling that venue was improper on a motion to acquit should have the same result. The Eleventh Circuit rejected this argument and held that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated by a retrial in a proper venue. 22 F.4th at 1244. We agree.",Alito,0,
2022-048,65,"A judicial decision on venue is fundamentally different from a jury's general verdict of acquittal. When a jury returns a general verdict of not guilty, its decision cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters by courts. Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393-394, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932), see United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 66-67, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984). To conclude otherwise would impermissibly authorize judges to usurp the jury right. See ibid., cf. United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 572-573, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). And because it is impossible for a court to be certain about the ground for the verdict without improperly delving into the jurors' deliberations, the jury holds an `unreviewable power  to return a verdict of not guilty' even `for impermissible reasons.' Powell, 469 U.S., at 63, 66-67, 105 S.Ct. 471, see Dunn, 284 U.S., at 393-394, 52 S.Ct. 189.",Alito,0,
2022-048,66,"This rationale is consistent with the general rule that culpability is the touchstone for determining whether retrial is permitted under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Evans v. Michigan, 568 U.S. 313, 324, 133 S.Ct. 1069, 185 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013). When a trial terminates with a finding that the defendant's criminal culpability had not been established, retrial is prohibited. Burks, 437 U.S., at 10, 98 S.Ct. 2141. This typically occurs with `a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.' Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U.S. 462, 468, 125 S.Ct. 1129, 160 L.Ed.2d 914 (2005), see, e.g., Martin Linen, 430 U.S., at 572, 97 S.Ct. 1349. But it also extends to essentially factual defenses that negate culpability by providing a legally adequate justification for otherwise criminal acts. United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 97-98, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), see Burks, 437 U.S., at 5, 10, 98 S.Ct. 2141 (insanity defense).",Alito,0,
2022-048,67,"Conversely, retrial is permissible when a trial terminates on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offence of which the defendant is accused. Scott, 437 U.S., at 99, 98 S.Ct. 2187. For example, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not triggered when a trial ends in juror deadlock, see Blueford v. Arkansas, 566 U.S. 599, 610, 132 S.Ct. 2044, 182 L.Ed.2d 937 (2012), or with a judgment  dismissing charges because of a procedural issue like preindictment delay, see Scott, 437 U.S., at 84, 98 S.Ct. 2187. In these circumstances, the termination of proceedings is perfectly consistent with the possibility that the defendant is guilty of the charged offense.",Alito,0,
2022-048,68,"The reversal of a conviction based on a violation of the Venue or Vicinage Clauses, even when styled as a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29, plainly does not resolve the bottom-line question of `criminal culpability.'

Instead, such a reversal is quintessentially a decision that the Government's case against the defendant must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Scott, 437 U.S., at 96, 98 S.Ct. 2187. In this case, then, the Eleventh Circuit's decision that venue in the Northern District of Florida was improper did not adjudicate Smith's culpability.

However, when prosecutors seek to introduce a nontestifying defendant's confession implicating his codefendants, a constitutional concern may arise. The Confrontation Clause of the  Sixth Amendment states that, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right  to be confronted with the witnesses against him. And, in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), this Court held that a defendant is deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause when his nontestifying codefendant's confession naming him as a participant in the crime is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession only against the codefendant.

Samia and Stillwell were each charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1958(a), murder-for-hire, in violation of § 1958(a), conspiracy to murder and kidnap in a foreign country, in violation of § 956(a)(1), causing death with a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of §§ 924(c)(1)(A) and (j), and conspiracy to launder money, in violation of § 1956(h). Hunter was charged with all but the money-laundering count. Thereafter, the Government tried all three men jointly in the Southern District of New York. While Hunter and Stillwell admitted that they had participated in the murder, Samia maintained his innocence.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,35,"Prior to trial, the Government moved in limine to admit Stillwell's confession. But, because Stillwell would not testify and the full confession inculpated Samia, the Government proposed that an agent testify as to the content of Stillwell's confession in a way that eliminated Samia's name while avoiding any obvious indications of redaction. The District Court granted the Government's motion but required further alterations to ensure consistency with its understanding of this Court's Confrontation  Clause precedents, including Bruton.1",Thomas,0,
2022-049,36,"At trial, the Government's theory of the case was that Hunter had hired Samia and Stillwell to pose as real-estate buyers and visit properties with Lee. The Government also sought to prove that Samia, Stillwell, and Lee were in a van that Stillwell was driving when Samia shot Lee. During its case in chief, in accordance with the court's ruling on its motion in limine, the Government presented testimony about Stillwell's confession through DEA Agent Eric Stouch. Stouch recounted the key portion of Stillwell's confession implicating Samia as follows:",Thomas,0,
2022-049,37,Q. Did Stillwell say where the victim was when she was killed?,Thomas,0,
2022-049,38,A. Yes. He described a time when the other person he was with pulled the trigger on that woman in a van that he and Mr. Stillwell was driving. App. 76 (emphasis added).,Thomas,0,
2022-049,39,"Other portions of Stouch's testimony also used the other person descriptor to refer to someone with whom Stillwell had traveled and lived and who carried a particular firearm. During Stouch's testimony, the District Court instructed the jury that his testimony was admissible only as to Stillwell and should not be considered as to Samia or Hunter. The District Court later provided a similar limiting instruction before the jury began its deliberations.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,40,"The jury convicted Samia and his codefendants on all counts, and the District Court subsequently denied Samia's post-trial motions. The District Court then sentenced Samia to life plus 10 years' imprisonment.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,41,"Samia appealed to the Second Circuit. On appeal, and as relevant here, he argued that the admission of Stillwell's confession —even as altered and with a limiting instruction—was constitutional error because other evidence and statements at trial enabled the jury to immediately infer that the other person described in the confession was Samia himself. He noted that, during opening statements, the Government had asserted that Stillwell drove the van while Samia was in the passenger seat, and that Samia pulled out a gun, turned around, aimed carefully and shot Lee. Id., at 52. He also pointed out that the Government had stated that Stillwell admitted to driving the car while the man he was with turned around and shot Lee. Id., at 58. So, even though Samia's position in the van and shooting of Lee were relevant to the Government's theory of the case with or without Stillwell's confession, Samia argued that those statements would allow the jury to infer that he was the other person in Stillwell's confession.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,42,"Samia made the same argument with respect to several pieces of trial evidence. For example, he pointed out that the Government had elicited testimony that Samia and Stillwell coordinated their travel to the Philippines and lived together there. Samia noted that there was testimony that he had the type of gun that was used to shoot Lee. And, he emphasized that, in its closing argument, the Government argued to the jury that video evidence showing Hunter speaking about hiring two men to murder Lee was admissible against all three defendants, allowing the jury to infer that Samia and Stillwell were co-conspirators. Id., at 199. Finally, Samia argued that, while discussing Stillwell's  confession, the prosecution had recounted how Stillwell described a time when the other person he was with in the Philippines pulled the trigger on that woman in a van that Stillwell was driving. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,43,"The Second Circuit rejected Samia's view, holding that the admission of Stillwell's confession did not violate Samia's Confrontation Clause rights. Applying Circuit precedent, it pointed to the established practice of replacing a defendant's name with a neutral noun or pronoun in a nontestifying codefendant's confession. The Second Circuit also noted that its inquiry considered the altered confession separate from the other evidence that had been introduced at trial.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,44,"We granted certiorari to determine whether the admission of Stillwell's altered confession, subject to a limiting instruction, violated Samia's rights under the Confrontation Clause. 598 U. S. ___, 143 S.Ct. 542, 214 L.Ed.2d 311 (2022).",Thomas,0,
2022-049,46,"The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to be confronted with the witnesses against him. As we have explained, this Clause forbids the introduction of out-of-court testimonial statements unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant has had the chance to cross-examine the witness previously. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Because Stillwell's formal, Mirandized confession to authorities, which the Government sought to introduce at trial, is testimonial, it falls within the Clause's ambit. See id., at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are  testimonial under even a narrow standard), Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 329, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (explaining that the Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements  contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nonetheless, the Confrontation Clause applies only to witnesses against the accused. Crawford, 541 U.S., at 50, 124 S.Ct. 1354. And, ordinarily, a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered to be a witness `against' a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against a codefendant. Richardson, 481 U.S., at 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702. This general rule is consistent with the text of the Clause, historical practice, and the law's reliance on limiting instructions in other contexts.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,48,"For most of our Nation's history, long-standing practice allowed a nontestifying codefendant's confession to be admitted in a joint trial so long as the jury was properly instructed not to consider it against the nonconfessing defendant. While some courts would omit the defendant's name or substitute a reference to another person (or the like), it is unclear whether any courts considered such alterations to be necessary as a categorical matter. In any event, the combination of such alterations and an appropriate limiting instruction was generally sufficient to permit the introduction of such confessions.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,49,"One early treatise explained that, when some part of a confession concerns other prisoners who are tried on the same indictment, all that can be done is to direct the jury not to take into their consideration such parts as affect the other prisoners. S. Phillipps, Law of Evidence 82 (1816). Another noted that, in English practice, where confessions were not admissible against third persons, the names of such  persons were by most judges ordered to be omitted, but by other judges the names were ordered read and the jury instructed not to use the confession against them. 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2100, p. 2841, and n. 5 (1904). In the United States, the latter practice was favored. Id., n. 5.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,50,"Considerable authority supports this approach. In Sparf v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 58, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895), the Court held that, because codefendant declarations were not, in any view of the case, competent evidence against another defendant, the trial court should have admitted them as evidence only against their respective declarants. Just one year later, in United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 672, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896), a case involving a joint murder trial of three defendants, the Court approved the use of a limiting instruction to restrict the jury's consideration of one defendant's incriminatory statements made after the killing had occurred. Citing Sparf, the Court emphasized that the trial judge had said, in the presence of the jury, that, of course, the one defendant's declarations would be only evidence against him. 163 U.S., at 672, 16 S.Ct. 1192. State practice was in accord, permitting the introduction of nontestifying codefendants' confessions subject only to a limiting instruction. See, e.g., State v. Workman, 15 S.C. 540, 545 (1881), Jones v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. 836, 839-840 (1878). And, though the Federal Confrontation Clause did not apply to these proceedings, state constitutions contained similar terms. See 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1397, pp. 155-158, n. 1 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974) (noting that virtually every state constitution during the relevant period contained a provision substantially equivalent to the Federal Confrontation Clause).",Thomas,0,
2022-049,51,"Notably, none of the early treatises or cases to which the parties have referred, or that we have discovered, suggests that a confession naming a codefendant must in all cases be edited to refer to another person (or something similar) such that the codefendant's name is not included in the confession. Accordingly, while it is unclear whether alteration of any kind was necessary, historical practice suggests at least that altering a nontestifying codefendant's confession not to name the defendant, coupled with a limiting instruction, was enough to permit the introduction of such confessions at least as an evidentiary matter.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,53,"This historical evidentiary practice is in accord with the law's broader assumption that jurors can be relied upon to follow the trial judge's instructions. Evidence at trial is often admitted for a limited purpose, accompanied by a limiting instruction. And, our legal system presumes that jurors will `attend closely the particular language of such instructions in a criminal case and strive to understand, make sense of, and follow' them. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 740, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).",Thomas,0,
2022-049,54,"The Court has presumed, for example, that jurors will follow instructions to consider a defendant's prior conviction only for purposes of a sentence enhancement and not in determining whether he committed the criminal acts charged. Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 438, and n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983). This presumption works in tandem with a defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to testify against himself, by ensuring that jurors do not draw an adverse inference from his choice not to testify. Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U.S. 333, 338-341, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 55 L.Ed.2d 319 (1978). It also applies to situations with potentially life-and-death stakes for defendants: A limiting instruction  may be used to instruct jurors to consider mitigating evidence for purposes of one defendant and not another at the sentencing stage of a joint capital trial. Kansas v. Carr, 577 U.S. 108, 124-125, 136 S.Ct. 633, 193 L.Ed.2d 535 (2016).",Thomas,0,
2022-049,55,"Of particular relevance here, the presumption that jurors follow limiting instructions applies to statements that are often substantially more credible and inculpatory than a codefendant's confession. For example, this Court has held that statements elicited from a defendant in violation of Miranda can be used to impeach the defendant's credibility, provided the jury is properly instructed not to consider them as evidence of guilt. Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 223-225, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971). Such statements, elicited from the defendant himself, are often some of the most compelling evidence of guilt available to a jury. By contrast, jurors may cast a critical eye on accomplice testimony—and, in particular, self-serving accomplice testimony like Stillwell's that accuses another of the most culpable conduct.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,56,"The presumption credits jurors by refusing to assume that they are either too ignorant to comprehend, or were too unmindful of their duty to respect, instructions of the court. Pennsylvania Co. v. Roy, 102 U.S. 451, 459, 26 L.Ed. 141 (1880). Moreover, to disregard or to make unnecessary exceptions to it would make inroads into the entire complex code of criminal evidentiary law, and would threaten other large areas of trial jurisprudence. Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 562, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967). As explained below, we have no reason to do so here.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,58,"In Bruton v. United States, this Court recognized a narrow exception to the presumption that juries follow their instructions, holding that a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when the facially incriminating confession of a nontestifying codefendant is introduced at their joint trial, even with a proper instruction. Richardson, 481 U.S., at 207, 107 S.Ct. 1702. In Richardson v. Marsh, the Court declined to extend Bruton further to confessions that do not name the defendant. Id., at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 194, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998), later qualified Richardson by holding that certain obviously redacted confessions might be directly accusatory, and thus fall within Bruton's rule, even if they did not specifically use a defendant's name.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,59,"Thus, the Court's precedents distinguish between confessions that directly implicate a defendant and those that do so indirectly. Under these precedents, and consistent with the longstanding historical practice discussed above, the introduction here of Stillwell's altered confession coupled with a limiting instruction did not violate the Confrontation Clause.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,62,"In Bruton, the Court considered the joint trial of George Bruton and William Evans for armed postal robbery. 391 U.S., at 124, 88 S.Ct. 1620. During two pretrial interrogations, Evans confessed to a postal inspector that he and Bruton—whom he implicated by name—had committed the robbery. Ibid. The confession was introduced at trial, coupled with a limiting instruction that it not be used against Bruton. Id., at 124-125, and n. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1620. This Court held that, because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining  Bruton's guilt, admission of Evans' confession in this joint trial violated Bruton's right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,63,"The Court acknowledged that a defendant is `entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one' and conceded that it is not unreasonable to conclude that in many  cases the jury can and will follow the trial judge's instructions to disregard certain information. Id., at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620 (quoting Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 619, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953)). It even acknowledged that, if it were true that the jury disregarded the reference to Bruton, no question would arise under the Confrontation Clause. 391 U.S., at 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620. Yet, the Court reasoned that there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Id., at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620. Accordingly, in the Court's view, the introduction of Evans' confession posed a substantial threat to Bruton's right to confront the witnesses against him. Id., at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,65,"Later, in Richardson, the Court declined to expand the Bruton rule to a redacted confession that inculpated the defendant only when viewed in conjunction with other evidence. There, Clarissa Marsh, Benjamin Williams, and Kareem Martin were each charged with assault and murder. 481 U.S., at 202, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Marsh and Williams were tried jointly for the crime. Ibid. And, at trial, the State introduced Williams' confession, taken by police shortly after his arrest. Id., at 203, 107 S.Ct. 1702. As introduced, however, the confession was redacted to omit all reference to Marsh—indeed, to omit all indication that anyone other than Martin and Williams participated in the crime. Ibid. The confession largely corroborated the victim's testimony and additionally described a conversation between Williams and Martin as they drove to the scene of the crime: According to Williams, Martin said that he would have to kill the victims after the robbery. Id., at 204, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Following the confession's admission, the trial judge instructed the jury not to use it against Marsh in any way, an instruction reiterated in the jury charge at the conclusion of trial. Id., at 204-205, 107 S.Ct. 1702. In her testimony, however, Marsh volunteered that, during the drive to the crime scene, she `knew that Martin and Williams were talking' but could not hear the conversation because `the radio was on and the speaker was right in her ear.' Id., at 204, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (alternations in original). Both Marsh and Williams were convicted. Id., at 205, 107 S.Ct. 1702.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,66,"In considering the introduction of Williams' confession, this Court noted that, ordinarily, a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered to be a witness `against' a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against a codefendant, emphasizing the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions. Id., at 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702. It then explained that Bruton represented a narrow exception to this principle. 481 U.S., at 207, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Whereas the confession in Bruton had `expressly implicated' the defendant and his accomplice, the confession in Richardson was not incriminating on its face, and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial. 481 U.S., at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (citing Bruton, 391 U.S., at 124, n. 1, 88  S.Ct. 1620). The former evidence, the Court explained, is more vivid and thus more difficult to thrust out of mind. 481 U.S., at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Additionally, in the case of inferential incrimination, the Court posited that the judge's instruction may well be successful in dissuading the jury from entering onto the path of inference, leaving no incrimination to forget. Ibid.2",Thomas,0,
2022-049,68,"Gray then confronted a question Richardson expressly left open: whether a confession altered by substituting for the defendant's name in the confession a blank space or the word `deleted' violated the Confrontation Clause. 523 U.S., at 188, 118 S.Ct. 1151, see also Richardson, 481 U.S., at 211, n. 5, 107 S.Ct. 1702. In Gray, the Court considered Anthony Bell's confession to Baltimore police, implicating himself, Kevin Gray, and co-conspirator Jacquin Vanlandingham in a murder. 523 U.S., at 188, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The prosecution sought to introduce the confession at trial, and the trial judge required that it be redacted to use the word deleted or deletion whenever Gray's or Vanlandingham's names appeared. Ibid. At trial, the prosecution had a police detective read the confession aloud to the jury verbatim, substituting the words deleted or deletion for Gray's or Vanlandingham's names.3 Ibid. Immediately after the detective finished reading the confession, the prosecutor asked, `after he gave you that information, you subsequently were able to arrest Mr. Kevin Gray, is that correct?' The officer responded, `That's correct.' Id., at 188-189, 118 S.Ct. 1151. In instructing the jury at the close of trial, the judge specified that Bell's confession was evidence only against Bell, admonishing the jury not to use the confession as evidence against Gray. Id., at 189, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The jury convicted Bell and Gray.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,69,"This Court held that the confession was inadmissible under Bruton. It first noted that, unlike Richardson's redacted confession, Bell's confession referred directly to the `existence' of the nonconfessing defendant. 523 U.S., at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The Court then concluded that, when a redacted confession simply replaces a name with an obvious blank space or a word such as `deleted' or a symbol or other similarly obvious indications of alteration, the evidence so closely resembles Bruton's unredacted statements that  the law must require the same result. Ibid. The Court reasoned that such obvious blanks would cause the jurors to speculate as to whom the omitted individual may be, lifting their eyes to the nonconfessing defendant, sitting at counsel table, to find what will seem the obvious answer, as the judge's instruction will provide an obvious reason for the blank. Id., at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1151. It also reasoned that statements redacted to leave a blank or some other similarly obvious alteration were directly accusatory, pointing directly to the defendant  in a manner similar to Evans' use of Bruton's name or to a testifying codefendant's accusatory finger. Id., at 194, 118 S.Ct. 1151.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,70,"While the Court conceded that Richardson placed outside the scope of Bruton's rule those statements that incriminate inferentially, it explained that inference pure and simple cannot make the critical difference, for if it did, then Richardson would also place outside Bruton's scope confessions that use shortened first names, nicknames, and descriptions as unique as the `red-haired, bearded, one-eyed man-with-a-limp.' Id., at 195, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The Court elaborated:",Thomas,0,
2022-049,71,"That being so, Richardson must depend in significant part upon the kind of, not the simple fact of, inference. Richardson's inferences involved statements that did not refer directly to the defendant himself and which became incriminating `only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.' 481 U.S., at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702. The inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant, and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial. Id., at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,72,"Finally, the Court stressed that its holding, which addressed only obviously redacted confessions, was sufficiently narrow to avoid unnecessarily leading prosecutors to abandon the relevant confession or joint trial. Id., at 197, 118 S.Ct. 1151.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,74,"Viewed together, the Court's precedents distinguish between confessions that directly implicate a defendant and those that do so indirectly. Richardson explicitly declined to extend Bruton's narrow exception to the presumption that jurors follow their instructions beyond those confessions that occupy the former category. 481 U.S., at 207, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Gray qualified but confirmed this legal standard, reiterating that the Bruton rule applies only to directly accusatory incriminating statements, as distinct from those that do not refer directly to the defendant and become incriminating only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial. 523 U.S., at 194, 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, neither Bruton, Richardson, nor Gray provides license to flyspeck trial transcripts in search of evidence that could give rise to a collateral inference that the defendant had been named in an altered confession.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,75,"Here, the District Court's admission of Stillwell's confession, accompanied by a limiting instruction, did not run afoul of this Court's precedents. Stillwell's confession was redacted to avoid naming Samia, satisfying Bruton's rule. And, it was not obviously redacted in a manner resembling the confession in Gray, the neutral references to some other person were not akin to an obvious blank or the word deleted. In fact, the redacted confession is strikingly similar to a hypothetical modified confession we looked upon favorably in Gray, where we posited that, instead of saying `me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys,' the witness could easily have said `me and a few other guys.' 523 U.S., at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151. Accordingly, it falls outside the narrow exception Bruton created. Richardson, 481 U.S., at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,76,"Moreover, it would not have been feasible to further modify Stillwell's confession to make it appear, as in Richardson, that he had acted alone. Stillwell was charged with conspiracy and did not confess to shooting Lee. Consequently, the evidence of coordination between Stillwell and Lee's killer (whether Samia or not) was necessary to prove an essential element of the  Government's case. In addition, editing the statement to exclude mention of the other person may have made it seem as though Stillwell and Lee were alone in the van at the time Lee was shot. Such a scenario may have led the jurors—who sat in judgment of both Samia and Stillwell—to conclude that Stillwell was the shooter, an obviously prejudicial result.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,78,"As described above, expanding the Bruton rule in the way Samia proposes would be inconsistent with longstanding practice and our precedents. It would also work an unnecessary and imprudent change in law, resulting in precisely the practical effects that the Court rejected in Richardson. The Confrontation Clause rule that Samia proposes would require federal and state trial courts to conduct extensive pretrial hearings to determine whether the jury could infer from the Government's case in its entirety that the defendant had been named in an altered confession. See Brief for Petitioner 16. That approach would be burdensome and far from foolproof, 481 U.S., at 209, 107 S.Ct. 1702, and we decline to endorse it.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,79,"Indeed, it would be impractical to fully police juror inferences in the way Samia seems to suggest, in a criminal trial, all evidence that supports the prosecution's theory of the case is, to some extent, mutually reinforcing. Thus, the likely practical consequence of Samia's position would be to mandate severance whenever the prosecution wishes to introduce the confession of a nontestifying codefendant in a joint trial. But, as this Court has observed, that is too high a price to pay. Id., at 210, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Joint trials have long played a vital role in the criminal justice system, preserving government resources and allowing victims to avoid repeatedly reliving trauma. Id., at 209, 107 S.Ct. 1702, see also United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat. 480, 482-483, 485, 6 L.Ed. 700 (1827) (STORY, J.) (recognizing the crucial role of joint trials). Further, joint trials encourage consistent verdicts and enable more accurate assessments of relative culpability. See Bruton, 391 U.S., at 143, 88 S.Ct. 1620 (WHITE, J., dissenting) (Separate trials are apt to have varying consequences for legally indistinguishable defendants). Also, separate trials randomly favor the last-tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution's case beforehand. Richardson, 481 U.S., at 210, 107 S.Ct. 1702.",Thomas,0,
2022-049,80,"Samia offers, as an alternative, that the Government may choose to forgo use of the confession entirely, thereby avoiding the need for severance. But, this ignores the fact that confessions are `essential to society's compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.' Ibid. And, as described above, Samia's proposal is not compelled by the Confrontation Clause.* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-049,81,"The Confrontation Clause ensures that defendants have the opportunity to confront witnesses against them, but it does not provide a freestanding guarantee against the risk of potential prejudice that may arise inferentially in a joint trial. Here, the Clause was not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession that did not directly inculpate the defendant and was subject to a proper limiting instruction.",Thomas,0,

2022-049,85,"I agree that the admission of Stillwell's modified confession, together with a limiting  instruction, did not violate the Confrontation Clause. But in my view, the historical evidence described in Part II-A, ante, is beside the point.",Barrett,0,
2022-049,86,"First is a timing problem. The evidence is largely from the late 19th and early 20th centuries—far too late to inform the meaning of the Confrontation Clause at the time of the founding. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Court seems to agree, because it does not suggest that the history is probative of original meaning. But nor does it explain why this seemingly random time period matters. For whatever reason (the parties only speculate), there appears to be little founding-era evidence illustrating how courts handled the admission of a codefendant's confession. So why not simply say that the history is inconclusive? And if we are going to pick up the thread in 1878, why drop it in 1896? Ante, at 2012-2013. Are cases from 1896 that much more important than cases from, say, the 1940s? While the Court makes a claim about longstanding practice for most of our Nation's history, ante, at 2012, it describes only a snapshot.",Barrett,0,
2022-049,87,"That brings me to my second problem: the substance of the snapshot. The cited cases address the rules of evidence rather than the Confrontation Clause. Ante, at 2012-2014. On top of that, the two federal cases do not discuss the effectiveness of limiting instructions, much less any need for redaction. Sparf v. United States holds that the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule does not apply to statements made after the conspiracy has ended. 156 U.S. 51, 56, 15 S.Ct. 273, 39 L.Ed. 343 (1895). Emphasizing the trial court's error in admitting the statements against both defendants, the Court explained that the trial court should have admitted them against the speaker and excluded them against his codefendant. Id., at 58, 15 S.Ct. 273. Neither limiting instructions nor redaction came up. United States v. Ball is similarly tangential to Samia's case. 163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). There, the Court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in trying three codefendants together. Id., at 672, 16 S.Ct. 1192. As support for that point, the Court noted that when the Government introduced the admissions of one defendant, the trial court at once said, in the presence of the jury, that, of course, it would be only evidence against him, if he said anything, and the court was not afterwards requested to make any further ruling upon this point. Ibid. The Court assumed in passing that the limiting instruction was effective—but the codefendants did not argue otherwise, and they did not ask the court to alter the statements.",Barrett,0,
2022-049,88,"The two state cases at least address (and endorse) the use of a limiting instruction after the admission of a codefendant's confession. State v. Workman 15 S.C. 540, 545 (1881), Jones v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. 836, 839-840 (1878). One even holds that a trial court should not alter a statement by redacting a codefendant's name. Workman, 15 S.C. at 545. Like the federal cases, though, the state cases make no mention of the confrontation right. Same for the treatises cited by the Court. See S. Phillipps, Law of Evidence *82-*83 (1816), 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2100, p. 2841, and n. 5 (1904). So for all we know, the cases cited by the Court and the treatises proceed from the premise that an ordinary hearsay rule, as opposed to a constitutional right, was on the line. That weakens the importance of these sources, because courts might have gone to greater lengths (for example, redaction) to ensure that a jury did not consider a declaration whose admission would violate the State or Federal Constitution. Bruton v. United States, after all, grounds itself in the Sixth  Amendment. 391 U.S. 123, 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).",Barrett,0,
2022-049,89,"At best, the evidence recounted in Part II-A shows that, during a narrow historical period, some courts assumed and others expressly held that a limiting instruction sufficiently protected a codefendant from a declaration inadmissible on hearsay grounds. In suggesting anything more, the Court overclaims. That is unfortunate. While history is often important and sometimes dispositive, we should be discriminating in its use. Otherwise, we risk undermining the force of historical arguments when they matter most.",Barrett,0,
2022-049,90,"Justice KAGAN, with whom Justice SOTOMAYOR and Justice JACKSON join, dissenting.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,91,"Imagine a criminal case involving two defendants—John and Mary. John and Mary are arrested for robbing Bill. Before trial, John confesses to the robbery in an interview with police. But John does more than admit his own involvement, he also points a finger at Mary. John says to the police: Mary and I went out Saturday night and robbed Bill. Mary, on the other hand, never confesses to the robbery. She maintains that she wasn't involved—in fact, that she never left her home on the night in question. The government tries John and Mary together. At trial, it introduces a copy of John's confession into evidence, and has it read to the jury by the interviewing officer. But John elects not to take the stand, leaving Mary's attorney without an opportunity to cross-examine him about his confession.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,92,"This Court's precedent bars the government from using John's confession in that way. The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against her, which includes the right to cross-examine those witnesses. See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). So when two defendants are tried jointly, the pretrial confession of one identifying the other as involved in the crime cannot be admitted unless the confessing defendant takes the stand. That is true, we held in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), regardless of whether a judge instructs the jury to consider the evidence only against the confessor (John), and not against his co-defendant (Mary). Even with that kind of instruction, a substantial risk exists that the jury will impermissibly rely on John's confession when determining Mary's guilt. Id., at 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,93,"Suppose, though, that the government redacts the confession to eliminate Mary's name. Mary still sits in the courtroom alongside John. But the version of the confession admitted into evidence now includes a blank space where Mary's name belongs. And when the interviewing officer reads the confession to the jury, he says deleted in place of Mary's name. So instead of Mary and I went out Saturday night and robbed Bill, what the jury hears is deleted and I went out Saturday night and robbed Bill.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,94,"That confession, too, is inadmissible under our precedent. Though the confession no longer identifies Mary by name, the implication is obvious: A juror need only lift his eyes to Mary, sitting at counsel table, to realize to whom deleted refers. Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 193, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998). The redacted confession thus presents the same risk as the unredacted one—that the jury will consider it as evidence against Mary even if instructed not to. Because the confessions so closely resemble each other, we have held, the law must require the same result. Id., at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,95,"Now consider one last option. The government again modifies the confession to avoid the express reference. But this time, instead of swapping Mary's name out for deleted, the government replaces it with the words a woman. The line read to the jury thus becomes: A woman and I went out Saturday night and robbed Bill. In the face of precedent that would bar the government from using either of the first two versions of John's confession, a judge must decide what to do about this one. Would its admission, too, violate Mary's right of confrontation?",Kagan,0,
2022-049,96,"The answer should be obvious. A jury is still going to recognize that John is talking about Mary—for who else could the mystery woman be? This last version of the confession thus presents the same risk as the first two: that jurors will rely on John's confession when assessing Mary's guilt. Yet in today's decision, the Court draws a line of constitutional significance between the first two examples and the third. Confessions that use a defendant's name or a symbol of omission—clear Confrontation Clause violation. Confessions that replace a defendant's name with another placeholder—no Sixth Amendment problem, no matter how obvious the reference to the defendant. In so elevating form over substance, the majority permits an end-run around our precedent and undermines a vital constitutional protection for the accused.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,98,"Start with Bruton, the foundation of this Court's precedent on the introduction of confessions at joint trials. The government, we held in that case, cannot introduce a confession by a non-testifying defendant that names a co-defendant as an accomplice. Admitting the confession against the co-defendant would violate her Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine witnesses. See 391 U.S., at 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620. And an instruction to the jury to disregard the confession when assessing the co-defendant's guilt cannot remove the constitutional problem. That is because of the effect that such a powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statement is likely to have on a jury. Id., at 135-136, 88 S.Ct. 1620. In this context, the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow the instruction is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Id., at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,99,"The Bruton rule applies even when an accusatory confession does not expressly name the co-defendant. Bruton, we have held, bars the use of confessions that replace a name with an obvious blank space or symbol or word such as `deleted.' Gray, 523 U.S., at 189, 118 S.Ct. 1151. (So the Bruton rule extends beyond the first John-and-Mary hypothetical to the second.) And similarly, Bruton bars the admission of confessions that use shortened first names, nicknames, and descriptions as unique as the `red-haired, bearded, one-eyed man-with-a-limp.' Gray, 523 U.S., at 195, 118 S.Ct. 1151, accord, ante, at 2017. The Court assumed, for example, that at a joint trial of four defendants—three Black, one white—Bruton required the exclusion of two of the Black defendants' confessions because they referred to the white guy as a participant in the crime. Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 252-253, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), see Gray, 523 U.S., at 195, 118 S.Ct. 1151. Though confessions of that kind do not expressly name a non-confessing defendant, they still point directly at him. See id., at 194, 118 S.Ct. 1151. They thus raise the same constitutional concern—that jurors will consider the confession's accusation in evaluating the non-confessing defendant's guilt.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,100,"Until today, Bruton's application turned on the effect a confession is likely to have on the jury, as a comparison of two of our decisions shows. In Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), we approved the admission of a confession redacted to eliminate not only a co-defendant's name, but any reference to his or her existence. Despite that complete redaction, the confession served to incriminate the co-defendant later in the trial, when her own testimony placed her in a car ride that the confession described. See id., at 206, 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702. But we thought that a confession that incriminated only by connection with subsequent evidence was neither so vivid nor so powerful as a confession that incriminated on its face. Id., at 208-209, 107 S.Ct. 1702. For that reason, we thought, the jury was more likely to obey the instruction to disregard the confession as to the co-defendant. Id., at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702. But we held in Gray that the calculus is different when a confession refers directly to the `existence' of the nonconfessing defendant, even though not by name. 523 U.S., at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151. Such a confession itself points a finger at a co-defendant, so that the jury can immediately and vividly grasp how it implicates her. Id., at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The impact is so similar to naming the defendant that the law must require the same result. Id., at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151. In both situations, the confession's powerfully incriminating effect creates a special, and vital, need for cross-examination—just as if the codefendant pointed directly to the defendant in the courtroom. Id., at 194, 118 S.Ct. 1151.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,101,"Consider against that backdrop the facts of this case. Petitioner Adam Samia was tried jointly with two co-defendants—Joseph Hunter and Carl David Stillwell—on charges related to a murder committed in the Philippines. According to the prosecution's theory of the case, Paul LeRoux, the head of a transnational criminal organization, ordered the killing, and Hunter, one of LeRoux's managers, hired Samia and Stillwell as hitmen. Before trial, Stillwell confessed to federal agents that both he and Samia were present at the murder, but told them that Samia was the triggerman. On that version of events, Samia shot the victim in a van that Stillwell was driving. App. 42-43, 45. At trial, one of the agents testified about Stillwell's confession, replacing Samia's name with placeholders like somebody else and the other person. Id., at 75. So, for example, when the prosecutor asked the agent what Stillwell had said about his arrival in the Philippines, the agent answered: He stated that he had met somebody else over there. Ibid. And when asked whether Stillwell had recounted the crime, the agent testified: Yes. He described a time when the other person he was with pulled the trigger on that woman in a van that he and Mr. Stillwell was driving. Id., at 76.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,102,"From the jury's perspective, the identity of the triggerman would have been obvious. The jury knew from the start of trial that there were just three defendants. It knew based on the prosecutor's opening statement that those defendants were on trial for offenses related to a death in the Philippines. And it knew the role that each defendant allegedly played in the crime: Hunter had hired Stillwell and Samia as hitmen, and those two men carried out the murder. In fact, the prosecutor began his opening statement with the exact sequence of events Stillwell had described in his interview: The prosecutor told jurors that Samia shot the victim twice in the face while the victim was riding in the backseat of a van driven by Stillwell. Id., at 52. So when the federal agent took the stand on day two of the trial, it didn't make a  lick of difference that he didn't identify the shooter by name, but instead used placeholder terms. Any reasonable juror would have realized immediately—and without reference to any other evidence—that the other person who pulled the trigger was Samia.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,103,"That fact makes Stillwell's confession inadmissible under our Bruton precedent. The agent's testimony about the confession pointed a finger straight at Samia, no less than if the agent had used Samia's name or called him deleted.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,105,"So how does the majority reach a contrary result? The nomenclature it adopts isn't the problem: In describing Bruton's scope, the majority distinguishes between confessions that directly implicate a defendant and those that do so indirectly. Ante, at 2014, 2017. That distinction roughly tracks the one this Court has recognized between confessions that themselves incriminate a co-defendant (directly implicate) and those that become incriminating only when linked with later-introduced evidence (indirectly implicate). See supra, at 2021-2022. But the majority distorts that distinction beyond recognition when applying it to the facts of this case. In one blink-and-you-miss-it paragraph of analysis, the majority holds that Stillwell's confession does not directly implicate Samia for two reasons. It was redacted to avoid naming Samia. Ante, at 2017. And the redaction was not akin to an obvious blank or the word `deleted.' Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,106,"That analysis altogether fails to capture what our Bruton cases care about. This Court has already made clear that the first fact relied on—that Stillwell's confession did not use Samia's name—is not dispositive. See supra, at 2021-2022. A confession redacted with a blank space, after all, also avoids naming the defendant, yet Gray held that it falls within Bruton's scope. So today's decision must rest on the second feature of the confession: that the placeholder used (e.g., the other person) was neither a blank space nor the word deleted. But that distinction makes nonsense of the Bruton rule. Bruton's application has always turned on a confession's inculpatory impact. See, e.g., Cruz v. New York, 481 U.S. 186, 193, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987) (considering the likelihood that a limiting instruction will be disregarded and the probability that such disregard will have a devastating effect). And as the John-and-Mary examples make clear, a confession that swaps in a phrase like the other person for a defendant's name may incriminate just as powerfully as one that swaps in a blank space. See supra, at 2020-2021. So the majority warps our Bruton precedent by categorically putting the two on opposite sides of the constitutional line. As the Court remarked in another case about Bruton, the law cannot command respect if we apply such inexplicable—and indeed unprincipled—line-drawing to a constitutional imperative. Cruz, 481 U.S., at 193, 107 S.Ct. 1714.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,107,"Contrary to the majority's claim, Gray repudiates rather than supports the distinction adopted today. In holding that Bruton's protections extend beyond confessions with names to confessions with blanks, Gray explained that what should matter is not a confession's form but its effects. A jury, Gray noted, will often react similarly to the two kinds of confessions, the blank space (rather than name) is not likely to fool anyone. 523 U.S., at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1151. Ignoring Gray's forest for one tree, the majority points to a passage in which the Court described how a confession in the case could have been further redacted: Instead of saying me, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys,  the witness could have said me and a few other guys. Id., at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151. But on Gray's particular facts, the latter version was unproblematic. The crime was a gang assault involving six perpetrators, while only one other person was on trial with the confessing defendant. The me and a few other guys phrase thus did not point a finger directly at the co-defendant, as the other person phrase here did at Samia. The more relevant reference discussed in Gray was to the white guy in a trial with only one white defendant, as described above. Id., at 195, 118 S.Ct. 1151, see supra, at 2021-2022. Gray left no doubt that the confession with that phrase should have been excluded—and for the same reason as the confession with deleted. When a modified confession has an accusatory effect similar to one with names, the Court reasoned, the law requires the same result. Id., at 192, 194, 118 S.Ct. 1151. Gray could not have cared less whether the modification takes the form of a blank space or of a different, but no less accusatory, placeholder.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,108,"The practical concerns the majority cites in support of its decision are equally flimsy. On the majority's view, a ruling for Samia would require courts to conduct extensive pretrial hearings reviewing the Government's case in its entirety. Ante, at 2018. But that charge is a strawman—and one that Gray already knocked down. See 523 U.S., at 197, 118 S.Ct. 1151. The Bruton rule—whether applying to confessions with names, with blanks, or with other placeholders—demands only that a court consider in advance of trial such matters as the content of the confession, the number of defendants, and the prosecution's general theory of the case. Cruz, 481 U.S., at 193, 107 S.Ct. 1714, see Gray, 523 U.S., at 197, 118 S.Ct. 1151, cf. Richardson, 481 U.S., at 209, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (noting that a more demanding inquiry would be needed if Bruton applied to confessions incriminating only by connection with later-introduced evidence). Courts have long considered those basic factors when applying Bruton.1 And the Government has proved unable to cite a single case—including in Circuits applying Brutonto confessions like Stillwell's—in which doing so created administrability issues, much less fewer joint trials. Tr. of Oral Arg. 93-96.2 In any event, greater convenience in the administration of the law, as Bruton noted, cannot come at the expense of fundamental principles of constitutional liberty. 391 U.S., at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620. That price, we recognized then, is too high. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,109,"With nothing else to support it, the majority reaches for two props inconsistent with Bruton itself. One is the presumption that jurors follow limiting instructions. Ante, at 2014. The majority correctly describes that presumption, it just forgets that the presumption does not apply when the evidence at issue is an accusatory co-defendant confession. Bruton could not have been clearer on the point: We cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for a defendant's constitutional right of cross-examination. 391 U.S., at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620, see Gray, 523 U.S., at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151 (stating that co-defendant confessions are  so prejudicial that limiting instructions cannot work), Richardson, 481 U.S., at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (noting the overwhelming probability of jurors' inability to follow instructions to disregard co-defendant confessions), see supra, at 2021. And the majority does no better in invoking historical evidentiary practice. See ante, at 2012-2014. One point here is Justice BARRETT's: There just isn't much history helping the majority. See ante, at 2018-2020 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But assume for a moment to the contrary: Suppose with the majority that at some relevant time, courts conducting joint trials admitted unredacted co-defendant confessions subject only to limiting instructions. Ante, at 2012-2014. If that history controlled, Bruton itself would have been wrongly decided. The majority's real views thus come into focus. The point of its opinion is not to distinguish the confession here from the one in Bruton. The point is to say why Bruton should go.* * *",Kagan,0,
2022-049,110,"And so one might wonder after reading today's decision whether Bruton is the next precedent on this Court's chopping block. The one reason it may not be is that there is now no need for formal overruling: Under this decision, prosecutors can always circumvent Bruton's protections. Consider once more John's confession implicating Mary in a robbery—a confession, I'll now add, bearing a striking resemblance to the one in Bruton. See 391 U.S., at 124, 88 S.Ct. 1620 (A postal inspector testified that Evans orally confessed to him that Evans and Bruton committed the armed robbery). The Bruton rule will still bar the prosecution from using the original version of John's confession, expressly naming Mary. So too the rule will prevent the prosecution from swapping out Mary's name for a blank space or the word deleted. But no worries—the government now has a functionally equivalent placeholder at its (Court-sanctioned) disposal. It can simply replace Mary's name with a woman, and the Bruton issue will go away. But contrary to today's decision, the serious Sixth Amendment problem remains. Now, defendants in joint trials will not have the chance to confront some of the most damaging witnesses against them. And a constitutional right once guaranteeing that opportunity will no longer. It will become, in joint trials, a shell of its former self. I respectfully dissent.",Kagan,0,
2022-049,111,"Justice JACKSON, dissenting.",Jackson,0,
2022-049,112,"I join Justice KAGAN's dissent in full, and agree, in particular, with her insight that the majority's bottom-line view is that Bruton should go. Ante, at 2025. I am writing to emphasize that most of the force of the Court's argument (to the extent that it is at all forceful) comes from the majority having improperly reframed the constitutional standard that applies to the admission of incriminating testimonial statements of a codefendant during a joint criminal trial.",Jackson,0,
2022-049,113,"Under the majority's approach, the default rule is that a nontestifying codefendant's incriminating confession is admissible, so long as it is accompanied by a limiting instruction. Ante, at 2012, 2014, 2018. Thus, for present purposes, the majority repeatedly calls Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), a `narrow exception' to this default rule. Ante, at 2014, 2015-2016, 2017-2018. And the thrust of the majority's holding is that the so-called Bruton exception is—and must be—narrow: Bruton is a pesky deviation that requires the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence (hence, the ease with which the majority contemplates dispensing with that precedent).",Jackson,0,
2022-049,114,"That approach inverts the constitutional principles that govern this case. Under our well-established Sixth Amendment precedents, the Court's analysis must, instead, start from the premise that the introduction of Stillwell's inculpatory confession during the joint trial threatened Samia's Confrontation Clause rights. The introduction of a testimonial statement from an unavailable declarant violates the Confrontation Clause unless the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 59, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). And, here, there is no dispute that Stillwell's statement to law enforcement was testimonial, that Stillwell was an unavailable declarant, and that Samia had no opportunity to cross-examine Stillwell. Therefore, the default presumption in this case should have been that Stillwell's confession was notadmissible at his and Samia's joint trial, because the statement implicated Samia on its face, and Samia could not cross-examine the declarant.*",Jackson,0,
2022-049,115,"When the Government attempted to nonetheless introduce Stillwell's inculpatory confession notwithstanding Samia's inability to cross-examine him, it sought an exception from the Confrontation Clause's exclusion mandate. Before today, this Court had never held that a limiting instruction, combined with a redaction that merely replaces the defendant's name, sufficiently cures the constitutional problem. In Bruton, the Court rejected the idea of an exception entirely—it entertained permitting such an exception in light of a limiting instruction given at trial, but the Court ultimately declined to adopt one. 391 U.S., at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620 (In the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner's constitutional right of cross-examination). Then, in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998), the Government tried again to get an exception to the Confrontation Clause—this time adding an obvious redaction of the defendant's name in the confession on top of the limiting instruction—but this Court once again rebuffed such efforts. Id., at 188, 118 S.Ct. 1151. Indeed, the only prior case in which this Court has permitted an exception to the baseline confrontation rule of exclusion was one in which the confession at issue arguably was not even against the defendant in the first place, as it did not incriminate the accused in any way until the defendant herself introduced evidence that rendered the confession inculpatory. Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206, 208, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987).",Jackson,0,

2022-050,41,The question presented is whether the exception to the notice requirement in § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) applies only where a delinquent taxpayer has a legal interest in accounts or records summoned by the IRS under § 7602(a). A straightforward reading  of the statutory text supplies a ready answer: The notice exception does not contain such a limitation.,Roberts,0,
2022-050,43,"The statute sets forth three conditions to exempt the IRS from providing notice in circumstances like these. First, a summons must be issued in aid of  collection. § 7609(c)(2)(D). Second, it must aid the collection of an assessment made or judgment rendered. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). By assessment, the Code refers to the official recording of a taxpayer's liability. Direct Marketing Assn. v. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 9, 135 S.Ct. 1124, 191 L.Ed.2d 97 (2015), see also Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 100, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). Section 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) does not excuse notice, therefore, until the IRS makes an official assessment or a judgment has been rendered with respect to a taxpayer's liability. Third, a summons must aid the collection of assessments or judgments against the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). This requirement links the subject of the assessment or judgment with the subject of the collection effort—they must concern the same delinquent taxpayer. None of the three components for excusing notice in § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) mentions a taxpayer's legal interest in records sought by the IRS, much less requires that a taxpayer maintain such an interest for the exception to apply.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,44,"Had Congress wanted to include a legal interest requirement, it certainly knew how to do so. The very next provision—also enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1976—requires the IRS to establish the rates and conditions for reimbursing costs incurred in searching for, reproducing, or transporting information sought by a summons. § 7610(a)(2), see 90 Stat. 1702. But the IRS may not provide reimbursement if the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued has a proprietary interest in the records to be produced. § 7610(b)(1). We assume that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act. Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. 369, 378, 133 S.Ct. 1886, 185 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that the exception to the reimbursement provision expressly turns on a taxpayer's proprietary interest in records summoned by the IRS strongly suggests that Congress deliberately omitted a similar requirement with respect to the notice exception in § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). And here the provision in question is not just in the same Act—it is in the adjacent section, having been enacted in the same Public Law.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,46,"Petitioners advance two primary arguments in support of their proposed legal interest test, neither of which convinces us to abandon an ordinary reading of the notice exception.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,47,"First, petitioners adopt a narrow definition of in aid of the collection. In their view, the phrase refers only to inquiries that directly advance the IRS's collection efforts. Brief for Petitioners 21. A summons will not directly advance those efforts, they contend, unless it is targeted at an account containing assets that the IRS can collect to satisfy the taxpayer's liability. And, petitioners say, the only way that a summons issued to a third party will produce collectible assets is if the delinquent taxpayer has a legal interest in the targeted account.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,48,This argument does not give a fair reading to the phrase in aid of the collection.,Roberts,0,
2022-050,49,"According to petitioners, the phrase requires that a summons produce collectible assets. But to aid means to help or assist. American Heritage Dictionary 26 (1969). Petitioners agree. See Brief for Petitioners 21 (aid means to support, help, or assist). Even if a summons may not itself reveal taxpayer assets that can be collected, it may nonetheless help the IRS find such assets.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,50,"Consider this case. The IRS's investigation suggested that Mr. Polselli often uses other entities to shield assets from the Internal Revenue Service. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a. Bryant suspected, for instance, that Mr. Polselli was using Dolce Hotel Management as an alter ego, and also that he might have access to and use of Mrs. Polselli's bank accounts. Based on those leads, Bryant initially requested that Abraham & Rose produce cancelled checks, wire transfer/credit documents, and all other instruments used by Mr. Polselli to pay the firm. Id., at 67a. Whether Mr. Polselli maintains a legal interest in those records—a confounding question, see Viewtech, 653 F.3d at 1106— is neither here nor there. The IRS could not, of course, use records of canceled checks and the like to satisfy Mr. Polselli's tax deficiency. But if those records showed that money from Dolce Hotel Management was used to pay Mr. Polselli's account at Abraham & Rose, or to pay others through Abraham & Rose, that could aid in collecting funds from Dolce Hotel Management to help pay Mr. Polselli's debt to the IRS. Or the Service could use those records to try to identify other alter egos—besides Dolce Hotel Management—where Mr. Polselli might have hidden assets.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,51,"By the same token, the summonses Bryant issued to the three banks sought records to identify  entities whose funds Mr. Polselli has control over without formal ownership and bank accounts associated with such entities. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a. As with the request Bryant issued to Abraham & Rose, even if the three bank summonses did not reveal bank accounts in which Mr. Polselli has a legal interest, they could lead to assets parked elsewhere that the IRS could collect to satisfy his $2 million liability.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,52,"IRS investigations are much like any other: A detective might order forensic testing or speak to witnesses to help identify a culprit, even if those activities are unlikely—in and of themselves—to solve the crime. Similarly, documents in the accounts belonging to Mrs. Polselli or Dolce Hotel Management may be a step in a paper trail leading to assets owned by Mr. Polselli. Everyday tasks illustrate the same point: A recipe might help a chef shop for needed groceries, even though more steps are required before dinner will be ready. By conflating activities that help advance a goal with activities sure to accomplish it, petitioners ignore the typical meaning of in aid of.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,53,"Petitioners next argue that the exception provided in clause (i) must be read narrowly so as to avoid making entirely superfluous the exception found in clause (ii). Clause (i) excuses notice when the IRS issues a summons in aid of the collection of  an assessment made or judgment rendered against the delinquent taxpayer. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). Clause (ii) exempts from notice any summons issued in aid of the collection of  the liability at law or in equity of any transferee or fiduciary of any person referred to in clause (i). § 7609(c)(2)(D)(ii). We ordinarily aim to give effect to every clause and word of a statute. Microsoft Corp. v. i4i L. P., 564 U.S. 91, 106, 131 S.Ct. 2238, 180 L.Ed.2d 131 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). If clause (i) already exempts from notice every summons that helps the IRS collect an assessment against a delinquent  taxpayer, petitioners argue, there would be no work left for clause (ii) to do. Adding a legal interest requirement, on the other hand, would cabin the scope of clause (i), leaving some purpose for clause (ii).",Roberts,0,
2022-050,54,"But this argument overlooks two differences between clause (i) and clause (ii). First, clause (i) is applicable upon an assessment, while clause (ii) is applicable upon a finding of liability. Under the Code, a taxpayer's liability for unpaid taxes arises before the IRS makes an official assessment of what the delinquent taxpayer owes. See § 6203 (The assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer .), see also United States v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114, 122, 124 S.Ct. 1548, 158 L.Ed.2d 279 (2004) (assessment refers to the calculation or recording of a tax liability). Although an assessment may trigger levy and collection efforts, Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 101, 124 S.Ct. 2276, the Code does not require in all cases that the IRS make a formal assessment before attempting to collect an outstanding tax liability. See §§ 6501(c)(1)-(3) (authorizing the IRS to bring a proceeding in court for collection of a tax  without assessment in situations involving false returns, willful attempts to evade taxes, and failures to file a return).",Roberts,0,
2022-050,55,"Second, petitioners' argument overlooks that clause (i) and clause (ii) are addressed to different entities. Clause (i) concerns assessments or judgments against a taxpayer— the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). Clause (ii), in contrast, concerns the liability of a transferee or fiduciary. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(ii). That the notice exception distinguishes between taxpayers and their fiduciaries or transferees should come as no surprise. The Code elsewhere separately empowers the IRS to collect outstanding tax liabilities from taxpayers, on the one hand, and from transferees or fiduciaries, on the other. See § 6901. The Code also differentiates between taxpayers and their fiduciaries or transferees in empowering the IRS to issue summonses in the first place. See § 7602(a).",Roberts,0,
2022-050,56,"These distinctions—between liability and assessment or judgment, and between taxpayers and their transferees or fiduciaries—are not just academic. They show that the second notice exception found in clause (ii) applies in situations where clause (i) may not. To dispense with notice, clause (i) requires that there be an assessment made or judgment rendered against the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). By contrast, clause (ii) does not impose the same conditions. It instead authorizes the IRS to issue a summons in aid of collecting a liability at law or in equity, and refers specifically to the liability of any transferee or fiduciary of the delinquent taxpayer. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(ii). As a result, clause (ii) permits the IRS to issue unnoticed summonses to aid its collection from transferees or fiduciaries before it makes an official recording of a taxpayer's liability. Direct Marketing Assn., 575 U.S. at 9, 135 S.Ct. 1124. That may not be very heavy work for the phrase to perform, but a job is a job, and enough to bar the rule against redundancy from disqualifying an otherwise sensible reading. Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U.S. 250, 258, 120 S.Ct. 740, 145 L.Ed.2d 747 (2000), see also Nielson v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 954, 969, 203 L.Ed.2d 333 (2019) (a clause that still has work to do is not superfluous).",Roberts,0,
2022-050,57,"Clause (ii) addresses an additional potential problem as well. Delinquent taxpayers sometimes declare bankruptcy or otherwise discharge debt. When they do so, the Government may not be able to collect  an assessment made or judgment rendered against the taxpayer. § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i). In those situations, clause (i) may not apply, for a summons cannot be issued in aid of an impossible collection effort. § 7609(c)(2)(D). But clause (ii) may nevertheless permit the IRS to issue unnoticed summonses to collect the liability of the taxpayer's transferee or fiduciary, § 7609(c)(2)(D)(ii).",Roberts,0,
2022-050,59,"Petitioners also emphasize the privacy concerns that led Congress to enact the notice requirement in the first place. They highlight that Congress enacted § 7609 in response to two decisions in which we gave a broad construction to the IRS's general summons power. Tiffany Fine Arts, 469 U.S. at 314, 105 S.Ct. 725. In Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971), we considered whether the employee of a company to which the IRS had issued a summons could intervene to prevent his employer's compliance with the Service's request. Id., at 527, 91 S.Ct. 534. We concluded that the employee had no right to do so. Id., at 530, 91 S.Ct. 534. And in United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. 141, 95 S.Ct. 915, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975), we approved an IRS summons issued to a bank for the purpose of identifying an unnamed individual who had deposited a large amount of money in severely deteriorated bills, concluding that the IRS had not abused its authority. Tiffany Fine Arts, 469 U.S. at 315, 105 S.Ct. 725 (characterizing Bisceglia).",Roberts,0,
2022-050,60,"Donaldson and Bisceglia help explain why Congress enacted § 7609, which establishes a baseline rule requiring the IRS to provide notice and which authorizes anyone entitled to notice to move to quash a summons. § 7609(a). But neither case obliges us to read the notice exception in § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) more narrowly than its terms provide. We think the history highlighted by petitioners supports a contrary conclusion. That Congress proved acutely aware of our prior decisions supports a plain reading not only of the general notice requirement, but also of the specific exception the statute provides.",Roberts,0,
2022-050,61,"We do not dismiss any apprehension about the scope of the IRS's authority to issue summonses. As we have said, the authority vested in tax collectors may be abused, as all power is subject to abuse. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. at 146, 95 S.Ct. 915. Tax investigations often involve the pursuit of sensitive records. In this case, for instance, the IRS sought information from law firms concerning client accounts. And even the Government concedes that the phrase in aid of the collection is not limitless. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. The Government proposes a test turning on reasonableness: So long as a summons is reasonably calculated to assisting in collection, it can fairly be characterized as being issued in aid of that collection. Id., at 26, see also id., at 36 (The third party should have some financial ties or have engaged in financial transactions with the delinquent taxpayer.).",Roberts,0,

In addition, both the briefing by the parties and the question presented focus only on whether the exception provided in § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) requires that a taxpayer maintain a legal interest in records summoned by the IRS.

2022-050,68,"Notice is not a mere formality. In the context of tax administration, it serves an important function. Providing notice ensures that, when the IRS comes calling, the implicated interests are balanced. On one hand, the notice requirement permits the IRS to summon recordkeepers for the information it needs, without imposing overly burdensome procedural hurdles or inviting excessive delay. See, e.g., § 7609(a)(2) (allowing the IRS to serve notice by mail), § 7609(b)(2) (setting time limitations on filing a motion to quash). On the other hand, notice—and the concomitant right to judicial review—empowers persons whose information is at stake to enlist assistance from the courts, as needed, to prevent the agency from overreaching. § 7609(b), see also Tiffany Fine Arts, Inc. v. United States, 469 U.S. 310, 320-321, 105 S.Ct. 725, 83 L.Ed.2d 678 (1985).",Jackson,0,
2022-050,69,"To be sure, Congress has also recognized that there might be situations, particularly in the collection context, where providing notice could frustrate the IRS's ability to effectively administer the tax laws. For instance, upon receiving notice that the IRS has served a summons, interested persons might move or hide collectable assets, making the agency's collection efforts substantially harder.",Jackson,0,
2022-050,70,"That is where the exception at § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) comes in. In such circumstances, § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) prevents notice from tipping the balance entirely in favor of the delinquent taxpayer, at the expense of the IRS. But, depending on whose information the summons seeks (for example, an innocent third party's), or the nature of the requested records, it might not be reasonable to conclude that providing notice would frustrate the IRS's tax-collection goal. And when that is the case, it might unjustifiably tip the scales in the other direction (i.e., entirely in the IRS's favor) to allow the IRS to proceed without notice just because its delinquency resolution process has entered the collection phase.",Jackson,0,
2022-050,71,"In other words, the statute's balancing of interests indicates that Congress did not give the IRS a blank check, so to speak, to do with as it will in the collection arena. Thus, in my view, courts must not interpret § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) as if that agency has been gifted with boundless authority. Treating the IRS's power to issue unnoticed summonses as effectively unlimited  permits the exception to devour the rule, upsetting the statute's calibration.",Jackson,0,
2022-050,72,"Second, and similarly, it is hard for me to believe that, in the context of a default-notice system, Congress would intentionally insert an exception that could so dramatically upend its objectives. Read too broadly, § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) would presumably permit the IRS to summon anyone's records without notice, no matter how broad the summons is or how potentially intrusive that records request might be, so long as the agency thinks doing so would provide a clue to the location of a delinquent taxpayer's assets.",Jackson,0,
2022-050,73,"Imagine, for example, a delinquent taxpayer who routinely visits his local mom-and-pop dry cleaning business. Imagine also that the IRS suspects this delinquent taxpayer sometimes uses credit cards with different names. Under a broad reading of § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i), I suppose the IRS could issue a summons to the dry cleaner's bank without notice to the dry cleaner, seeking years of the dry cleaner's financial records. The agency might believe that having the entirety of that business's financial information would aid its tax-collection efforts—even though the taxpayer has no known financial interest in that business, or any special relationship with the business's owners—because knowing what methods of payment (or aliases) the taxpayer regularly uses could help the agency track down the taxpayer's assets. And it might intend to sift through the requested haystack of the business's bank records in order to find the needle of the taxpayer's transaction information.",Jackson,0,
2022-050,74,"For their part, the dry cleaner's owners would probably look askance at having all of their financial records requisitioned and reviewed in this manner. But, without notice, they cannot object to the summons's scope or work with the IRS (and the court) to provide the records that most likely involve the delinquent taxpayer or his aliases. The owners would have to rely on the recipient of the summons (the bank) to articulate their privacy concerns and negotiate with the agency. Yet there is no guarantee under the statute that the bank will do that, and even if it does, how is the bank supposed to identify which credit cards may have been used by the delinquent taxpayer over a multiyear period?",Jackson,0,
2022-050,75,"This situation seems to me to be the kind of circumstance in which Congress would not have intended to prevent the dry cleaning business from attempting to protect its interests. And, in my view, reading § 7609 to require notice— and the potential for judicial oversight—in relation to such attenuated tax-collection activities is entirely consistent with the statutory scheme. Conversely, allowing the agency to sidestep oversight of its broad summons power by not providing notice in these kinds of situations undermines the important aims of the default-notice system.",Jackson,0,
2022-050,76,"The bottom line is this: As I read the statute, the IRS is not necessarily exempt from notice obligations any time a tax-delinquency matter enters the collection phase. Rather, the exception in § 7609(c)(2)(D)(i) merely reflects Congress's determination that, in some situations, requiring the agency to provide notice in connection with its tax-collection efforts would undermine the balance that the statute strikes with its default-notice requirement. Consequently, I believe that both courts and the IRS itself must be ever vigilant when determining when notice is not required. Doing so properly involves a careful fact-based inquiry that might well vary from case to case, depending on the scope and nature of the information the IRS seeks.",Jackson,0,
2022-051,23,"This case concerns the meaning of one provision of the federal securities laws. For many years, lower federal courts have held that liability under § 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 attaches only when a buyer can trace the shares he has purchased to a false or misleading registration statement. Recently, the Ninth Circuit parted ways with these decisions, holding that a plaintiff may sometimes recover under § 11 even when the shares he owns are not traceable to a defective registration statement. The question we face is which of these approaches best conforms to the statute's terms.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,25,"Together, the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq., and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq., form the backbone of American securities law. The first is `narrower' and focused `primarily' on the regulation of new offerings. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 572, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995) (quoting Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 752, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975)). Generally speaking, the 1933 Act requires a company to register the securities it intends to offer to the public with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b(a)(8), 77e, see also § 77d. As part of that process, a company must prepare a registration statement that includes detailed information about the firm's business and financial health so prospective buyers may fairly assess whether to invest. See, e.g., §§ 77f, 77g, 77aa. The law imposes strict liability on issuing companies when their registration statements contain material misstatements or misleading omissions. § 77k, see also Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 380, 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983).",Gorsuch,0,

2022-051,28,"This case arises from a public offering governed by the 1933 Act. Typically, when a company goes public it issues new shares pursuant to a registration statement. That registration statement is filed with the SEC and made available to the public. Investment banks underwrite the offering, usually by buying these new registered shares at a negotiated price and then selling them to investors at a higher price. In this way, underwriters often carry the risk of loss should they fail to sell the shares at a profit. See 1 L. Loss, J. Seligman, & T. Paredes, Securities Regulation 738-748 (6th ed. 2019), Hazen 32-33.",Gorsuch,0,

To prevent the stock price from falling once public trading begins, underwriters may require insiders to consent to a lockup agreement—a commitment to hold their unregistered shares for a period of time before selling them on the new public market.

2022-051,30,"Initial public offerings (IPOs) are an effective way of raising capital, but they also have drawbacks. Among other things, they can involve significant transaction costs. Nor is raising capital the only reason firms might wish to go public, some may simply wish to afford their shareholders (whether investors, employees, or others) the convenience of being able to sell their existing shares on a public exchange. See 73 Fed. Reg. 54442 (2008). Several years ago, a number of companies approached the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) about the possibility of selling shares publicly on that exchange without an IPO.

Slack Technologies, Inc., 13 F.4th 940, 944, 947 (C.A.9 2021). As part of that process, Slack filed a registration statement for a specified number of registered shares it intended to offer in its direct listing. Pirani v. Slack Technologies, Inc., 445 F.Supp.3d 367, 373 (ND Cal. 2020). But because Slack employed a direct listing rather than an IPO, there was no underwriter and no lockup agreement. 13 F.4th at 951 (MILLER, J., dissenting).

For all anyone could tell, he may have purchased unregistered shares unconnected to the registration statement and its representations about the firm's business and financial health. Of course, Slack would go on to acknowledge that the 1934 Act allows investors to recover for fraud in the sale of unregistered shares upon proof of scienter.

2022-051,36,We begin with the relevant language of § 11(a) of the 1933 Act. It provides:,Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,37,"In case any part of the registration statement, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring such security (unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition he knew of such untruth or omission) may, either at law or in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, sue certain enumerated parties. 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,38,"The statute authorizes an individual to sue for a material misstatement or omission in a registration statement when he has acquired such security. The question we face is what this means. Does the term such security refer to a security issued pursuant to the allegedly misleading registration statement? Or can the term also sometimes encompass a security that was not issued pursuant to the allegedly misleading registration statement? Slack advances the first interpretation, Mr. Pirani defends the second.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,39,"Immediately, we face a bit of a challenge. The word such usually refers  to something that has already been described or that is implied or intelligible from the context or circumstances. Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English 1218 (1931), see also Webster's New International Dictionary 2518 (2d ed. 1954). But there is no clear referent in § 11(a) telling us what such security means. As a result, we must ascertain the statute's critical referent from the context or circumstances.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,40,"As it turns out, context provides several clues. For one thing, the statute imposes liability for false statements or misleading omissions in the registration statement. § 77k (emphasis added). Not just a registration statement or any registration statement. The statute uses the definite article to reference the particular registration statement alleged to be misleading, and in this way seems to suggest the plaintiff must acquire such security under that document's terms. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,41,"For another thing, the statute repeatedly uses the word such to narrow the law's focus. The statute directs us to such part of the registration statement that contains a misstatement or misleading omission. It speaks of such acquisition when a person has acquired securities pursuant to the registration statement. And it points to such untruth or omission found in the registration statement. Each time, the law trains our view on particular things or statements. All of which suggests that, when it comes to such security, the law speaks to a security registered under the particular registration statement alleged to contain a falsehood or misleading omission.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,42,"Other provisions in the 1933 Act follow suit. Under § 5, for example, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful to sell such security. § 77e(a). Here, the term such security clearly refers to shares subject to registration. Meanwhile, § 6 provides that a registration statement shall be deemed effective only as to the securities specified therein as proposed to be offered. § 77f(a). It's an instruction that would seem hard to square with Mr. Pirani's broader reading of § 11(a)—after all, adopting that reading would give the registration statement effect (in the sense of creating liability) for securities that are not specified in the registration statement as proposed to be offered.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,43,"Beyond these clues lies still another. Section 11(e) caps damages against an underwriter in a § 11 suit to the total price at which the securities underwritten by him and distributed to the public were offered to the public. § 77k(e). This provision thus ties the maximum available recovery to the value of the registered shares alone. It's another feature that makes little sense on Mr. Pirani's account, for if § 11(a) liability extended beyond registered shares presumably available damages would too. See Barnes v. Osofsky, 373 F.2d 269, 272 (C.A.2 1967), Brief for SEC as Amicus Curiae in Barnes v. Osofsky, No. 30867 etc. (CA2), pp. 4-5.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,44,"Collectively, these contextual clues persuade us that Slack's reading of the law is the better one. Nor is anything we say here particularly novel. For while direct listings are new, the question how far § 11(a) liability extends is not. More than half a century ago, Judge Friendly addressed the question in an opinion for the Second Circuit in Barnes and concluded that the narrower reading we adopt today is the more natural one. 373 F.2d at 271, 273. Since Barnes, every court of appeals to consider the issue has reached the same conclusion: To bring a claim under § 11, the securities held by the plaintiff must be traceable to the particular registration statement alleged to be false or  misleading.2 Until this decision, even the Ninth Circuit seemed to take the same view. Hertzberg v. Dignity Partners, Inc., 191 F.3d 1076, 1080, and n. 4 (1999).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,45,"Resisting this conclusion, Mr. Pirani argues that we should read the phrase such security to include not only securities traceable to a defective registration statement. We should also read the phrase to include other securities that bear some sort of minimal relationship to a defective registration statement. And, he argues, a reading like that would allow his case to proceed because, but for the existence of Slack's registration statement for the registered shares, its unregistered shares would not have been eligible for sale to the public. Brief for Respondent 22-23. Beyond assuring us that the rule he proposes would save his case, however, Mr. Pirani does not offer much more. He does not explain what the limits of his rule would be, how we might derive them from § 11, or how any of this can be squared with the various contextual clues we have encountered suggesting that liability runs with registered shares alone.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,46,"Perhaps the closest Mr. Pirani comes to answering these questions comes when he directs us to § 5. If Congress wanted liability under § 11(a) to attach only to securities issued pursuant to a particular registration statement, he observes, it could have simply borrowed similar language from § 5. That provision, he stresses, speaks of any security with respect to which a registration statement has been filed. § 77e(b)(1). But even taken on its own terms, this argument does not prove much. If Mr. Pirani's example shows that Congress could have written § 11(a) to explain more clearly that liability attaches only to securities issued pursuant to a particular registration statement, it also shows that Congress could have written § 11(a) to explain more clearly that liability attaches to any security or any security bearing some specified relationship to a registration statement. That Congress could have been clearer, no one disputes. But none of this proves it adopted anything like the rule Mr. Pirani proposes.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,47,"Finally, Mr. Pirani argues from policy and purpose. Adopting a broader reading of such security would, he says, expand liability for falsehoods and misleading omissions and thus better accomplish the purpose of the 1933 Act. We cannot endorse this line of reasoning. This Court does not presume  that any result consistent with one party's account of the statute's overarching goal must be the law. Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.S. 79, 89, 137 S.Ct. 1718, 198 L.Ed.2d 177 (2017). Nor, for that matter, is Mr. Pirani's account of the law's purpose altogether obvious. As we have seen, the 1933 Act is limited in scope. Herman & MacLean, 459 U.S. at 382, 103 S.Ct. 683. Its main liability provision imposes strict liability on issuers for material falsehoods or misleading omissions in the registration statement. Ibid. Meanwhile, the 1934 Act requires ongoing disclosures for publicly traded companies and its main liability provision allows suits involving any sale of a security but only on proof of scienter. Ibid., Hazen 99-100. Given this design, it seems equally possible that Congress sought a balanced liability regime that allows a narrow class of claims to  proceed on lesser proof but requires a higher standard of proof to sustain a broader set of claims.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-051,49,"Naturally, Congress remains free to revise the securities laws at any time, whether to address the rise of direct listings or any other development. Our only function lies in discerning and applying the law as we find it. And because we think the better reading of the particular provision before us requires a plaintiff to plead and prove that he purchased shares traceable to the allegedly defective registration statement, we vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment holding otherwise. Whether Mr. Pirani's pleadings can satisfy § 11(a) as properly construed, we leave for that court to decide in the first instance on remand.3",Gorsuch,0,

To take an illustrative formulation, obstruction of justice covers the crime or act of willfully interfering with the process of justice and law, including by influencing, threatening, harming, or impeding a witness, potential witness, juror, or judicial or legal officer or by furnishing false information in or otherwise impeding an investigation or legal process. Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 337 (1996). The offense captures every willful act of corruption, intimidation, or force that tends somehow to impair the machinery of the civil or criminal law.

See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(a)(1)(A), (b)(1). That statute provides that an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense. § 1512(f)(1). Likewise, § 1519 forbids assorted means of destroying, altering, or falsifying records with an intent to obstruct certain investigations or proceedings. That provision covers acts intended to impede a federal investigation or proceeding, including one not even on the verge of commencement. Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 547, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015) (plurality opinion), see also 18 U.S.C. § 1518 (proscribing acts to obstruct the communication of certain information to criminal investigators).1",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,40,"The Solicitor General explains that many state obstruction offenses as of 1996 similarly did not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 914.22(3)(a) (1997), N. D. Cent. Code Ann. § 12.1-09-01(3)(c) (1997), State v. O'Neill, 165 Vt. 270, 682 A.2d 943 (1996), Brief for Attorney General 36-43 (collecting statutes), see also Commonwealth v. Berry, 141 Ky. 477, 481, 133 S.W. 212, 213 (1911), cf. Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U.S., at 395-397, 137 S.Ct. 1562 (looking to state statutes). Some States did not label the relevant offenses as obstruction of justice, but instead labeled the offenses with a more precise term for the particular category of obstruction at issue, such as witness tampering. But Congress accounted for the variations in labels by crafting the relevant definition in § 1101(a)(43)(S) to cover offenses relating to obstruction of justice, not just offenses labeled as obstruction of justice. In any event, the terminology that States use to categorize criminal offenses is not dispositive because our inquiry here does not turn on technical definitions and labels under state law. Taylor, 495 U.S., at 590, 110 S.Ct. 2143.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,41,"For obstruction offenses, the Model Penal Code also generally does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. See generally ALI, Model Penal Code § 240.0(4), p. 3 (1980) (`official proceedings' include those which may be heard). For witness tampering, for example, the Model Penal Code focuses on an actor's intent to tamper with a witness, not whether an investigation or proceeding is pending. See id., § 241.6, Comment 2, at 166-167 (What is important is not that the actor believe that an official proceeding or investigation will begin within a certain span of time but rather that he recognize that his conduct threatens obstruction of justice).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,42,"That extensive body of authority— dictionaries, federal laws, state laws, and the Model Penal Code—reflects common sense. Individuals can obstruct the process of justice even when an investigation or proceeding is not pending. For example, a murderer may threaten to kill a witness if the witness reports information to the police. Such an act is no less obstructive merely because the government has yet to catch on and begin an investigation. As the Solicitor General persuasively states, one can obstruct the wheels of justice even before the wheels have begun to move,  indeed, obstruction of justice is often most effective when it prevents an investigation or proceeding from commencing in the first place. Brief for Attorney General 15.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,43,"Importantly, if an offense relating to obstruction of justice under § 1101(a)(43)(S) required that an investigation or proceeding be pending, then many common obstruction offenses would not qualify as aggravated felonies under that provision. We decline to interpret § 1101(a)(43)(S) to exclude numerous heartland obstruction offenses. We should not lightly conclude that Congress enacted a self-defeating statute. Quarles v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1872, 1879, 204 L.Ed.2d 200 (2019), see also, e.g., Stokeling v. United States, 586 U.

2022-052,44,"One final point bears emphasis: To the extent any doubt remains about whether § 1101(a)(43)(S) requires that an investigation or proceeding be pending, the phrase relating to obstruction of justice resolves the doubt. Cf. Mellouli v. Lynch, 575 U.S. 798, 811-812, n. 11, 135 S.Ct. 1980, 192 L.Ed.2d 60 (2015). The phrase relating to ensures that this statute covers offenses that have a connection with obstruction of justice—which surely covers common obstruction offenses that can occur when an investigation or proceeding is not pending. Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 581 U.S. 87, 96, 137 S.Ct. 1190, 197 L.Ed.2d 572 (2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, in defining certain other aggravated felonies in this statute, Congress did not employ the broad phrase relating to. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A) (murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,45,"For all of those reasons, an offense relating to obstruction of justice under § 1101(a)(43)(S) does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending.2",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,47,Pugin and Cordero-Garcia offer four main arguments in response. None is persuasive.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,48,"First, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia point to 18 U.S.C. § 1503(a), which among other things prohibits persons from endeavoring to influence, obstruct, or impede the due administration of justice. According to Pugin and Cordero-Garcia, that specific prohibition requires that an investigation or proceeding be pending. Cf. Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197,  207, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893). But even if they are correct about that point, § 1503(a) is only one obstruction offense among the many obstruction offenses in Title 18. And many federal obstruction offenses —like many state obstruction offenses —proscribe obstruction when an investigation or proceeding is not pending. Moreover, if Congress wanted to define offenses relating to obstruction of justice to have the same coverage as § 1503(a), Congress knew how to do so: Congress could have cross-referenced § 1503(a) in § 1101(a)(43)(S) in the same way that Congress cross-referenced numerous other statutes in § 1101(a)(43). See, e.g., §§ 1101(a)(43)(B)-(F). But Congress included no such cross-reference to § 1503(a) in § 1101(a)(43)(S).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,49,"Second, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia cite a few authorities from the 1700s and 1800s and assert that obstruction of justice historically required that an investigation or proceeding be pending. But the historical record cited by Pugin and Cordero-Garcia does not back up their broad claim. See, e.g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 126 (1769) (explaining without qualification that endeavoring to dissuade a witness from giving evidence was an impediment of justice). More to the point, as we have explained at length, the widespread and contemporary understanding of obstruction of justice at the time Congress enacted § 1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996 did not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. Cf. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 593, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,50,"Third, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia argue that offenses relating to obstruction of justice require a pending investigation or proceeding, otherwise, they maintain that those offenses would be redundant with other offenses covered by § 1101(a)(43)(S)—in particular, offenses relating to  perjury or subornation of perjury, or bribery of a witness. But Pugin and Cordero-Garcia fail to explain how requiring a pending investigation or proceeding for obstruction offenses would resolve the claimed redundancies with perjury or bribery offenses. After all, perjury and bribery offenses often relate to obstruction of justice. In any event, redundancies are common in statutory drafting —sometimes in a congressional effort to be doubly sure, sometimes because of congressional inadvertence or lack of foresight, or sometimes simply because of the shortcomings of human communication. Barton v. Barr, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1442, 1453, 206 L.Ed.2d 682 (2020). As a result, the better overall reading of the statute sometimes contains some redundancy. Ibid., Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Christian, 590 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5, 140 S.Ct. 1335, 1350, 206 L.Ed.2d 516 (2020), Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 873, 881, 203 L.Ed.2d 180 (2019). Section 1101(a)(43) illustrates the point: Congress listed a large number of offenses that would qualify as aggravated felonies, likely to avoid unintended gaps. So it is not surprising to find some overlap. To take one example, the definition of aggravated felony covers murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor and separately covers crimes of violence. §§ 1101(a)(43)(A), (F).3  Fourth, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia invoke the rule of lenity. But even assuming that the rule of lenity can be invoked in this particular civil immigration context, the rule applies only if after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, there remains grievous ambiguity. Ocasio v. United States, 578 U.S. 282, 295, n. 8, 136 S.Ct. 1423, 194 L.Ed.2d 520 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, applying the traditional tools of statutory interpretation, we have concluded that an offense relating to obstruction of justice does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. So we have no basis for resorting to the rule of lenity. See, e.g., Shaw v. United States, 580 U.S. 63, 71, 137 S.Ct. 462, 196 L.Ed.2d 373 (2016), Salman v. United States, 580 U.S. 39, 51, 137 S.Ct. 420, 196 L.Ed.2d 351 (2016), Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188, n. 10, 134 S.Ct. 2259, 189 L.Ed.2d 262 (2014), cf. Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 489, 132 S.Ct. 1166, 182 L.Ed.2d 1 (2012).* * *",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-052,51,"In sum, we conclude that an offense relating to obstruction of justice under § 1101(a)(43)(S) does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. We therefore disagree with the argument raised by Pugin and Cordero-Garcia for excluding their obstruction offenses from the broad coverage of § 1101(a)(43)(S). We affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-052,54,"I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit wrongly embraced a pending-proceeding requirement when it assessed what types of prior offenses qualify as offenses relating to obstruction of justice under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S), for purposes of determining the aggravated felonies that render noncitizens deportable, § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). This means, of course, that I also agree with the Court's conclusion that the Fourth Circuit rightly rejected any such pending-proceeding requirement.",Jackson,0,
2022-052,55,"I write separately to highlight one (possibly sufficient) reason why a predicate offense need not have a nexus to a pending or ongoing investigation or judicial proceeding in order to qualify as an offense relating to obstruction of justice within the meaning of this immigration statute. The reason is that, when Congress inserted the phrase offense relating to obstruction of justice into § 1101(a)(43)(S), it might well have been referencing a specific and previously designated category of offenses —the offenses that are grouped together in Chapter 73 of Title 18 of the U. S. Code, under the heading Obstruction of Justice. 62 Stat. 769, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1501 et seq. And not all of the offenses that are addressed in Chapter 73 contain a pending-proceeding requirement.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-052,56,"What counts as an offense relating to obstruction of justice within the meaning of § 1101(a)(43)(S) is nothing more, or less, than what Congress intended that phrase to mean when it enacted that statute. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not expressly define the phrase, so we apply the normal tools of statutory interpretation to `see what Congress  probably meant' by it. Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 581 U.S. 385, 391, 137 S.Ct. 1562, 198 L.Ed.2d 22 (2017) (quoting Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 53, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006)). In my view, our job in this regard is a limited one: We are called upon to understand and implement whatever Congress meant by that unadorned phrase.",Jackson,0,
2022-052,57,"When Congress selected the words offense relating to obstruction of justice and inserted them into the INA in 1996, 110 Stat. 1277-1278, Congress's longest standing and most significant use of the phrase obstruction of justice in the Statutes at Large was its description of Chapter 73 of Title 18 as concerning obstruction of justice. 62 Stat. 769, see also 104 Stat. 4861 (describing Chapter 73 as relating to obstruction of justice when adding an offense to that Chapter in 1990). To me, this is a powerful contextual clue that Congress may have simply—and solely— been drawing on its own existing understanding of which particular offenses are properly characterized as such. Accord, Flores v. Attorney General, 856 F.3d 280, 287-289 (CA3 2017) (refusing to look beyond Chapter 73 to determine whether an alien's prior offense `relates to obstruction of justice' because § 1101(a)(43)(S)'s text  indicates Congress's intention to reference Chapter 73). In deciding the cases before us, I would not want to rule out (even inadvertently) the possibility that Chapter 73 is Congress's actual benchmark with respect to what qualifies as an offense relating to obstruction of justice for § 1101(a)(43)(S) purposes, rather than just a mere clue to some platonic, judicially divined meaning of Congress's chosen words.",Jackson,0,
2022-052,58,"I believe that hewing closely to Congress's will in this regard is especially important where (as here) making the determination of which offenses qualify implicates the drastic deportation sanction. Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 231, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951). In our constitutional system, the Legislature makes legal policy judgments regarding the particular circumstances that trigger the consequences that are associated with criminal convictions. Accord, United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265, and n. 5, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997). And it seems at least plausible that Congress's description of certain aggravated felonies, § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as offenses relating to obstruction of justice, § 1101(a)(43)(S), may embody its judgment to peg that subset of aggravated felonies to Chapter 73, not an intent to leave the category without form for future judicial refinement. Of course, if Congress has already thus decided which obstruction-related convictions so trigger the INA's aggravated-felony provision, this Court need not, and indeed should not, cobble together a generic offense definition from nonstatutory sources (which risks sweeping in offenses that Congress did not mean to capture).",Jackson,0,
2022-052,59,"Here, the Court correctly emphasizes Chapter 73's importance in the course of analyzing whether a possible predicate offense must have a nexus to a pending proceeding in order to qualify as an aggravated felony. Ante, at 1839-1840. But these parties have not fully ventilated the arguments for and against the possibility that Chapter 73 might define (in substance) the universe of offenses that relate to obstruction of justice, § 1101(a)(43)(S), as Congress meant that phrase to be interpreted. Nor would running that issue to ground here change the outcome.1 As the Court notes, multiple  Chapter 73 offenses require no pending proceeding. § 1512(f), see also 102 Stat. 4397-4398 (1988 Congress describing an amendment to § 1512 as an obstruction of justice amendment (boldface deleted)). That suffices to resolve the question before us even under a Chapter 73-focused approach. The issue of whether such an approach best tracks Congress's intent can be reserved for future consideration in a case where the parties joust in earnest on the question.",Jackson,0,

2022-052,61,"From early American laws, to dictionaries, to modern federal and state obstruction statutes, interference with an ongoing investigation or proceeding is at the core of what it means to be an offense relating to obstruction of justice, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S). The Court circumvents this ample evidence only by casting a wide net and then throwing back all but the bycatch. That approach turns the categorical approach on its head, Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 581 U.S. 385, 393, 137 S.Ct. 1562, 198 L.Ed.2d 22 (2017), and subverts the commonly understood meaning of obstruction of justice when Congress enacted § 1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,63,"The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines aggravated felony by enumerating a long list of offenses. § 1101(a)(43). Some are federal criminal offenses, but others are undefined generic offenses, such as burglary, § 1101(a)(43)(G), and obstruction of justice, § 1101(a) (43)(S), which is relevant here.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,64,"To assess whether someone's conviction is covered by a generic offense, our precedents dictate that courts use the categorical approach. Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U.S., at 389, 137 S.Ct. 1562. That approach disregards facts about the conviction and instead compares the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant's conviction with the elements of the `generic' crime—i.e., the offense as commonly understood. Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 257, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). If the elements of the underlying crime of conviction are narrower than or the same as the elements of the generic offense, then there is a categorical match, Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 190, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), and the underlying offense is an aggravated felony. If there is no categorical match, then the conviction is not an aggravated felony, no matter the underlying facts.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,65,"Before a court can engage in this categorical comparison, however, it must discern the basic elements of the relevant generic offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Courts accomplish this task by looking for evidence about the generic meaning of the offense at the time of the statute's enactment. Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U.S., at 395, 137 S.Ct. 1562. This means looking for the generally accepted contemporary meaning of the generic offense, while setting aside more unusual nongeneric variants that are defined  more broadly. Taylor, 495 U.S., at 596, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In Taylor, for example, this Court concluded, after surveying various sources of meaning, that for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), generic burglary encompasses any crime having the basic elements of unlawful or  unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime. 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In reaching that conclusion, the Court purposefully excluded burglary convictions in a handful of States that defined burglary more broadly by eliminating the requirement that the entry be unlawful, or by including places, such as automobiles and vending machines, other than buildings. Ibid. Expanding the definition to include those statutes would have strayed too far from the generic definition of bribery  intended by Congress. Id., at 595, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,66,"The question presented in these cases— whether an offense relating to obstruction of justice, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a) (43)(S), necessarily involves a pending investigation or proceeding—is a question about the basic elements of generic obstruction of justice. Taylor, 495 U.S., at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. That is, it is a question about how obstruction of justice was commonly understood, Descamps, 570 U.S., at 257, 133 S.Ct. 2276, in 1996 when Congress enacted § 1101(a)(43)(S). Answering that question requires focusing on the core, generally accepted contemporary meaning, Taylor, 495 U.S., at 596, 110 S.Ct. 2143, of obstruction of justice, rather than on more unusual nongeneric variants that are defined more broadly, id., at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,67,"The Court loses sight of this fundamental point. Instead of focusing on whether a pending investigation or proceeding is part of the heartland of obstruction of justice, it wanders off into an array of obstruction-adjacent federal and state laws that do not require a pending investigation or proceeding. The Court then announces that those offenses are core obstruction of justice, even though the evidence it relies on, taken as a whole, reveals they are not. The result is predictable. By defining offenses that do not require a pending investigation or proceeding as core obstruction of justice, the majority forces through the conclusion that a pending investigation or proceeding is not required to qualify as generic obstruction of justice.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,68,"A reexamination of the sources relied upon by the majority, with the appropriate focus on discerning the trunk of obstruction of justice, rather than its various branches or offshoots, leads to the opposite result: To qualify as an offense relating to obstruction of justice under § 1101(a) (43)(S), a predicate offense must require a pending investigation or proceeding.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,70,"As an initial matter, the majority glosses over the critical fact that obstruction of justice was an established term of art at the time of § 1101(a)(43)(S)'s enactment in 1996.

Act of Mar. 2, 1831, ch. 99, 4 Stat. 488 (emphasis added). This provision, which became § 5399 of the Revised Statutes, see Rev.

After describing the law as criminalizing obstruction of the due administration of justice in any court of the United States, the Court explained that such obstruction can only arise when justice is being administered. Id., at 207, 13 S.Ct. 542. Unless that fact exists, the statutory offense cannot be committed. Ibid.

Moreover, this language, just like the language at § 1101(a)(43)(S), serves the purpose of identifying one of a long list of underlying offenses to which an overarching statute applies. Thus, by 1996, Congress had used the same phrase for the same purpose to refer to § 1503. In fact, the INA's list of aggravated felonies explicitly cross-references RICO, suggesting Congress was well aware of the parallel.

2022-052,75,"In short, in searching for the heartland of obstruction of justice, the omnibus clause of § 1503 and the history from which it is derived are invaluable touchstones. Neither countenances an obstruction of justice offense separate from a pending investigation or proceeding.2  B",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,76,"Even setting this crucial historical evidence aside, and proceeding as the Court does, by looking to dictionary definitions, chapter 73 of the Federal Criminal Code, state statutes, and the Model Penal Code, the same result emerges: Core obstruction of justice requires a pending investigation or proceeding.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,78,"Begin with the central dictionary definition upon which the Court relies. It defines obstruction of justice as the crime or act of willfully interfering with the process of justice and law esp. by influencing, threatening, harming, or impeding a witness, potential witness, juror, or judicial or legal officer or by furnishing false information in or otherwise impeding an investigation or legal process. Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 337 (1996) (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,79,"While the Court claims that this definition omits any requirement of a pending investigation or proceeding, ante, at 1839-1840, the two italicized phrases say otherwise. Interference means the act of meddling in or hampering an activity or process, Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1178 (1993), while impede means to interfere with or get in the way of the progress of something or someone, id., at 1132. The definition is clear that the process that is meddled in, or interfered with, is the process of justice and law or an investigation or legal process.3",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,80,"For the same reason, the majority is too hasty when it asserts that the definition encompasses acts separate from a pending investigation or proceeding. That definition ends with the phrase in  an investigation or legal process. Under the series-qualifier canon, that phrase is best read to modify all listed verbs, especially because the definition lists each action as an example of the crime or act of willfully interfering with the process of justice and law. See Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 592 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1163, 1169, 209 L.Ed.2d 272 (2021) (When there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a series, a modifier at the end of the list normally applies to the entire series (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, far from favoring the majority's view, the definition most naturally supports the conclusion that interference with a pending investigation or proceeding is an element of generic obstruction of justice.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,81,"The other dictionary definitions upon which the Court relies similarly indicate the need for a pending investigation or proceeding. The majority notes that Black's Law Dictionary defines obstruction of justice to cover `obstructing the administration of justice in any way,' ante, at 1839, but overlooks the fact that administration of justice, both historically and currently, refers to court proceedings. See, e.g., 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *290 (The judiciary power is intrusted with the administration of justice), Black's Law Dictionary 53 (10th ed. 2014) (defining due administration of justice as the proper functioning and integrity of a court or other tribunal and the proceedings before it). Similarly, the full definition from A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage mentions interference with the orderly administration of law. B. Garner, p. 611 (2d ed. 1995). The cited definitions thus all weigh against the majority's sweeping view, and in favor of the view that obstruction of justice can only arise when justice is being administered. Pettibone, 148 U.S., at 207, 13 S.Ct. 542.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,83,"The federal offenses listed in chapter 73 of Title 18, which is entitled Obstruction of Justice, provide further support for the conclusion that core obstruction of justice requires the administration of justice.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,84,"When Congress codified chapter 73 in 1948, the chapter contained six provisions, each of which requires a connection to a pending proceeding or investigation. See Act of June 25, 1948, §§ 1501-1506, 62 Stat. 769-770. The central provision is § 1503, with its omnibus or catchall prohibition against endeavoring to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice. As already explained, supra, at 1847, it is undisputed that § 1503's omnibus clause requires a pending proceeding. The same is true for the other five provisions, all of which either refer to ongoing legal processes or cover conduct that can arise only during legal proceedings.4",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,85,"By the time Congress passed 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996, Congress had added nine narrower, more specific offenses to the six original offenses (§§ 1501-1506) in chapter 73. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1507-1513, 1516-1517.5 While it is less clear that those specialized provisions fall within the heartland of obstruction of justice, even the vast majority of them require a connection to a proceeding or investigation.6 See § 1507 (picketing  or parading with the intent to interfere with the administration of justice), § 1508 (listening to or recording jury deliberations or voting), § 1510 (interference with reports of information to a criminal investigator), § 1516 (interfering with a Federal auditor in the performance of official duties), § 1509 (interfering with due exercise of rights under a court order), § 1513 (retaliating against a witness for participating in an official proceeding).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,86,"The primary outlier amongst the more recent additions to chapter 73 is § 1512, which criminalizes tampering with a witness, victim, or informant. As the majority notes, that provision provides that for purposes of this section  an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense. § 1512(f)(1). Instead of favoring the majority's conclusion, however, § 1512 is the exception that proves the rule. There would be no need to clarify that the provision applies absent a pending proceeding unless there were an established background understanding that obstruction of justice requires such a proceeding.7 Because the question at hand concerns the meaning of heartland obstruction of justice, excluding nongeneric variants defined more broadly, Taylor, 495 U.S., at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, what matters here is the general rule, not a singular exception to it. To use a lighthearted example, it is clear that the generic meaning of mammal includes giving birth to live young, even though the platypus is an exception to that rule. Section 1512 thus proves the opposite of what the majority takes it to prove.8",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,87,"The Court instead reasons that because § 1512 does not require a pending investigation or proceeding, the answer to the question Does generic obstruction of justice require a pending investigation or proceeding? must be No. That line of thinking, however, simply assumes that § 1512 falls within generic obstruction (it assumes the platypus is heartland mammalia). In so assuming, the Court loses sight of the task at hand, which is, again, to answer a question about the trunk of obstruction of justice, not more broadly defined offshoots. See Descamps, 570 U.S., at 257, 133 S.Ct. 2276. All signs point toward  treating § 1512 as just such an offshoot, at least insofar as it explicitly chooses to dispose with the requirement that a proceeding be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense. § 1512(f)(1).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,89,"The text of the INA itself confirms that Congress did not understand obstruction of justice to encompass all witness tampering. In the very same subsection of the INA at issue here, Congress expressly used the term witness tampering separately from obstruction of justice. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii). Specifically, in a set of provisions defining U nonimmigrant status,9 Congress again enumerated a list of offenses, many of which overlap with the aggravated felonies in § 1101(a)(43). See § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii), cf. §§ 1101(a)(43). Just as it did for aggravated felonies, Congress included obstruction of justice in the list. This time, however, Congress added witness tampering in addition to obstruction of justice by listing witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or perjury as distinct offenses. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii), cf. § 1101(a)(43)(S) (obstruction of justice, perjury or subornation of perjury, or bribery of a witness).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,90,"The Court's broad interpretation of obstruction of justice, which swallows up all witness tampering, cannot be reconciled with this statutory text. If, on the one hand, the Court applies the same broad meaning to obstruction of justice in § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii), then witness tampering becomes redundant, in violation of the canon that statutes should be read so as to avoid rendering superfluous any parts thereof. Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 112, 111 S.Ct. 2166, 115 L.Ed.2d 96 (1991). If, on the other hand, the Court attempts to avoid this problem by interpreting obstruction of justice differently across the two provisions, then it violates the established canon of construction that similar language contained within the same section of a statute must be accorded a consistent meaning. National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 501, 118 S.Ct. 927, 140 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998). Either way, the Court's interpretation fails.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,91,"Although § 1101(a)(43)(S) refers to an offense relating to obstruction of justice, while § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) refers to criminal activity  involving  obstruction of justice or any similar activity, these textual differences only reinforce that Congress understood obstruction of justice and witness tampering to have quite different ordinary meanings. Given that § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) covers not just obstruction of justice but any similar activity, one must infer that Congress took witness tampering to be not only distinct from obstruction of justice, but distinct enough to need separate mention from obstruction of justice or any similar activity.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,92,"Nor does it matter that § 1101(a)(15)(U) was added to the INA in 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. 114 Stat. 1534. On the contrary, the fact that Congress understood obstruction of justice to be distinct from witness tampering just four years after enacting § 1101(a)(43)(S) is good evidence Congress understood the same to be true in 1996, when it deemed obstruction of justice an aggravated felony under the INA. After all, no one here suggests that the ordinary understanding in the years  after 1996 somehow differed from the ordinary understanding in 1996. Ante, at 1840, n. 1.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,94,"State law points to the same result as the other indicia of meaning examined thus far. State law is relevant because, in discerning the generic meaning of terms with common-law roots, the Court will often survey state statutes in effect at the time the federal statute in question was enacted. See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598-599, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (considering how burglary was understood in the criminal codes of most States). Here, when § 1101(a)(43)(S) was enacted in 1996, 13 States and the District of Columbia had a crime deemed obstruction of or obstructing justice. The majority of those state statutes (eight in total) required a connection to an investigation or proceeding that was pending, or at least reasonably foreseeable, while the remainder were ambiguous on the matter.10 Thus, when § 1101(a)(43)(S) was added to the INA in 1996, obstruction of justice `generally' or `typically' required such a connection. Id., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,95,"The majority avoids this conclusion only by, once again, adopting a circular approach. In analyzing state law, the majority looks exclusively to state witness tampering statutes, which it simply assumes are state obstruction offenses. Ante, at 1840. It then concludes that because many of those statutes do not require a pending investigation or proceeding, neither does obstruction of justice under the INA. Ibid. As should be clear by now, that method gets the categorical approach backward, if the overarching federal category is assumed to include the state offenses in question, there will always be a categorical match. One cannot prove that all state witness tampering laws fall within the INA's relating to obstruction of justice simply by assuming that they do.11",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,96,"The majority also relies on the Model Penal Code (MPC). Ante, at 1840-1841. Although the MPC sometimes can provide supplemental evidence of generic meaning, see Taylor, 495 U.S., at 598, n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 2143, it is critical to bear in mind that the  MPC is fundamentally a reform movement. United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 403, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). Where that reform involves a definitive break from the state of the law at the time in question, the MPC is of limited value in discerning generic meaning. Such is the case here. The MPC eschews any talk of obstruction of justice, and instead sets out a series of articles under the heading Offenses Against Public Administration. ALI, MPC §§ 240-243 (1980). Those articles cover many offenses, such as escape from prison (§ 242.6), perjury (§ 241.1), and bribery (§ 240.1) that are clearly not generic obstruction of justice (indeed, perjury and bribery are listed separately from obstruction of justice in § 1101(a)(43)(S)). Even in the article that most closely parallels traditional obstruction of justice (§ 242.1 Obstructing Administration of Law or Other Governmental Function), the MPC gave the word `obstructs' an expansive meaning, § 242.1, Comment 2, at 203, and intended for the offense described to reach all legitimate activities of government, not just the administration of justice, id., at 203-204. Because of these departures, which have not been widely adopted, the MPC carries little weight for purposes of discerning the core that forms generic obstruction of justice.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,97,"Despite these issues, the majority focuses, again without justification, on the MPC's description of witness tampering (§ 241.6). See ante, at 1840-1841. Even setting aside the now-familiar circularity of this reasoning, this definition does not help the majority either. In describing witness tampering, the MPC reformers chose to depart from laws requiring that a proceeding or investigation actually be pending, § 241.6, Comment 2, at 166, by requiring only a belief that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, § 241.6(1) (emphasis added). That intentional departure is reason alone to treat this MPC description with caution when articulating generic obstruction of justice. Yet, the majority goes much further than the MPC reformers by dismissing the notion that at least a foreseeable investigation or proceeding should be required. See ante, at 1841, n. 2. That statement by the Court reflects just how far afield it has wandered from the heartland of obstruction of justice.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,98,"Perhaps sensing the weakness of its evidence, the Court falls back on the Government's commonsense point, Reply Brief 4, that one can obstruct the wheels of justice even before the wheels have begun to move, ante, at 1840. Yet the intuitive idea that obstruction can only arise when justice is being administered, Pettibone, 148 U.S., at 207, 13 S.Ct. 542, finds support in common sense to at least the same degree. But while both formulations find some support in common sense, the same cannot be said regarding other clues about generic meaning. Considered together, the relevant history, dictionaries, and federal and state laws provide powerful evidence that obstruction of justice as commonly understood, Descamps, 570 U.S., at 257, 133 S.Ct. 2276, when Congress enacted 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996, requires a pending investigation or proceeding.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,100,"In a feeble attempt to shore up its argument, the Court resorts to a seemingly limitless construction of relating to obstruction of justice, § 1101(a)(43)(S), according to which the phrase relating to covers all offenses that have `a connection with' obstruction of justice, ante, at 1841. That reading is a direct result of the Court's failure to consider statutory text and context when interpreting relating to. After all, in isolation that phrase is endlessly expansive because, absent a statute-specific  limiting principle, relations stop nowhere. Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 59-60, 133 S.Ct. 2191, 186 L.Ed.2d 275 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, one look at statutory text and context confirms that relating to must have a narrower meaning.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,101,"The text of the INA makes non-U. S. citizens removable based on the nature of their convictions, not based on their actual conduct. Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U.S., at 389, 137 S.Ct. 1562. This explains why, when applying § 1101(a)(43)(S), courts use the categorical approach, which compares the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic offense. Without a delineated generic offense, however, this comparison falters. The Court's nebulous reading of relating to obstruction of justice, perjury or subornation of perjury, or bribery of a witness, § 1101(a)(43)(S) (emphasis added), fails to grapple with this reality. Rather than ask whether a conviction is a categorical match for, say, generic perjury, the majority seems to suggest courts should ask if the conviction has a connection with generic perjury. If that is what the majority intends, it is not clear what that question means or how courts should go about answering it.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,102,"In contrast, no such problem arises if an offense relating to  perjury or an offense relating to obstruction of justice is understood narrowly to mean simply an offense qualifying as generic perjury or an offense qualifying as generic obstruction of justice. The broader statutory context confirms this reading. Again and again, § 1101(a)(43) uses the phrase relating to in descriptive parentheticals to introduce an ordinary language description of other aggravated felonies. For example, to identify the money laundering offenses in 18 U.S.C. § 1956, the INA refers to an offense described in section 1956 of title 18 (relating to laundering of money instruments). § 1101(a)(43)(D) (emphasis added). This structure, which the INA repeats well over a dozen times, see §§ 1101(a)(43)(D)-(E),(H)-(N), confirms that the phrase relating to is used in the INA simply to introduce (not expand upon) a general description of the intended crime category.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,103,"The Court's seemingly expansive reading of in relation to is also refuted by its consequences for the statutory text. If all that is required is a connection with something that obstructs the wheels of justice, ante, at 1840-1841, then the Government has open season to argue that all sorts of crimes that hinder law enforcement (e.g., failing to report a crime) or make detection of a crime more difficult (e.g., money laundering) qualify as offenses relating to obstruction of justice. On this approach, certain other aggravated felonies listed in the INA (e.g., § 1101(a)(43)(D) (money laundering)) will collapse into obstruction of justice, leading to substantial superfluity in the statute. Indeed, the separate categories of perjury and bribery of a witness listed in the very same subparagraph, § 1101(a)(43)(S), will themselves be part of that collapse.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,104,"More importantly, an expansive reading of in relation to opens the door for the Government to argue that many low-level offenses that fall outside of core obstruction of justice are aggravated felonies, even though the INA reserves that label for especially egregious felonies. Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U.S., at 394, 137 S.Ct. 1562. For example, misdemeanor convictions for failing to report a crime, presenting false identification to an officer, refusing to aid a police officer, leaving the scene of a crime, or purchasing a fake ID could be taken to count as relating to obstruction of justice. See Brief for National  Immigrant Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae 10-25 (collecting offenses).12",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,105,"This significant potential for redundancy, unfairness, and arbitrary enforcement should have led the Court to exercise interpretive restraint, Marinello v. United States, 584 U.

Indeed, the many problems with an expansive reading of relating to raise the question whether the Court even really intends to adopt such a reading, especially because the relevant discussion occupies a single paragraph. Perhaps instead the Court simply offers up connection with as a synonym for relating to, leaving it for lower courts to settle what that phrase actually means.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,107,"While the evidence assembled here is far stronger than any offered by the majority, the sheer complexity of the task at hand leaves lingering ambiguity, even if the Court claims it does not see it. Cf. ante, at 1843. To the extent doubts remain, however, they are resolved in favor of a narrower understanding of § 1101(a)(43)(S) by the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the non-U. S. citizen. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,108,"This Court resolves doubts in favor of the non-U. S. citizen in keeping with the general rule that ambiguities in penal statutes should be construed against the government. After all, deportation is not only a kind of penalty, but a drastic measure often the equivalent of banishment or exile. Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S. 6, 10, 68 S.Ct. 374, 92 L.Ed. 433 (1948). Nowhere is that truer than here. Aggravated felonies under the INA are a category of crimes singled out for the harshest deportation consequences. Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. 563, 566, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). If a non-U. S. citizen is convicted of an aggravated felony, even if she has a green card and has lived in this country for years, she is subject to removal and is also ineligible for readmission and many forms of immigration relief. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2), 1182(a)(9)(A), 1182(h), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3), 1229c(a)(1). Accordingly, removal is a virtually certainty for a non-U. S. citizen found to have an aggravated felony conviction, no matter how long he has previously resided here. Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct. 1204, 1210-1211, 200 L.Ed.2d 549 (2018). Moreover, a person convicted of an aggravated felony faces heighted criminal sanctions for disobeying orders of removal, § 1253(a)(1), or reentering the United States without permission, § 1326(b)(2). For example, the penalty for illegal reentry skyrockets from 2 years to 20. See §§ 1326(a), (b)(2).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,109,"This Court has been clear that, in the face of such stakes, it will not assume that Congress meant to trench on a non-U. S. citizen's freedom beyond that which is  required by the narrowest of several possible meanings of the words used. Fong Haw Tan, 333 U.S., at 10, 68 S.Ct. 374. While it may be true that certain broader readings of obstruction of justice are at least plausible, ante, at 1844 (JACKSON, J., concurring), that is not good enough because it is, at the very minimum, at least equally plausible that obstruction of justice requires a pending investigation or proceeding. The Court should have erred on the side of underinclusiveness when interpreting § 1101(a)(43). Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 205, 133 S.Ct. 1678.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,111,"By rejecting a central feature of core obstruction of justice and adopting a seemingly expansive reading of relating to, the Court leaves generic obstruction of justice without any discernible shape. The Court thus injects further chaos into the already fraught question of how to understand § 1101(a)(43)(S) and opens the door for the Government to try to use that provision as a catchall for all sorts of criminal activity, whether aggravated or not.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,112,"The Court could perhaps have reined in some of that chaos by giving obstruction of justice affirmative shape and boundaries in other ways, but it makes no effort to do so. Instead, the Court simply rejects the legal proposition that a pending investigation or proceeding is required for a predicate offense to qualify under § 1101(a)(43)(S). At bottom, its reasoning in support of that conclusion boils down to a simple syllogism, which it clothes in various guises: (1) Dissuading a witness from reporting a crime to the police qualifies as obstruction of justice, (2) the offense of dissuading a witness from reporting a crime does not require a pending investigation or proceeding, thus (3) some offense qualifying as obstruction of justice does not require a pending investigation or proceeding.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,113,"The flaw in this syllogism is, of course, premise (1). By assuming, up front and without reason, that dissuading a witness from reporting a crime qualifies as obstruction of justice, the Court oversteps. Congress could, if it wanted, add witness tampering to the INA's lengthy list of aggravated felonies, just as it did with the list of offenses at § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii), but it has not done so. The Court's decision today makes that judgment call for Congress. Our license to interpret statutes does not include the power to engage in such freewheeling judicial policymaking. Pereida v. Wilkinson, 592 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 754, 767, 209 L.Ed.2d 47 (2021).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-052,114,"The syllogism's conclusion is also noteworthy for its narrowness. In the end, all the Court really holds is that generic obstruction of justice includes one offense (dissuading a witness from reporting a crime) that does not require a pending investigation or proceeding. Lower courts faced with difficult questions about what offenses qualify as categorical matches for § 1101(a)(43)(S) would do well to bear in mind the limited nature of that holding. Many open questions remain regarding whether offenses other than dissuading a witness from reporting a crime are categorical matches for § 1101(a)(43)(S), what affirmative understanding of § 1101(a)(43)(S) should guide that categorical analysis, and whether other offenses that also lack a connection to a pending investigation or proceeding can qualify under that analysis.13 I do not take  the majority to be addressing any of these questions, and great care is warranted in answering them in the future.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

In 2013, USPS entered into an agreement with Amazon to begin facilitating Sunday deliveries, and in 2016, USPS signed a memorandum of understanding with the relevant union (the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association) that set out how Sunday and holiday parcel delivery would be handled. During a 2-month peak season, each post office would use its own staff to deliver packages. At all other times, Sunday and holiday deliveries would be carried out by employees (including Rural Carrier Associates like Groff) working from a regional hub. For Quarryville, Pennsylvania, where Groff was originally stationed, the regional hub was the Lancaster Annex.",Alito,0,
2022-053,37,"The memorandum specifies the order in which USPS employees are to be called on for Sunday work outside the peak season. First in line are each hub's Assistant Rural Carriers— part-time employees who are assigned to the hub and cover only Sundays and holidays. Second are any volunteers from the geographic area, who are assigned on a rotating basis. And third are all other carriers, who are compelled to do the work on a rotating basis. Groff fell into this third category, and after the memorandum of understanding was adopted, he was told that he would be required to work on Sunday. He then sought and received a transfer to Holtwood, a small rural USPS station that had only seven employees and that, at the time, did not make Sunday deliveries. But in March 2017, Amazon deliveries began there as well.",Alito,0,
2022-053,38,"With Groff unwilling to work on Sundays, USPS made other arrangements. During the peak season, Sunday deliveries that would have otherwise been performed by Groff were carried out by the rest of the Holtwood staff, including the postmaster, whose job ordinarily does not involve delivering mail. During other months, Groff's Sunday assignments were redistributed to other carriers assigned to the regional hub.1 Throughout this time, Groff  continued to receive progressive discipline for failing to work on Sundays. 35 F.4th 162, 166 (C.A.3 2022). Finally, in January 2019, he resigned.2",Alito,0,

The District Court granted summary judgment to USPS, 2021 WL 1264030 (ED Pa., Apr. 6, 2021), and the Third Circuit affirmed. The panel majority felt that it was bound by the ruling in Hardison, which it construed to mean that requiring an employer `to bear more than a de minimis cost' to provide a religious accommodation is an undue hardship. 35 F.4th at 174, n. 18 (quoting 432 U.S. at 84, 97 S.Ct. 2264). Under Circuit precedent, the panel observed, this was not a difficult threshold to pass, 35 F.4th at 174 (internal quotation marks omitted), and it held that this low standard was met in this case. Exempting Groff from Sunday work, the panel found, had imposed on his coworkers, disrupted the workplace and workflow, and diminished employee morale. Id., at 175. Judge Hardiman dissented, concluding that adverse effects on USPS employees in Lancaster or Holtwood did not alone suffice to show the needed hardship on the employer's business.

As originally enacted, Title VII did not spell out what it meant by discrimination because of  religion, but shortly after the statute's passage, the EEOC interpreted that provision to mean that employers were sometimes required to accommodate the reasonable religious needs of employees. 29 C.F.R. § 1605.1(a)(2) (1967). After some tinkering, the EEOC settled on a formulation that obligated employers to make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of  employees whenever that would not work an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. 29 C.F.R. § 1605.1 (1968).",Alito,0,
2022-053,45,"Between 1968 and 1972, the EEOC elaborated on its understanding of undue hardship in a long line of decisions addressing a variety of policies.

2022-053,46,"EEOC decisions did not settle the question of undue hardship. In 1970, the Sixth Circuit held (in a Sabbath case) that Title VII as then written did not require an employer to accede to or accommodate religious practice because that would raise grave Establishment Clause questions. Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 429 F.2d 324, 334. This Court granted certiorari, 400 U.S. 1008, 91 S.Ct. 566, 27 L.Ed.2d 621, but then affirmed by an evenly divided vote, 402 U.S. 689, 91 S.Ct. 2186, 29 L.Ed.2d 267 (1971).",Alito,0,

The Stores Department was responsible for providing parts needed to repair and maintain aircraft. Hardison v.",Alito,0,

After taking this job, Hardison underwent a religious conversion. He began to observe the Sabbath by absenting himself from work from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, and this conflicted with his work schedule. The problem was solved for a time when Hardison, who worked in Building 1, switched to the night shift, but it resurfaced when he sought and obtained a transfer to the day shift in Building 2 so that he could spend evenings with his wife. 375 F.Supp. at 889. In that new building, he did not have enough seniority to avoid work during his Sabbath. Attempts at accommodation failed, and he was eventually discharged on grounds of insubordination. 432 U.S. at 69, 97 S.Ct. 2264.",Alito,0,

2022-053,52,"Both TWA and IAM then filed petitions for certiorari, with TWA's lead petition asking this Court to decide whether the 1972 amendment of Title VII violated the Establishment Clause as applied in the decision below, particularly insofar as that decision had approved an accommodation that allegedly overrode seniority rights granted by the relevant collective bargaining agreement.6 The Court granted both petitions. 429 U. S. 958, 97 S.Ct. 381, 50 L.Ed.2d 325 (1976).",Alito,0,
2022-053,53,"When the Court took that action, all counsel had good reason to expect that the Establishment Clause would figure prominently in the Court's analysis. As noted above, in June 1971, the Court, by an equally divided vote, had affirmed the Sixth Circuit's decision in Dewey, which had heavily relied on Establishment Clause avoidance to reject the interpretation of Title VII set out in the EEOC's reasonable-accommodation guidelines. Just over three weeks later, the Court had handed down its (now abrogated)7 decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) which adopted a test under which any law whose principal or primary effect was to advance religion was unconstitutional. Id., at 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105. Because it could be argued that granting a special accommodation to a religious practice had just such a purpose and effect, some thought that Lemon posed a serious problem for the 1972 amendment of Title VII. And shortly before review was granted in Hardison, the Court had announced that the Justices were evenly divided in a case that challenged the 1972 amendment as a violation of the Establishment Clause. Parker Seal Co. v. Cummins, 429 U.S. 65, 97 S.Ct. 342, 50 L.Ed.2d 223 (1976) (per curiam).",Alito,0,
2022-053,54,"Against this backdrop, both TWA and IAM challenged the constitutionality of requiring any accommodation for religious practice.

Brief for Petitioner TWA in O. T. 1976, No. 75-1126, p. 19. Applying the three-part Lemon test, TWA argued that any such accommodation has the primary purpose and effect of advancing religion and entails pervasive government entanglement in religious issues. Brief for Petitioner TWA in No. 75-1126, at 20. The union's brief made a similar argument, Brief for Petitioner IAM, O. T. 1976, No. 75-1126, pp. 21-24, 50-72, but stressed the special status of seniority rights under Title VII, id., at 24-36.",Alito,0,
2022-053,55,"Despite the prominence of the Establishment Clause in the briefs submitted by the parties and their amici,8 constitutional concerns played no on-stage role in the Court's opinion, which focused instead on seniority rights.9 The opinion stated that the principal issue on which TWA and the union came to this Court was whether Title VII requires an employer and a union who have agreed on a seniority system to deprive senior employees of their seniority rights in order to accommodate a junior employee's religious practices. 432 U.S. at 83, and n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264. The Court held that Title VII imposed no such requirement. Ibid. This conclusion, the Court found, was supported by the fact that seniority systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII itself. Id., at 81, 97 S.Ct. 2264. It noted that Title VII expressly provides special protection for `bona fide seniority  systems,' id., at 81-82, 97 S.Ct. 2264 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h)), and it cited precedent reading the statute `to make clear that the routine application of a bona fide seniority system is not  unlawful under Title VII.' 432 U.S. at 82, 97 S.Ct. 2264 (quoting Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 352, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977)). Invoking these authorities,  the Court found that the statute did not require an accommodation that involuntarily deprived employees of seniority rights. 432 U.S. at 80, 97 S.Ct. 2264.10",Alito,0,
2022-053,56,"Applying this interpretation of Title VII and disagreeing with the Eighth Circuit's evaluation of the factual record, the Court identified no way in which TWA, without violating seniority rights, could have feasibly accommodated Hardison's request for an exemption from work on his Sabbath. The Court found that not enough co-workers were willing to take Hardison's shift voluntarily, that compelling them to do so would have violated their seniority rights, and that leaving the Stores Department short-handed would have adversely affected its essential mission. Id., at 68, 80, 97 S.Ct. 2264.",Alito,0,
2022-053,57,"The Court also rejected two other options offered in Justice Marshall's dissent: (1) paying other workers overtime wages to induce them to work on Saturdays and making up for that increased cost by requiring Hardison to work overtime for regular wages at other times and (2) forcing TWA to pay overtime for Saturday work for three months, after which, the dissent thought, Hardison could transfer back to the night shift in Building 1. The Court dismissed both of these options as not feasible, id., at 83, n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264, but it provided no explanation for its evaluation of the first. In dissent, Justice Marshall suggested one possible reason: that the collective bargaining agreement might have disallowed Hardison's working overtime for regular wages. Id., at 95, 97 S.Ct. 2264 (dissenting opinion). But the majority did not embrace that explanation.",Alito,0,
2022-053,58,"As for the second, the Court disputed the dissent's conclusion that Hardison, if he moved back to Building 1, would have had enough seniority to choose to work the night shift. Id., at 83, n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264. That latter disagreement was key. The dissent thought that Hardison could have resumed the night shift in Building 1 after just three months, and it therefore calculated what it would have cost TWA to pay other workers' overtime wages on Saturdays for that finite period of time. According to that calculation, TWA's added expense for three months would have been $150 (about $1,250 in 2022 dollars).11 Id., at 92, n. 6, 97 S.Ct. 2264. But the Court doubted that Hardison could have regained the seniority rights he had enjoyed in Building 1 prior to his transfer, and if that were true, TWA would have been required to pay other workers overtime for Saturday work indefinitely. Even under Justice Marshall's math, that would have worked out to $600 per year at the time, or roughly $5,000 per year today.",Alito,0,
2022-053,59,"In the briefs and at argument, little space was devoted to the question of determining when increased costs amount to an undue hardship under the statute, but a single, but oft-quoted, sentence in the opinion of the Court, if taken literally, suggested that even a pittance might be too much for an employer to be forced to endure. The line read as follows: To require TWA to bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give Hardison Saturdays off is an undue hardship. Id., at 84, 97 S.Ct. 2264.",Alito,0,
2022-053,60,"Although this line would later be viewed by many lower courts as the authoritative  interpretation of the statutory term undue hardship, it is doubtful that it was meant to take on that large role. In responding to Justice Marshall's dissent, the Court described the governing standard quite differently, stating three times that an accommodation is not required when it entails substantial costs or expenditures. Id., at 83, n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264. This formulation suggests that an employer may be required to bear costs and make expenditures that are not substantial. Of course, there is a big difference between costs and expenditures that are not substantial and those that are de minimis, which is to say, so very small or trifling that that they are not even worth noticing. Black's Law Dictionary 388 (5th ed. 1979).",Alito,0,
2022-053,61,"The Court's response to Justice Marshall's estimate of the extra costs that TWA would have been required to foot is also telling. The majority did not argue that Justice Marshall's math produced considerably more than a de minimis cost (as it certainly did). Instead, the Court responded that Justice Marshall's calculation involved assumptions that were not feasible under the circumstances and would have produced a different conflict with the seniority rights of other employees. 432 U.S. at 83, n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264, see Brief for United States 29, n. 4 (noting that Hardison specifically rejected the dissent's calculations and that it is wrong to assert that Hardison held that a $150 cost was an undue hardship).",Alito,0,
2022-053,62,"Ultimately, then, it is not clear that any of the possible accommodations would have actually solved Hardison's problem without transgressing seniority rights. The Hardison Court was very clear that those rights were off-limits. Its guidance on undue hardship in situations not involving seniority rights is much less clear.",Alito,0,
2022-053,64,"Even though Hardison's reference to de minimis was undercut by conflicting language and was fleeting in comparison to its discussion of the principal issue of seniority rights, lower courts have latched on to de minimis as the governing standard.",Alito,0,
2022-053,65,"To be sure, as the Solicitor General notes, some lower courts have understood that the protection for religious adherents is greater than more than  de minimis might suggest when read in isolation. But a bevy of diverse religious organizations has told this Court that the de minimis test has blessed the denial of even minor accommodation in many cases, making it harder for members of minority faiths to enter the job market. See, e.g., Brief for The Sikh Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 15, 19-20 (the de minimis standard eliminates any meaningful mandate to accommodate Sikh practices in the workplace and emboldens employers to deny reasonable accommodation requests), Brief for Council on American-Islamic Relations as Amicus Curiae 3 (Muslim women wearing religiously mandated attire have lost employment opportunities and have been excluded from critical public institutions like public schools, law enforcement agencies, and youth rehabilitation centers), Brief for Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America as Amicus Curiae 14-15 (because the de minimis cost test can be satisfied in nearly any circumstance, Orthodox Jews once again are left at the mercy of their employers' good graces), Brief for Seventh-day Adventist Church in Canada et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (joint brief of Sabbatarian faiths arguing that Sabbath accommodation under the de minimis standard is left to their employers' and coworkers' goodwill).",Alito,0,
2022-053,66,"The EEOC has also accepted Hardison as prescribing a `more than a de minimis cost' test, 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(e)(1) (2022), but has tried in some ways to soften its impact. It has specifically cautioned (as has the Solicitor General in this case) against extending the phrase to cover such things as the administrative costs involved in reworking schedules, the infrequent or temporary payment of premium wages for a substitute, and voluntary substitutes and swaps when they are not contrary to a bona fide seniority system. §§ 1605.2(e)(1), (2).",Alito,0,
2022-053,67,"Nevertheless, some courts have rejected even the EEOC's gloss on de minimis.12 And in other cases, courts have rejected accommodations that the EEOC's guidelines consider to be ordinarily required, such as the relaxation of dress codes and coverage for occasional absences.13 Members of this Court have warned that, if the de minimis rule represents the holding of Hardison, the decision might have to be reconsidered. Small v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water, 593 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 1227, 209 L.Ed.2d 538 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), Patterson v. Walgreen Co., 589 U. S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 685, 206 L.Ed.2d 230 (2020) (ALITO, J., concurring in denial of certiorari). Four years ago, the Solicitor General— joined on its brief by the EEOC—likewise took that view. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Patterson v. Walgreen Co., O. T. 2019, No. 18349, p. 20 (Contrary to Hardison, therefore, an `undue hardship' is not best interpreted to mean `more than a de minimis cost').",Alito,0,
2022-053,68,"Today, the Solicitor General disavows its prior position that Hardison should be overruled—but only on the understanding that Hardison does not compel courts to read the more than de minimis standard literally or in a manner that undermines Hardison's references to substantial cost.14 Tr. of Oral Arg. 107. With the benefit  of comprehensive briefing and oral argument, we agree.15",Alito,0,
2022-053,70,"We hold that showing more than a de minimis cost, as that phrase is used in common parlance, does not suffice to establish undue hardship under Title VII. Hardison cannot be reduced to that one phrase. In describing an employer's undue hardship defense, Hardison referred repeatedly to substantial burdens, and that formulation better explains the decision. We therefore, like the parties, understand Hardison to mean that undue hardship is shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context of an employer's business. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 61-62 (argument of Solicitor General). This fact-specific inquiry comports with both Hardison and the meaning of undue hardship in ordinary speech.",Alito,0,
2022-053,72,"As we have explained, we do not write on a blank slate in determining what an employer must prove to defend a denial of a religious accommodation, but we think it reasonable to begin with Title VII's text. After all, as we have stressed over and over again in recent years, statutory interpretation must begin with, and ultimately heed, what a statute actually says. National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 U. S. 109, ___, 138 S.Ct. 617, 631, 199 L.Ed.2d 501 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted), see Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 74, 143 S.Ct. 665, 214 L.Ed.2d 434 (2023), Intel Corp. Investment Policy Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 768, 775-776, 777-778, 206 L.Ed.2d 103 (2020). Here, the key statutory term is undue hardship. In common parlance, a hardship is, at a minimum, something hard to bear. Random House Dictionary of the English Language 646 (1966) (Random House). Other definitions go further. See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1033 (1971) (Webster's Third) (something that causes or entails suffering or privation), American Heritage Dictionary 601 (1969) (American Heritage) (extreme privation, adversity, suffering), Black's Law Dictionary, at 646 (privation, suffering, adversity). But under any definition, a hardship is more severe than a mere burden. So even if Title VII said only that an employer need not be made to suffer a hardship, an employer could not escape liability simply by showing that an accommodation would impose some sort of additional costs. Those costs would have to rise to the level of hardship, and adding the modifier undue means that the requisite burden, privation, or adversity must rise to an excessive or unjustifiable level. Random House 1547, see, e.g., Webster's Third 2492 (inappropriate, unsuited, or exceeding or violating propriety or fitness), American Heritage 1398 (excessive). The Government agrees, noting that `undue hardship means something greater than hardship.' Brief for United States 30, see id., at 39 (arguing that accommodations should be assessed while `keeping in mind both words in the key phrase of the actual statutory text: undue and hardship'  (quoting Adeyeye v.

Black's Law Dictionary, at 388. So considering ordinary meaning while taking Hardison as a given, we are pointed toward something closer to Hardison's references to substantial additional costs or substantial expenditures. 432 U.S. at 83, n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264.",Alito,0,
2022-053,74,"Similarly, while we do not rely on the pre-1972 EEOC decisions described above to define the term, we do observe that these decisions often found that accommodations that entailed substantial costs were required. See supra, at 2287-2288, nn. 3-4. Nothing in this history plausibly suggests that undue hardship in Title VII should be read to mean anything less than its meaning in ordinary use. Cf. George v. McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1953, 1959, 213 L.Ed.2d 265 (2022) (a robust regulatory backdrop can fill in the details of a statutory scheme's use of a specific term).",Alito,0,
2022-053,75,"In short, no factor discussed by the parties —the ordinary meaning of undue hardship, the EEOC guidelines that Hardison concluded that the 1972 amendment `ratified,' 432 U.S. at 76, n. 11, 97 S.Ct. 2264 (internal quotation marks omitted), the use of that term by the EEOC prior to those amendments, and the common use of that term in other statutes—supports reducing Hardison to its more than a de minimis cost line.

We have no reservations in saying that a good deal of the EEOC's guidance in this area is sensible and will, in all likelihood, be unaffected by our clarifying decision today. After all, as a public advocate for employee rights, much of the EEOC's guidance has focused on what should be accommodated. Accordingly, today's clarification may prompt little, if any, change in the agency's guidance explaining why no undue hardship is imposed by temporary costs, voluntary shift swapping, occasional shift swapping, or administrative costs. See 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(d). But it would not be prudent to ratify in toto a body of EEOC interpretation that has not had the benefit of the clarification we adopt today. What is most important is that undue hardship in Title VII means what it says, and courts should resolve whether a hardship would be substantial in the context of an employer's business in the commonsense manner that it would use in applying any such test.",Alito,0,
2022-053,83,"The erroneous de minimis interpretation of Hardison may have had the effect of leading courts to pay insufficient attention to what the actual text of Title VII means with regard to several recurring issues.

2022-053,84,"First, on the second question presented, both parties agree that the language of Title VII requires an assessment of a possible accommodation's effect on the conduct of the employer's business. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j), see 35 F.4th at 177-178 (Hardiman, J., dissenting). As the Solicitor General put it, not all impacts on coworkers  are relevant, but only coworker impacts that go on to affect the conduct of the business. Tr. of Oral Arg. 102-104. So an accommodation's effect on co-workers may have ramifications for the conduct of the employer's business, but a court cannot stop its analysis without examining whether that further logical step is shown in a particular case.",Alito,0,
2022-053,85,"On this point, the Solicitor General took pains to clarify that some evidence that occasionally is used to show impacts on coworkers is off the table for consideration. Id., at 102. Specifically, a coworker's dislike of religious practice and expression in the workplace or the mere fact of an accommodation is not cognizable to factor into the undue hardship inquiry. Id., at 89-90. To the extent that this was not previously clear, we agree. An employer who fails to provide an accommodation has a defense only if the hardship is undue, and a hardship that is attributable to employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in general, or to the very notion of accommodating religious practice cannot be considered undue. If bias or hostility to a religious practice or a religious accommodation provided a defense to a reasonable accommodation claim, Title VII would be at war with itself. See id., at 89 (argument of Solicitor General) (such an approach would be giving effect to religious hostility), contra, EEOC v. Sambo's of Georgia, Inc., 530 F.Supp. 86, 89 (ND Ga. 1981) (considering as hardship adverse customer reaction from a simple aversion to, or discomfort in dealing with, bearded people).",Alito,0,
2022-053,86,"Second, as the Solicitor General's authorities underscore, Title VII requires that an employer reasonably accommodate an employee's practice of religion, not merely that it assess the reasonableness of a particular possible accommodation or accommodations. See Adeyeye, 721 F.3d at 455, see also Brief for United  States 30, 33, 39. This distinction matters. Faced with an accommodation request like Groff's, it would not be enough for an employer to conclude that forcing other employees to work overtime would constitute an undue hardship. Consideration of other options, such as voluntary shift swapping, would also be necessary.",Alito,0,
2022-053,88,"Having clarified the Title VII undue-hardship standard, we think it appropriate to leave the context-specific application of that clarified standard to the lower courts in the first instance. The Third Circuit assumed that Hardison prescribed a more than a de minimis cost test, 35 F.4th at 175, and this may have led the court to dismiss a number of possible accommodations, including those involving the cost of incentive pay, or the administrative costs of coordination with other nearby stations with a broader set of employees. Without foreclosing the possibility that USPS will prevail, we think it appropriate to leave it to the lower courts to apply our clarified context-specific standard, and to decide whether any further factual development is needed.* * *",Alito,0,

An employer violates Title VII if it fails to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious observance or practice, unless the employer demonstrates that accommodation would result in undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). The statutory standard is undue hardship, not trivial cost.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-053,93,"Hardison, however, cannot be reduced to its de minimis language. Instead, that case must be understood in light of its facts and the Court's reasoning. The Hardison Court concluded that the plaintiff's proposed accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business because the accommodation would have required the employer either to deprive other employees of their seniority rights under a collective-bargaining agreement, or to incur substantial additional costs in the form of lost efficiency or higher wages. 432 U.S. at 79-81, 83-84, and n. 14, 97 S.Ct. 2264. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has interpreted Title VII's undue-hardship standard in this way for seven consecutive Presidential administrations, from President Reagan to President Biden. See 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2(e) (2022) (citing Hardison, 432 U.S. at 80, 84, 97 S.Ct. 2264).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-053,94,"Petitioner Gerald Groff asks this Court to overrule Hardison and to replace it with a significant difficulty or expense standard. Brief for Petitioner 17-38. The Court does not do so. That is a wise choice because stare decisis has enhanced force in statutory cases. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 456, 135 S.Ct. 2401, 192 L.Ed.2d 463 (2015). Congress is free to revise this Court's statutory interpretations. The Court's respect for Congress's decision not to intervene promotes the separation of powers by requiring interested parties to resort to the legislative rather than the judicial process to achieve their policy goals. This justification for statutory stare decisis is especially  strong here because Congress has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse Hardison—openings as frequent and clear as this Court ever sees. Id., at 456-457, 135 S.Ct. 2401.1 Moreover, in the decades since Hardison was decided, Congress has revised Title VII multiple times in response to other decisions of this Court,2 yet never in response to Hardison. See Kimble, 576 U.S. at 457, 135 S.Ct. 2401.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-053,95,"Groff also asks the Court to decide that Title VII requires the United States Postal Service to show undue hardship to its business, not to Groff's co-workers. Brief for Petitioner 42 (emphasis added), see 35 F.4th 162, 176 (C.A.3 2022) (Hardiman, J., dissenting). The Court, however, recognizes that Title VII requires undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j) (emphasis added). Because the conduct of a business plainly includes the management and performance of the business's employees, undue hardship on the conduct of a business may include undue hardship on the business's employees. See, e.g., Hardison, 432 U.S. at 79-81, 97 S.Ct. 2264 (deprivation of employees' bargained-for seniority rights constitutes undue hardship). There is no basis in the text of the statute, let alone in economics or common sense, to conclude otherwise. Indeed, for many businesses, labor is more important to the conduct of the business than any other factor.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-053,96,"To be sure, some effects on co-workers will not constitute undue hardship under Title VII. For example, animus toward a protected group is not a cognizable hardship under any antidiscrimination statute. Cf. ante, at 2296-2297. In addition, some hardships, such as the labor costs of coordinating voluntary shift swaps, are not undue because they are too insubstantial. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1605.2(d)(1)(i), (e)(1). Nevertheless, if there is an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j), then such hardship is sufficient, even if it consists of hardship on employees. With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-054,30,"The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability on anyone who knowingly submits a false claim to the Government. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a). In some cases, that rule  is straightforward: If a law authorized payment of $100 for each medical test, and a doctor knows that he did five tests but submits a claim for ten, then he has knowingly submitted a false claim. But sometimes the rule is less clear. If a law authorized payment for only customary medical tests, some doctors might be confused when it came time for billing. And, while some doctors might honestly mistake what that term means, others might correctly understand whatever customary meant in this context—and submit claims that were inaccurate anyway.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,31,"The cases before us today involve a legal standard similar to that latter example: In certain circumstances, pharmacies are required to bill Medicare and Medicaid for their usual and customary drug prices. And, critically, these cases involve defendants (respondents here) who may have correctly understood the relevant standard and submitted inaccurate claims anyway. The question presented is thus whether respondents could have the scienter required by the FCA if they correctly understood that standard and thought that their claims were inaccurate.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,32,"We hold that the answer is yes: What matters for an FCA case is whether the defendant knew the claim was false. Thus, if respondents correctly interpreted the relevant phrase and believed their claims were false, then they could have known their claims were false.",Thomas,0,

In No. 21-1326, respondents are a group of companies that we collectively call SuperValu, in No. 22-111, respondent is Safeway, Inc.

2022-054,37,"As relevant here, States' Medicaid plans may offer outpatient prescription-drug coverage to qualifying individuals. § 1396d(a)(12). However, the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has promulgated regulations that limit the amount these programs may reimburse for certain drugs. See 42 C.F.R. § 447.512(b)(2) (2021). Those regulations limit any reimbursement to the lower of two amounts, one of which is the healthcare provider's usual and customary charges for the drug to the general public. Ibid. State Medicaid agencies likewise typically reimburse pharmacies for the lowest of different amounts, one of which is often the pharmacy's usual and customary charge to the public. See CMS, Medicaid Covered Outpatient Prescription Drug Reimbursement Information by State, Quarter Ending September 2022 (Nov. 16, 2022), https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-prescription-drug-resources/medicaid-covered-outpatient-prescription-drug-reimbursement-information-state/index.html.",Thomas,0,

Those plan sponsors, in turn, enter contracts with pharmacies (sometimes through middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers). Many of the contracts at issue here limited any reimbursement to the pharmacy's usual and customary price.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,39,"The bottom line is that, when respondents submitted reimbursement claims to these entities, they often were required to charge and disclose their usual and customary price for that drug.1 But, according to petitioners, respondents reported higher prices to these entities than the ones that they usually and customarily charged to the public.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,41,"According to petitioners, in 2006, respondents' competitor, Walmart, began offering 30-day supplies of many drugs for $4.2 To compete with Walmart, SuperValu and Safeway adopted price-match programs in which their pharmacies would match a competitor's lower price at a customer's request. SuperValu's pharmacies would then automatically apply that price to future refills of the drug for those customers. Meanwhile, Safeway also adopted a membership discount program through which customers received discounted generic drug prices (often $4 for a 30-day supply). To enroll in that membership program, customers had to fill out a form with only basic information, petitioners argue that Safeway often already had this information on file. SuperValu's programs continued until 2016, Safeway's continued until 2015.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,42,"Respondents' discount programs turned out to be popular. Though the exact extent of that popularity is disputed, petitioners have presented evidence that the discounted prices comprised a majority of sales for many drugs to customers who paid in cash (and not through insurance) for at least some years during the programs' operation. For example, according to petitioners, a majority of SuperValu's 2012 cash sales for 44 of its 50 top-selling prescription drugs were made at those discounted prices. And, according to petitioners, 88% of Safeway's 2014 cash sales for its top 20 generic drugs were at discounted rates.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,43,"Petitioners contend that those discounted prices were actually respondents' usual and customary prices—and that, rather than submitting those lower prices for reimbursement, respondents instead reported their higher, non-discounted prices. For example, petitioners have presented evidence that Safeway charged just $10 for 94% of its cash sales for a 90-day supply of a cholesterol drug between 2008 and 2012. Yet Safeway apparently reported prices as high as $108 as usual and customary during that time. And petitioners presented evidence that, at least at some times  and for some drugs, SuperValu made more than 80% of its cash sales for prices less than what it disclosed as its usual and customary price.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,44,"To be sure, the phrase usual and customary on its face appears somewhat open to interpretation. But petitioners contend that respondents were informed that their lower, discounted prices were their usual and customary prices, believed their discounted prices were their usual and customary prices, and tried to hide their discounted prices from regulators and contractors. Petitioners have presented evidence that they claim supports that theory. For example, both SuperValu and Safeway received a notice in 2006 from a pharmacy benefit manager stating that the phrase usual and customary refers to discounted prices, Safeway apparently received the same message from state Medicaid agencies. And executives at both companies raised concerns about letting state agencies or pharmacy benefit managers find out about their discounted prices.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,45,"For example, some emails between SuperValu executives described their discount program as a stealthy approach and noted concern for the integrity of their U&C price claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21-1326, p. 67a (internal quotation marks omitted). An executive at Safeway similarly stated that we may have some issues with U&C and that if you match a price offer, that becomes your usual and customary price for that day. 30 F.4th 649, 667 (CA7 2022) (internal quotation marks omitted). Other documents directed Safeway's employees to match Walmart prices, but cautioned that employees should not put any of this in writing to stores because our official policy is we do not match. Id., at 666. Petitioners argue that this and other evidence show that respondents thought that their claims were inaccurate yet submitted them anyway.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,47,"Before proceeding, some context about how these cases reached us is useful to understand the question presented. The FCA (as relevant here) imposes liability on those who knowingly present  a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval. § 3729(a)(1)(A). Thus, two essential elements of an FCA violation are (1) the falsity of the claim and (2) the defendant's knowledge of the claim's falsity.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,48,"In SuperValu's case, the District Court ruled against SuperValu on the falsity element —it determined that SuperValu's discounted prices were its usual and customary prices and that, by not reporting them, SuperValu submitted claims that were false. But, the District Court then granted summary judgment for SuperValu based on the scienter element, holding SuperValu could not have acted knowingly. Soon after, it granted Safeway summary judgment on the same basis.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,49,"The Seventh Circuit affirmed. 9 F.4th 455 (2021). In doing so, it relied heavily on Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 2201, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2007)—a case that interpreted the term `willfully' in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), id., at 52, 127 S.Ct. 2201. Specifically, the Seventh Circuit read Safeco to dictate a two-step inquiry for ascertaining whether a defendant acted recklessly or knowingly. At step one, the Seventh Circuit took Safeco to ask whether a defendant's acts were consistent with any objectively reasonable interpretation of the relevant law that had not been ruled out by definitive legal authority or guidance. This step, the Seventh Circuit held, applied regardless of whether the defendant actually believed such an interpretation at the time of its claims. Only if  the defendant's acts were not consistent with any objectively reasonable interpretation would the court proceed, at step two, to consider the defendant's actual subjective thoughts. Thus, under the Seventh Circuit's approach, a claim would have to be objectively unreasonable, as a legal matter, before a defendant could be held liable for knowingly submitting a false claim, no matter what the defendant thought.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,50,"Turning to the facts here, the Seventh Circuit held that respondents were entitled to summary judgment because their actions were consistent with an objectively reasonable interpretation of the phrase usual and customary. Specifically, the court reasoned that the phrase could have been understood as referring to respondents' retail prices, not their discounted prices—even if the phrase, correctly understood, referred to their discounted prices. It thus did not matter whether respondents thought that their discounted prices were actually their usual and customary prices. What mattered, instead, was that someone else, standing in respondents' shoes, may have reasonably thought that the retail prices were what counted.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,51,"We granted certiorari, see 598 U. S. ___, 143 S.Ct. 644, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023), to resolve that legal question: If respondents' claims were false and they actually thought that their claims were false—because they believed that their reported prices were not actually their usual and customary prices—then would they have knowingly submitted a false claim within the FCA's meaning? Or is the Seventh Circuit correct—that respondents could not have knowingly submitted a false claim unless no hypothetical, reasonable person could have thought that their reported prices were their usual and customary prices?",Thomas,0,
2022-054,52,"It is equally important to recognize what we did not grant certiorari to review: We are not reviewing the meaning of the phrase usual and customary or whether any of respondents' claims were, in fact, inaccurate or otherwise false. Nor are we reviewing whether respondents actually thought that the phrase usual and customary referred to their discounted prices. Nor, for that matter, are we reviewing any factual disputes about what respondents did or did not believe or do. These cases come to us from the grant of summary judgment to respondents on one discrete legal issue, and we granted certiorari to resolve only that issue.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,54,"Based on the FCA's statutory text and its common-law roots, the answer to the question presented is straightforward: The FCA's scienter element refers to respondents' knowledge and subjective beliefs —not to what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed. And, even though the phrase usual and customary may be ambiguous on its face, such facial ambiguity alone is not sufficient to preclude a finding that respondents knew their claims were false.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,56,"We start, as always, with the text of the FCA. See Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 187, 136 S.Ct. 1989, 195 L.Ed.2d 348 (2016). Here, the FCA defines the term knowingly as encompassing three mental states: First, that the person has actual knowledge of the information, § 3729(b)(1)(A)(i). Second, that the person acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information, § 3729(b)(1)(A)(ii). And, third, that the person acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information,  § 3729(b)(1)(A)(iii). In short, either actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or recklessness will suffice.3",Thomas,0,
2022-054,57,"That three-part test largely tracks the traditional common-law scienter requirement for claims of fraud. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526 (1976), Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm § 10 (2018). For example, one widely cited English decision, Derry v. Peek, 1889 14 App. Cas., articulated the rule as follows: Fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Id., at 374 (judgment of Lord Herschell). And, capturing the FCA's use of the term deliberate ignorance, that decision noted that an action for fraud would lie if a person making a false statement had shut his eyes to the facts, or purposely abstained from inquiring into them. Id., at 376. Those standards have been cited and widely adopted by American courts in the century since. See 3 D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, & E. Bublick, Law of Torts § 665, p. 645 (2d ed. 2011) (Dobbs), Restatement (Second) of Torts, App. § 526, Reporter's Note.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,58,"That the text of the FCA tracks the common law is unsurprising because, as we have recognized, the FCA is largely a fraud statute. See Escobar, 579 U.S., at 187-188, and n. 2, 136 S.Ct. 1989. Indeed, the FCA was first enacted in 1863 to `stop the massive frauds perpetrated by large contractors during the Civil War.' Id., at 181, 136 S.Ct. 1989. To this day, the FCA refers to `false or fraudulent' claims, pointing directly to the common-law meaning of fraud. Id., at 187, 136 S.Ct. 1989 (emphasis added). In the absence of statutory text to the contrary, we would assume that `Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning' of such a common-law term. See ibid. And here, the FCA's definition of knowingly confirms that assumption by largely tracking the common-law scienter standards for fraud.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,59,"On their face and at common law, the FCA's standards focus primarily on what respondents thought and believed. First, the term actual knowledge refers to whether a person is aware of information.4 See Intel Corp. Investment Policy Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct. 768, 776-777, 206 L.Ed.2d 103 (2020), Escobar, 579 U.S., at 191, 136 S.Ct. 1989 (A defendant can have `actual knowledge' that a condition is material without the Government expressly calling it a condition of payment), Black's Law Dictionary 784 (5th ed. 1979) (to understand, or the perception of the truth), Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526, and Comment c. Second, the term deliberate ignorance encompasses defendants who are aware of a substantial risk that their statements are false, but intentionally avoid taking steps to confirm the statement's truth or falsity. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 563 U.S. 754, 769, 131 S.Ct. 2060, 179 L.Ed.2d 1167 (2011), Black's Law Dictionary, at 672 (voluntary ignorance), Derry, 14 App. Cas., at 376. And, third, the term reckless  disregard similarly captures defendants who are conscious of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that their claims are false, but submit the claims anyway. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 1142, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 836, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), Restatement (Third) of Torts § 10, Comment c.5",Thomas,0,
2022-054,60,"Again, that tracks traditional common-law fraud, which ordinarily depends on a subjective test and the defendant's culpable state of mind. Id., § 10, Comment a. What typically matters at common law is whether the defendant made the false statement without belief in its truth or recklessly, careless of whether it is true or false. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526, Comment e. If a defendant knows that he lacks an honest belief in the statement's truth, that is often enough to establish scienter for fraud. Id., Comment d., Dobbs § 665, at 647.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,61,"Both the text and the common law also point to what the defendant thought when submitting the false claim—not what the defendant may have thought after submitting it. As noted above, the text encompasses those who knowingly present  a false or fraudulent claim, the term knowingly thus modifies present-tense verbs like presents. § 3729(a)(1)(A). As such, the focus is not, as respondents would have it, on post hoc interpretations that might have rendered their claims accurate. It is instead on what the defendant knew when presenting the claim. See also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526, Comment e (It is enough that being conscious that he has neither knowledge nor belief in the existence of the matter he chooses to assert it as a fact), accord, Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U.S. 93, 105, 136 S.Ct. 1923, 195 L.Ed.2d 278 (2016) (Culpability is generally measured against the knowledge of the actor at the time of the challenged conduct).",Thomas,0,
2022-054,63,"The difficulty here, however, is that the phrase usual and customary is, on its face, less than perfectly clear. We assume (as the District Court ruled in SuperValu's case) that respondents' usual and customary prices were their discounted ones, if so, it might have been a forgivable mistake if respondents had honestly read the phrase as referring to retail prices, not discounted prices. But the Seventh Circuit did not hold that respondents made an honest mistake, it held that, because other people might make an honest mistake, defendants' subjective beliefs became irrelevant to their scienter. Respondents make three main arguments in support of that rule. But none is persuasive.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,65,"Respondents first focus on the inherent ambiguity of the phrase at issue here, asserting that they could not have known that their claims were inaccurate because they could not have known what the phrase usual and customary actually meant. The most that is possible, respondents posit, is that they took a (correct) guess.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,66,"We disagree. Although the terms, in isolation, may have been somewhat ambiguous,  that ambiguity does not preclude respondents from having learned their correct meaning—or, at least, becoming aware of a substantial likelihood of the terms' correct meaning. To illustrate why, consider a hypothetical driver who sees a road sign that says Drive Only Reasonable Speeds. That driver, without any more information, might have no way of knowing what speeds are reasonable and what speeds are too fast. But then assume that the same driver was informed earlier in the day by a police officer that speeds over 50 mph are unreasonable and then noticed that all the other cars around him are going only 48 mph. In that case, the driver might know that Reasonable Speeds are anything under 50 mph, or, at the least, he might be aware of an unjustifiably high risk that anything over 50 mph is unreasonable. Indeed, if the same police officer later pulled the driver over, we imagine that he would be hard pressed to argue that some other person might have understood the sign to allow driving at 80 mph.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,67,"The same analysis applies here. According to petitioners, respondents received notice that the phrase usual and customary referred to their discounted prices (in some cases, it seems, from the same entities to which they reported their prices). And, according to petitioners, respondents comprehended those notices and then tried to hide their discounted prices. If that is true, then perhaps respondents actually knew what the phrase meant, or perhaps respondents were aware of an unjustifiably high risk that the phrase referred to their discounted prices. And, if that is true, then respondents may have known that their claims were false. The facial ambiguity of the phrase thus does not by itself preclude a finding of scienter under the FCA.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,69,"Second, like the Seventh Circuit, respondents rely on Safeco. They contend that Safeco already interpreted the common-law definitions of knowing and reckless and that it did so by looking first at whether the defendant's reading of the statute was objectively unreasonable. 551 U.S., at 69, 127 S.Ct. 2201. Accordingly, respondents conclude that, because the FCA has the same common-law terms, it should be read with the same, objective common-law focus.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,70,"This argument fails twice over. First, Safeco interpreted a different statute, the FCRA, which had a different mens rea standard, `willfully.' Id., at 52, 127 S.Ct. 2201 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1681n(a)). While Safeco did reference the common law's standards for knowing and reckless conduct, see 551 U.S., at 59-60, 68-69, 127 S.Ct. 2201, its interpretation was ultimately tied to the FCRA's particular text. To take Safeco as establishing categorical rules for those terms would accordingly abandon the care we have traditionally taken to construe such words in their particular statutory context. Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U.S. 573, 585, 130 S.Ct. 1605, 176 L.Ed.2d 519 (2010). And, as explained above, the FCA's scienter standards are plainly satisfied by a defendant's conscious belief that his claims are false.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,71,"Second, Safeco did not purport to set forth the purely objective safe harbor that respondents invoke. To the contrary, Safeco stated that a person is reckless if he acts knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize that his actions were substantially risky. 551 U.S., at 69, 127 S.Ct. 2201 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted). Or, as Safeco alternatively put it, the common law of recklessness contained an objective standard because it encompassed  actions involving an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known. Id., at 68, 127 S.Ct. 2201 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted), see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 500, Comment a (1964) (Recklessness may consist of either of two different types of conduct. In one the actor knows  of facts which create a high degree of risk). Thus, as we have stated previously, nothing in Safeco suggests that we should look to facts that the defendant neither knew nor had reason to know at the time he acted. Halo Electronics, 579 U.S., at 106, 136 S.Ct. 1923.6 By a similar token here, we do not look to legal interpretations that respondents did not believe or have reason to believe at the time they submitted their claims.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,73,"Respondents make one more argument, approaching the issue from a somewhat different angle. They contend that, at common law, their claims would not be actionable as fraudulent even if their reported prices were not accurate under the correct meaning of usual and customary. Their argument is as follows: At common law, misrepresentations of law are not actionable, only misrepresentations of fact are. Because the FCA incorporates the common law of fraud, it embodies that same limitation. And the claims here would have been knowingly false only because respondents correctly understood what usual and customary meant. Therefore, respondents conclude, their reports were not false because of any misrepresentation of fact, to the contrary, their claims would have been false only because of their view of the law.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,74,"But those premises do not support that conclusion. To be sure, many courts appear to have stated—as a general rule—that misrepresentations of law are not actionable at common law. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 545, W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts § 109, pp. 758-759 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). So, for example, if a defendant had told the plaintiff, your claim will be dismissed because federal courts lack jurisdiction over claims like that, that representation might not be actionable as a fraud. See ibid., Utah Power & Light Co. v. Federal Ins. Co., 983 F.2d 1549, 1556 (CA10 1993). Varying rationales appear to have been given for this rule, including that such statements are of mere opinion and that no one could justifiably rely on them. See Dobbs § 677, at 688.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,75,"For purposes of these cases, we assume without deciding that the FCA incorporates some version of this rule, even then, the rule has significant limits on its own terms. As relevant here, statements involving some legal analysis remain actionable if they carry with them by implication an assertion about facts that justify the speaker's statement. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 545, Comment c, see also Prosser & Keeton § 109, at 759. So, as a contrasting example, a person might be liable for falsely stating that the plumbing work that I did on your house complied with state law. See Sorenson v. Gardner, 215 Ore. 255, 261, 334 P.2d 471, 474 (1959). That is because such a statement says  something about both the correct meaning of building codes and the facts about the home's construction. Ibid., see also Hoyt Properties, Inc. v. Production Resource Group, L. L. C., 736 N.W.2d 313, 319 (Minn. 2007). And homeowners might justifiably rely on that latter representation about the facts, which thus could be actionable as fraud.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,76,"Respondents' disclosures here sound more like our hypothetical plumber, not our hypothetical legal advisor. Rather than saying, this is what `usual and customary' means, respondents essentially said, this is what our `usual and customary' prices are. In doing so, they plainly implied facts about their prices that were not known to the plan sponsors, pharmacy benefit managers, and state Medicaid agencies that received their claims. Petitioners' cases thus make out a valid fraud theory even under respondents' common-law rule.* * *",Thomas,0,
2022-054,77,"Under the FCA, petitioners may establish scienter by showing that respondents (1) actually knew that their reported prices were not their usual and customary prices when they reported those prices, (2) were aware of a substantial risk that their higher, retail prices were not their usual and customary prices and intentionally avoided learning whether their reports were accurate, or (3) were aware of such a substantial and unjustifiable risk but submitted the claims anyway. § 3729(b)(1)(A). If petitioners can make that showing, then it does not matter whether some other, objectively reasonable interpretation of usual and customary would point to respondents' higher prices. For scienter, it is enough if respondents believed that their claims were not accurate.",Thomas,0,
2022-054,78,"We need not address any of the other factual or legal disputes involved in these cases, including whether petitioners have made a showing sufficient under the correct legal standard to preclude summary judgment. Nor do we need to address any of the parties' policy arguments, which cannot supersede the clear statutory text. Escobar, 579 U.S., at 192, 136 S.Ct. 1989.

Today we consider a criminal conviction for communications falling within that historically unprotected category. The question presented is whether the First Amendment still requires proof that the defendant had some subjective understanding of the threatening nature of his statements. We hold that it does, but that a mental state of recklessness is sufficient. The State must show  that the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening violence. The State need not prove any more demanding form of subjective intent to threaten another.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,26,"From 2014 to 2016, petitioner Billy Counterman sent hundreds of Facebook messages to C. W., a local singer and musician. The two had never met, and C. W. never responded. In fact, she repeatedly blocked Counterman. But each time, he created a new Facebook account and resumed his contacts. Some of his messages were utterly prosaic (Good morning sweetheart, I am going to the store would you like anything?)—except that they were coming from a total stranger. 3 App. 465. Others suggested that Counterman might be surveilling C. W. He asked was that you in the white Jeep?, referenced a fine display with your partner, and noted a couple of physical sightings. 497 P.3d 1039, 1044 (Colo. App. 2021). And most critically, a number expressed anger at C. W. and envisaged harm befalling her: Fuck off permanently. Ibid. Staying in cyber life is going to kill you. Ibid. You're not being good for human relations. Die. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,27,"The messages put C. W. in fear and upended her daily existence. She believed that Counterman was threatening her life, was very fearful that he was following her, and was afraid she would get hurt. 2 App. 177, 181, 193. As a result, she had a lot of trouble sleeping and suffered from severe anxiety. Id., at 200, see id., at 194-198. She stopped walking alone, declined social engagements, and canceled some of her performances, though doing so caused her financial strain. See id., at 182-183, 199, 201-206, 238-239. Eventually, C. W. decided that she had to contact the authorities. Id., at 184.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,28,Colorado charged Counterman under a statute making it unlawful to repeatedly make any form of communication with another person in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress and does cause that person  to suffer serious emotional distress. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-3-602(1)(c) (2022). The only evidence the State proposed to introduce at trial were his Facebook messages.1,Kagan,0,
2022-055,29,"Counterman moved to dismiss the charge on First Amendment grounds, arguing that his messages were not true threats and therefore could not form the basis of a criminal prosecution. In line with Colorado law, the trial court assessed the true-threat issue using an objective `reasonable person' standard. People v. Cross, 127 P.3d 71, 76 (Colo. 2006). Under that standard, the State had to show that a reasonable person would have viewed the Facebook messages as threatening. By contrast, the State had no need to prove that Counterman had any kind of subjective intent to threaten C. W. In re R. D., 464 P.3d 717, 731, n. 21 (Colo. 2020). The court decided, after considering the totality of the circumstances, that Counterman's statements rose to the level of a true threat. 497 P.3d at 1045. Because that was so, the court ruled, the First Amendment posed no bar to prosecution. The court accordingly sent the case to the  jury, which found Counterman guilty as charged.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,30,"The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed. Counterman had urged the court to hold that the First Amendment required the State to show that he was aware of the threatening nature of his statements. Relying on its precedent, the court turned the request down: It declined today to say that a speaker's subjective intent to threaten is necessary under the First Amendment to procure a conviction for threatening communications. Id., at 1046 (quoting R. D., 464 P.3d at 731, n. 21). Using the established objective standard, the court then approved the trial court's ruling that Counterman's messages were true threats and so were not protected by the First Amendment. 497 P.3d at 1050. The Colorado Supreme Court denied review.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,31,"Courts are divided about (1) whether the First Amendment requires proof of a defendant's subjective mindset in true-threats cases, and (2) if so, what mens rea standard is sufficient. We therefore granted certiorari. 598 U. S. ___, 143 S.Ct. 644, 214 L.Ed.2d 382 (2023).",Kagan,0,
2022-055,33,"True threats of violence, everyone agrees, lie outside the bounds of the First Amendment's protection. And a statement can count as such a threat based solely on its objective content. The first dispute here is about whether the First Amendment nonetheless demands that the State in a true-threats case prove that the defendant was aware in some way of the threatening nature of his communications.2 Colorado argues that there is no such requirement. Counterman contends that there is one, based mainly on the likelihood that the absence of such a mens rea requirement will chill protected, non-threatening speech. Counterman's view, we decide today, is the more consistent with our precedent. To combat the kind of chill he references, our decisions have often insisted on protecting even some historically unprotected speech through the adoption of a subjective mental-state element. We follow the same path today, holding that the State must prove in true-threats cases that the defendant had some understanding of his statements' threatening character. The second issue here concerns what precise mens rea standard suffices for the First Amendment purpose at issue. Again guided by our precedent, we hold that a recklessness standard is enough. Given that a subjective standard here shields speech not independently entitled to protection—and indeed posing real dangers—we do not require that the State prove the defendant had any more specific intent to threaten the victim.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,35,"From 1791 to the present, the First Amendment has permitted restrictions  upon the content of speech in a few limited areas. United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). These historic and traditional categories are long familiar to the bar and perhaps, too, the general public. Ibid. One is incitement—statements directed at producing imminent lawless action, and likely to do so. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (per curiam). Another is defamation—false statements of fact harming another's reputation. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 340, 342, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). Still a third is obscenity—valueless material appealing to the prurient interest and describing sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). This Court has often described those historically unprotected categories of speech as being of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in their proscription. Stevens, 559 U.S. at 470, 130 S.Ct. 1577 (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis deleted).",Kagan,0,
2022-055,36,"True threats of violence is another historically unprotected category of communications. Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003), see United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709, 717-718, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012) (plurality opinion). The true in that term distinguishes what is at issue from jests, hyperbole, or other statements that when taken in context do not convey a real possibility that violence will follow (say, I am going to kill you for showing up late). Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per curiam). True threats are serious expressions conveying that a speaker means to commit an act of unlawful violence. Black, 538 U.S. at 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536. Whether the speaker is aware of, and intends to convey, the threatening aspect of the message is not part of what makes a statement a threat, as this Court recently explained. See Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. 723, 733, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015). The existence of a threat depends not on the mental state of the author, but on what the statement conveys to the person on the other end. Ibid. When the statement is understood as a true threat, all the harms that have long made threats unprotected naturally follow. True threats subject individuals to fear of violence and to the many kinds of disruption that fear engenders. Black, 538 U.S. at 360, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (internal quotation marks omitted). The facts of this case well illustrate how.3",Kagan,0,
2022-055,37,"Yet the First Amendment may still demand a subjective mental-state requirement shielding some true threats from liability. The reason relates to what is often called a chilling effect. Prohibitions on speech have the potential to chill, or deter, speech outside their boundaries. A  speaker may be unsure about the side of a line on which his speech falls. Or he may worry that the legal system will err, and count speech that is permissible as instead not. See Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 777, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 89 L.Ed.2d 783 (1986). Or he may simply be concerned about the expense of becoming entangled in the legal system. The result is self-censorship of speech that could not be proscribed—a cautious and restrictive exercise of First Amendment freedoms. Gertz, 418 U.S. at 340, 94 S.Ct. 2997. And an important tool to prevent that outcome—to stop people from steering wide of the unlawful zone—is to condition liability on the State's showing of a culpable mental state. Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Such a requirement comes at a cost: It will shield some otherwise proscribable (here, threatening) speech because the State cannot prove what the defendant thought. But the added element reduces the prospect of chilling fully protected expression. As this Court has noted, the requirement lessens the hazard of self-censorship by compensating for the law's uncertainties. Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 511, 86 S.Ct. 958, 16 L.Ed.2d 56 (1966). Or said a bit differently: By reducing an honest speaker's fear that he may accidentally or erroneously incur liability, a mens rea requirement provides `breathing room' for more valuable speech. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 733, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).",Kagan,0,
2022-055,38,"That kind of strategic protection features in our precedent concerning the most prominent categories of historically unprotected speech. Gertz, 418 U.S. at 342, 94 S.Ct. 2997. Defamation is the best known and best theorized example. False and defamatory statements of fact, we have held, have no constitutional value. Id., at 340, 94 S.Ct. 2997, see Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 718-719, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion). Yet a public figure cannot recover for the injury such a statement causes unless the speaker acted with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), see Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964) (using the same standard for criminal libel). That rule is based on fear of self-censorship—the worry that without such a subjective mental-state requirement, the uncertainties and expense of litigation will deter speakers from making even truthful statements. Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 279, 84 S.Ct. 710. The First Amendment, we have concluded, requires that we protect some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters. Gertz, 418 U.S. at 341, 94 S.Ct. 2997.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,39,"The same idea arises in the law respecting obscenity and incitement to unlawful conduct. Like threats, incitement inheres in particular words used in particular contexts: Its harm can arise even when a clueless speaker fails to grasp his expression's nature and consequence. But still, the First Amendment precludes punishment, whether civil or criminal, unless the speaker's words were intended (not just likely) to produce imminent disorder. Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105, 109, 94 S.Ct. 326, 38 L.Ed.2d 303 (1973) (per curiam), see Brandenburg, 395 U.S. at 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 927-929, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982). That rule helps prevent a law from deterring mere advocacy of illegal acts—a kind of speech falling within the First Amendment's core. Brandenburg, 395 U.S. at 449, 89 S.Ct. 1827. And for a similar reason, the First Amendment demands proof of a defendant's  mindset to make out an obscenity case. Obscenity is obscenity, whatever the purveyor's mental state. But we have repeatedly recognized that punishment depends on a vital element of scienter— often described as the defendant's awareness of the character and nature of the materials he distributed. Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 122-123, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974), see Elonis, 575 U.S. at 739, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (reiterating Hamling). The rationale should by now be familiar. Yes, obscene speech and writings are not protected. Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 152, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959). But punishing their distribution without regard to scienter would have the collateral effect of inhibiting protected expression. Id., at 151, 80 S.Ct. 215. Given the ambiguities inherent in the definition of obscenity, the First Amendment requires proof of scienter to avoid the hazard of self-censorship. Mishkin, 383 U.S. at 511, 86 S.Ct. 958.4",Kagan,0,
2022-055,40,"The same reasoning counsels in favor of requiring a subjective element in a true-threats case. This Court again must consider the prospect of chilling non-threatening expression, given the ordinary citizen's predictable tendency to steer wide of the unlawful zone. Speiser, 357 U.S. at 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332. The speaker's fear of mistaking whether a statement is a threat, his fear of the legal system getting that judgment wrong, his fear, in any event, of incurring legal costs—all those may lead him to swallow words that are in fact not true threats. Some 50 years ago, Justice Marshall made the point when reviewing a true-threats prosecution arguably involving only political hyperbole. See Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975). The Court in Rogers reversed the conviction on other grounds, but Justice Marshall focused on the danger of deterring non-threatening speech. An objective standard, turning only on how reasonable observers would construe a statement in context, would make people give threats a wide berth. Id., at 47, 95 S.Ct. 2091 (concurring opinion). And so use of that standard would discourage the uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate that the First Amendment is intended to protect. Id., at 48, 95 S.Ct. 2091 (quoting Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 270, 84 S.Ct. 710).",Kagan,0,
2022-055,41,"The reasoning—and indeed some of the words—came straight from this Court's decisions insisting on a subjective element in other unprotected-speech cases, whether involving defamation, incitement, or obscenity. No doubt, the approach in all of those cases has a cost: Even as it lessens chill of protected speech, it makes prosecution of otherwise proscribable, and often dangerous, communications harder. And the balance between those two effects may play out differently in different contexts, as the next part of this opinion discusses. But the ban on an objective standard remains the same, lest true-threats prosecutions chill too much protected, non-threatening expression.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,43,"The next question concerns the type of subjective standard the First Amendment requires. The law of mens rea offers three basic choices. Purpose is the most culpable level in the standard mental-state hierarchy, and the hardest to prove. A person acts purposefully when he consciously desires a result—so here, when he wants his words to be received as threats. United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 404, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). Next down, though not often distinguished from purpose, is knowledge. Ibid. A person acts knowingly when he is aware that a result is practically certain to follow—so here, when he knows to a practical certainty that others will take his words as threats. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). A greater gap separates those two from recklessness. A person acts recklessly, in the most common formulation, when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the conduct will cause harm to another. Voisine v. United States, 579 U.S. 686, 691, 136 S.Ct. 2272, 195 L.Ed.2d 736 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). That standard involves insufficient concern with risk, rather than awareness of impending harm. See Borden v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1817, 1823-1824, 210 L.Ed.2d 63 (2021) (plurality opinion). But still, recklessness is morally culpable conduct, involving a deliberate decision to endanger another. Voisine, 579 U.S. at 694, 136 S.Ct. 2272. In the threats context, it means that a speaker is aware that others could regard his statements as threatening violence and delivers them anyway. Elonis, 575 U.S. at 746, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).5",Kagan,0,
2022-055,44,"Among those standards, recklessness offers the right path forward. We have so far mostly focused on the constitutional interest in free expression, and on the correlative need to take into account threat prosecutions' chilling effects. But the precedent we have relied on has always recognized— and insisted on accommodating—the competing value in regulating historically unprotected expression. Gertz, 418 U.S. at 348, 94 S.Ct. 2997. Here, as we have noted, that value lies in protecting against the profound harms, to both individuals and society, that attend true threats of violence—as evidenced in this case. See supra, at 2112, 2114-2115. The  injury associated with those statements caused history long ago to place them out-side the First Amendment's bounds. When despite that judgment we require use of a subjective mental-state standard, we necessarily impede some true-threat prosecutions. And as we go up the subjective mens rea ladder, that imposition on States' capacity to counter true threats becomes still greater—and, presumably, with diminishing returns for protected expression. In advancing past recklessness, we make it harder for a State to substantiate the needed inferences about mens rea (absent, as is usual, direct evidence). And of particular importance, we prevent States from convicting morally culpable defendants. See Elonis, 575 U.S. at 745, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (opinion of ALITO, J.). For reckless defendants have done more than make a bad mistake. They have consciously accepted a substantial risk of inflicting serious harm.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,45,"Using a recklessness standard also fits with the analysis in our defamation decisions. As noted earlier, the Court there adopted a recklessness rule, applicable in both civil and criminal contexts, as a way of accommodating competing interests. See supra, at 2115-2116. In the more than half-century in which that standard has governed, few have suggested that it needs to be higher—in other words, that still more First Amendment breathing space is required. Gertz, 418 U.S. at 342, 94 S.Ct. 2997. And we see no reason to offer greater insulation to threats than to defamation. See Elonis, 575 U.S. at 748, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The societal interests in countering the former are at least as high. And the protected speech near the borderline of true threats (even though sometimes political, as in Rogers) is, if anything, further from the First Amendment's central concerns than the chilled speech in Sullivan-type cases (i.e., truthful reputation-damaging statements about public officials and figures).",Kagan,0,
2022-055,46,"It is true that our incitement decisions demand more—but the reason for that demand is not present here. When incitement is at issue, we have spoken in terms of specific intent, presumably equivalent to purpose or knowledge. See Hess, 414 U.S. at 109, 94 S.Ct. 326, supra, at 2115-2116. In doing so, we recognized that incitement to disorder is commonly a hair's-breadth away from political advocacy—and particularly from strong protests against the government and prevailing social order. Brandenburg, 395 U.S. at 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827. Such protests gave rise to all the cases in which the Court demanded a showing of intent. See ibid., Hess, 414 U.S. at 106, 94 S.Ct. 326, Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. at 888, 928, 102 S.Ct. 3409. And the Court decided those cases against a resonant historical backdrop: the Court's failure, in an earlier era, to protect mere advocacy of force or lawbreaking from legal sanction. See, e.g., Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927), Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (1925), Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 40 S.Ct. 17, 63 L.Ed. 1173 (1919). A strong intent requirement was, and remains, one way to guarantee history was not repeated. It was a way to ensure that efforts to prosecute incitement would not bleed over, either directly or through a chilling effect, to dissenting political speech at the First Amendment's core. But the potency of that protection is not needed here. For the most part, the speech on the other side of the true-threats boundary line—as compared with the advocacy addressed in our incitement decisions—is neither so central to the theory of the First Amendment nor so vulnerable to government prosecutions. It is not just that our incitement decisions are distinguishable, it is more that they compel the use of a distinct standard here.6  That standard, again, is recklessness. It offers enough `breathing space' for protected speech, without sacrificing too many of the benefits of enforcing laws against true threats. Elonis, 575 U.S. at 748, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (opinion of ALITO, J.). As with any balance, something is lost on both sides: The rule we adopt today is neither the most speech-protective nor the most sensitive to the dangers of true threats. But in declining one of those two alternative paths, something more important is gained: Not having it all—because that is impossible—but having much of what is important on both sides of the scale.7",Kagan,0,
2022-055,48,"It is time to return to Counterman's case, though only a few remarks are necessary. Counterman, as described above, was prosecuted in accordance with an objective standard. See supra, at 2112-2113. The State had to show only that a reasonable person would understand his statements as threats. It did not have to show any awareness on his part that the statements could be understood that way. For the reasons stated, that is a violation of the First Amendment.",Kagan,0,
2022-055,49,We accordingly vacate the judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.,Kagan,0,

2022-055,52,"When the government seeks to punish speech based on its content, the First Amendment typically imposes stringent requirements. This ensures that the government, even when pursuing compelling objectives, does not unduly burden our Nation's commitment to free expression. From 1791 to the present, however, the First Amendment has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas. United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). These categories must be well-defined and narrowly limited in light of the serious consequences that flow from carving out speech from ordinary First Amendment protections. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,53,"True threats are one such category, and there is a tradition of criminalizing threats stretching back centuries. This includes punishing single utterances based on the message conveyed. One paradigmatic example of this would be writing and mailing a letter threatening to assassinate  the President. Such laws are plainly important. There is no longstanding tradition, however, of punishing speech merely because it is unintentionally threatening. Instead, this Court's precedent, along with historical statutes and cases, reflect a commonsense understanding that threatening someone is an intentional act. As to what intent is needed, traditionally, one intends certain consequences when he desires that his acts cause those consequences or knows that those consequences are substantially certain to result from his acts. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 150, 107 S.Ct. 1676, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). This does not require showing that an individual intends to carry through with the threat. But it does require showing that an individual desires to threaten or is substantially certain that her statements will be understood as threatening.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,54,"Today, unfortunately, the Court unnecessarily departs from this traditional understanding. That is not to say that I disagree with the Court on everything. Far from it. I join the Court's conclusion that some subjective mens rea is required in true-threats cases. I also agree that in this particular case, where petitioner was prosecuted for stalking that involved threatening statements, a mens rea of recklessness is amply sufficient. Where I part ways with the Court is that I would not reach the distinct and more complex question whether a mens rea of recklessness is sufficient for true-threats prosecutions generally. Further, requiring nothing more than a mens rea of recklessness is inconsistent with precedent, history, and the commitment to even harmful speech that the First Amendment enshrines. I therefore respectfully concur only in part and in the judgment.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,56,"As an initial matter, I do not believe that this Court should reach the question whether recklessness is sufficient for true-threats prosecutions. A key conceptual distinction is helpful for explaining why. On the one hand, there are statements that are objectively threatening. In some cases, such statements can be punished because they fall into the unprotected category of true threats. Yet such statements can also be punished if they fall into another category of unprotected speech, such as speech integral to criminal conduct. Or they might warrant less First Amendment protection for other reasons. On the other hand, there is the question of what constitutes the well-defined and longstanding category of unprotected true threats. It is with this latter question that I do not see the need to address whether a mens rea of recklessness is sufficient across the board.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,57,"First, the courts below did not address whether recklessness was sufficient to prosecute true threats and neither of the actual parties have advocated a recklessness standard. Colorado disclaimed the idea that recklessness was required, and petitioner asserted, correctly, that recklessness had not been raised under traditional principles of party presentation. The briefing on recklessness consists almost entirely of a few pages of an argument in the alternative at the tail end of an amicus brief filed by the United States.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,58,"Second, because petitioner was prosecuted for stalking involving threatening speech, this case does not require resort to the true-threats exemption to the First Amendment.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,59,"True-threats doctrine covers content-based prosecutions for single utterances of pure speech, which need not even be communicated to the subject of the threat. Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per curiam). The First Amendment would normally  place strict limits on such prosecutions. So there is typically a need to determine whether the speech in question falls within the traditionally unprotected category of true threats.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,60,"This is not such a case, however. Petitioner was convicted for stalking causing serious emotional distress for a combination of threatening statements and repeated, unwanted, direct contact with C. W. 497 P.3d 1039, 1043 (Colo. App. 2021).1 This kind of prosecution raises fewer First Amendment concerns for a variety of reasons. Stalking can be carried out through speech but need not be, which requires less First Amendment scrutiny when speech is swept in. See, e.g., Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 62, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006). The content of the repeated communications can sometimes be irrelevant, such as persistently calling someone and hanging up, or a stream of utterly prosaic communications. Ante, at 2111-2112. Repeatedly forcing intrusive communications directly into the personal life of an unwilling recipient also enjoys less protection. Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U.S. 728, 738, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 25 L.Ed.2d 736 (1970). Finally, while there is considerable risk with a single intemperate utterance that a speaker will accidentally or erroneously incur liability, ante, at 2115 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), that risk is far reduced with a course of repeated unwanted contact. Take, for example, petitioner continuously contacting C. W. despite her blocking him.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,61,"Given this, prosecuting threatening statements made as part of a course of stalking does not squarely present the hardest questions about the mens rea required to prosecute isolated utterances based solely on their content.2 True-threats doctrine came up below only because of the lower courts' doubtful assumption that petitioner could be prosecuted only if his actions fell under the true-threats exception. I do not think that is accurate, given the lessened First Amendment concerns at issue. In such cases, recklessness is amply sufficient. And I would stop there. There is simply no need to reach out in this stalking case to determine whether anything more than recklessness is needed for punishing true threats generally.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,63,"Lest there be any doubt, the First Amendment stakes around the definition of true threats are high indeed. The First Amendment's mantle covers speech that is vituperative, abusive and inexact. Watts, 394 U.S. at 708, 89 S.Ct. 1399. It might be tempting to dismiss seemingly low-value speech as unworthy of  robust First Amendment protections. Mahanoy Area School Dist. v. B. L., 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2038, 2048, 210 L.Ed.2d 403 (2021). Yet most of what we say to one another lacks `religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value' (let alone serious value), but it is still sheltered from Government regulation. Stevens, 559 U.S. at 479, 130 S.Ct. 1577 (emphasis deleted). First Amendment vigilance is especially  important when speech is disturbing, frightening, or painful, because the undesirability of such speech will place a heavy thumb in favor of silencing it. In response, the Court has upheld First Amendment rights in the context of gruesome animal cruelty videos, id., at 472, 130 S.Ct. 1577, cross burning, Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 347-348, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003), hateful rhetoric in protests of the funerals of fallen soldiers, Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 448-449, 458, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011), and computer-generated images of child pornography, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 239-240, 258, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,64,"The risk of overcriminalizing upsetting or frightening speech has only been increased by the internet. Our society's discourse occurs more and more in the `vast democratic forums of the Internet' in general, and social media in particular. Packingham v. North Carolina, 582 U.S. 98, 104, 137 S.Ct. 1730, 198 L.Ed.2d 273 (2017) (citation omitted). Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission have led to equally rapid and ever-evolving changes in what society accepts as proper behavior. Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.S. 746, 759, 130 S.Ct. 2619, 177 L.Ed.2d 216 (2010). Different corners of the internet have considerably different norms around appropriate speech. Online communication can also lack many normal contextual clues, such as who is speaking, tone of voice, and expression. Moreover, it is easy for speech made in a one context to inadvertently reach a larger audience.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,65,"Without sufficient protection for unintentionally threatening speech, a high school student who is still learning norms around appropriate language could easily go to prison for sending another student violent music lyrics, or for unreflectingly using language he read in an online forum. A drunken joke in bad taste can lead to criminal prosecution. Perez v. Florida, 580 U. S. 1187, 137 S.Ct. 853, 197 L.Ed.2d 480 (2017) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in denial of certiorari). In the heat of the moment, someone may post an enraged comment under a news story about a controversial topic. Another person might reply equally heatedly. In a Nation that has never been timid about its opinions, political or otherwise, this is commonplace.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,66,"Many of this Court's true-threats cases involve such charged political speech. See Black, 538 U.S. at 348-349, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (Ku Klux Klan rally), Watts, 394 U.S. at 707, 89 S.Ct. 1399 (antiwar protest), Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 41-42, 47-48, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (MARSHALL, J., concurring) (opposition to Nixon's policies toward China). Amici give further contemporary examples of such speech from across the political spectrum. See, e.g., Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 24-29. Much of this speech exists in a gray area where it will be quite hard to predict whether a jury would find it threatening. And the ubiquity of such speech raises the possibility of highly discretionary enforcement.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,67,"The burdens of overcriminalization will fall hardest on certain groups. A jury's determination of when angry hyperbole crosses the line will depend on amorphous norms around language, which will vary greatly from one discursive community to another. Juries' decisions will reflect their background knowledge and media consumption. Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1876, 1890, 201 L.Ed.2d 201 (2018). Speakers whose ideas or views occupy the fringes of our society have more to fear, for their violent and extreme rhetoric, even if intended simply to convey an idea or express displeasure, is more likely  to strike a reasonable person as threatening. United States v. White, 670 F.3d 498, 525 (C.A.4 2012) (FLOYD, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Members of certain groups, including religious and cultural minorities, can also use language that is more susceptible to being misinterpreted by outsiders. And unfortunately yet predictably, racial and cultural stereotypes can also influence whether speech is perceived as dangerous. See, e.g., A. Dunbar, C. Kubrin, & N. Scurich, The Threatening Nature of Rap Music, 22 J. Psychol. Pub. Pol'y & L. 281, 281-282, 288-290 (2016).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,68,"On the other hand, the internet has also made stalking and harassment even easier. Stalking can be devastating and dangerous. See Brief for First Amendment Scholars as Amici Curiae 7-8. Lives can be ruined, and in the most tragic instances, lives are lost. Ibid. Harassers can hide behind online anonymity while tormenting others. This happens in the context of intimate relationships and it happens with strangers. Overly constraining our society's ability to respond to stalking would come at a real cost. For the reasons given, however, a mens rea standard for true threats would not hinder stalking prosecutions. See supra, at 2120-2122.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,69,"Even isolated threatening speech can do real harm. Such speech not only disrupts lives, it can silence the speech of others who become afraid to speak out. A mens rea requirement would not, however, present an uncommon or insurmountable barrier to true-threats prosecutions.3 Nonetheless, under such a standard, there will be some speech that some find threatening that will not and should not land anyone in prison.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,71,"These high First Amendment stakes are further reason for caution when delineating the boundaries of what constitutes a true threat. In undertaking that analysis, the Court and I part ways on the order of operations. The Court begins by defining true threats as all objectively threatening speech, entirely independent of whether the speaker intended to be threatening, ante, at 2114-2115, and the lead dissent agrees, post, at 2133-2134 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). The Court gets there by relying on this Court's interpretation of the word threat in a federal statute. Ante, at 2114-2115 (citing Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. 723, 733, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015)). The Court declares all such speech categorically unprotected, and then asks what buffer zone is needed in order to protect other, unthreatening speech. See ante, at 2113-2115.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,72,"Respectfully, I see the analysis differently. The first step in the analysis should instead be to ask about the scope of the well-defined and narrow category of true threats as a constitutional matter. This Court has already warned about the danger of creating new categories of unprotected speech exempt from the ordinary First Amendment framework for balancing our society's commitment to free expression with other interests. Stevens, 559 U.S. at 470, 130 S.Ct. 1577. If courts were at liberty to redefine what counts as a threat or defamation at will, this would achieve the same results as creating new categories of unprotected speech.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,73,"Thus, the Court must first ask whether there is a long-standing tradition of punishing  inadvertent threats as true threats. This Court's prior definition of the word threat in a federal statute, looking primarily to dictionaries, Elonis, 575 U.S. at 733, 135 S.Ct. 2001, does not tell us the scope of true threats for First Amendment purposes. Elonis itself made clear that it did not  consider any First Amendment issues. Id., at 740, 135 S.Ct. 2001. Instead, a careful examination of this Court's true-threats precedent and the history of threat crimes does not support a long-settled tradition of punishing inadvertently threatening speech.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,75,"A natural place to begin, one might think, would be with this Court's most recent decision involving the First Amendment, mens rea, and true threats. Yet to read the Court's decision, one would have little idea that in a seminal 2003 decision, this Court held that a threat conviction could not stand because of an insufficient mens rea requirement. See Black, 538 U.S. 343, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535. Black plainly sets out a conception of true threats as including a mens rea requirement.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,76,"In Black, the Court confronted the constitutionality of a Virginia statute that prohibited burning a cross with intent to intimidate. Only part of the decision in Black is contained in a five-Justice majority opinion. The other relevant parts of the decision were written by the Members of that majority, who split into a four-Justice plurality and Justice Scalia's partial concurrence in judgment.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,77,"The majority explained why a prohibition on cross burning with intent to threaten was constitutional, beginning by defining the category of true threats. `True threats,' the majority explained encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence. Id., at 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (emphasis added). However, the speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat, as true threats also include intimidation alone. Id., at 359-360, 123 S.Ct. 1536. And intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Id., at 360, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,78,"To the extent the Virginia statute covered intentionally threatening cross burning, it was thus tailored to cover only true threats. Critically, however, the statute also provided that `any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate.' Id., at 348, 123 S.Ct. 1536. In other words, the all-important intent requirement could be satisfied by the mere conduct itself.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,79,"Consistent with the majority's definition of true threats, both the plurality and Justice Scalia agreed that the lack of a sufficient intent requirement meant that a conviction under the statute could not stand. Id., at 367, 379, 123 S.Ct. 1536. For the plurality, the intent requirement was the very reason why a State may ban cross burning because it distinguished between the constitutionally unprotected true threat of burning a cross with intent to intimidate and cross burning as a statement of ideology. Id., at 365-366, 123 S.Ct. 1536.4 For Justice Scalia, the plurality  was correct in all of this. Id., at 372, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part). There was a constitutional need for a distinction between cross burning `intended to intimidate' and cross burning as `a statement of ideology.' Ibid. The plurality and Justice Scalia only parted ways as to whether to hold that the statute was facially invalid, id., at 367, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion), or just that the jury instructions made it unclear whether the jury has rendered its verdict (as it must) with sufficient consideration of intent to intimidate, id., at 380, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,80,"The through-line is not hard to discern. First, unprotected true threats include a subjective mens rea requirement. Id., at 360, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (majority opinion). Second, as a result, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment insofar as it bans cross burning with intent to intimidate. Id., at 362, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (majority opinion). Third, a conviction could not stand if it had categorically dispensed with that intent requirement, id., at 365-366, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (plurality opinion), or if the jury had insufficiently considered intent to intimidate, id., at 380, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,81,"In sum, all five Justices in the Black majority agreed that a true-threats prosecution could not stand under the First Amendment without a sufficient subjective mens rea requirement.5",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,83,"In defining true threats as statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence, id., at 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536, the Court in Black echoed the traditional understanding of threats. Historically, threat crimes covered the same kind of subjectively threatening speech Black invoked.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,84,"In reviewing this history, it is also vital to keep in mind the nature of the inquiry. Removing speech from normal First Amendment scrutiny is a major shift in the balance of expression and public interest that our Constitution generally strikes. The inquiry is therefore whether there is a long-settled tradition of prohibiting inadvertently threatening speech. Stevens, 559 U.S. at 469, 130 S.Ct. 1577. None of the other opinions, however, identify a historical case that expressly raised the question  whether a subjective mens rea is required and held that it is not. That is a remarkable thing when one considers that the sample size consists of decisions from both sides of the Atlantic across centuries.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,85,"There was a long tradition of crimes for threatening another person in order to extort them. See, e.g., 1796 N. J. Laws § 57, p. 108. Colorado and the United States admit that this core category of threat crimes required intent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,86,"Even beyond that, a subjective mens rea remained a key component of threat offenses. An 18th-century English statute made it a capital offense to knowingly send any letter  threatening to kill or murder any of his Majesty's subject or subjects or to threaten arson. 27 Geo. II, c. 15, in 21 Eng. Stat. at Large 184 (1754). A leading treatise explained that the statute was levelled against such whose intention it was to obtain their object by creating terror in the victim's mind. 2 W. Russell & D. Davis, Crimes & Misdemeanors *1845 (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,87,"Consistent with this, defendants were convicted of knowingly, wilfully, and feloniously sending threatening letters. Rex v. Tyler, 1 Mood. 428, 168 Eng. Rep. 1330 (1835), Rex v.

Rep. 173 (1776) (indictment for feloniously sending a threatening letter). `Knowingly and wilfully' effecting any result applies to those who know that the acts performed will have that effect, and perform them with the intention that such shall be their operation. 12 American and English Encyclopaedia of Law 522-524 (J. Merrill ed. 1890), see also J. Boag, Imperial Lexicon of the English Language 530 (1850) (defining felonious as with the deliberate purpose to commit a crime).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,88,"The necessary mens rea could sometimes be inferred from the content of the letter, but could be rebutted by other evidence. See King v. Philipps, 6 East 464, 475, 102 Eng. Rep. 1365, 1369 (1805). Courts thus considered the threat intended to be made by the prisoner and what he meant by what he had written in determining whether he had violated the statute. Regina v. Hill, 5 Cox 233, 235 (Crim. Cas. 1851), see also King v. John and Mary Hammond, 1 Leach 444, 446, 168 Eng.

2022-055,89,"Threat laws in the United States were of a piece. Some state laws about threats expressly required maliciousness. See Me. Rev. Stat., Tit. 12, ch. 154, § 26 (1840), 1884 La. Acts No. 64, § 1, p. 86. Courts more generally emphasized the importance of a mens rea requirement. See, e.g., State v. Benedict, 11 Vt. 236, 239 (1839). The North Carolina Supreme Court, for example, singled out threats as quintessential examples of offenses where it is necessary to prove the intent of the particular letter. State v. Murphy, 84 N.C. 742, 743-744 (1881). And where state statutes may have been silent on intent to threaten, courts read such requirements in. See Commonwealth v.

There is no line of cases or pattern of statutes affirmatively stating that an objective standard is sufficient.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,94,"Put together, Black and the history point to an intent requirement. When Black defined and analyzed true threats in terms of intent, there is no reason to think the Court used intent to mean anything less than its traditional definition of purpose or knowledge. See, e.g., Tison, 481 U.S. at 150, 107 S.Ct. 1676. Nor would a recklessness standard play the necessary role of distinguishing between cross burning that is `intended to intimidate'  and nonintimidating cross burning that cannot be prohibited. 538 U.S. at 372, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Given the violent history of the symbol, it is hard to imagine that any politically motivated cross burning done within view of the public could be carried out without awareness of some risk a reasonable spectator would feel threatened. See id., at 388-391, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Recklessness, which turns so heavily on an objective person standard, would not have been enough.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,95,"As to the history, it is true that over time courts have often used a wide variety of terms to describe mental states. See, e.g., Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 252, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). Yet the element of intent in the criminal law has traditionally been viewed as a bifurcated concept embracing either the specific requirement of purpose or the more general one of knowledge or awareness. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 445, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978), see also Tison, 481 U.S. at 150, 107 S.Ct. 1676, Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 270, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000) (describing feloniously as equivalent to `intent'). And at the very least, there is no well-settled history showing that it is enough for a defendant to be merely aware of some risk that their statements could be threatening. See, e.g., Borden v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 210 L.Ed.2d 63 (2021) (plurality opinion) (recklessness requires awareness of a level of risk that need not come anywhere close to a likelihood). The history is, instead, replete with the enduring and commonsense pairing of threats and intent.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,97,"The Court, eschewing Black and history, instead reaches its result based on the need for a buffer zone drawn by analogy to other categories of unprotected speech. Ante, at 2113. For the reasons above, I do not think we can leap ahead to this question. With that caveat, I agree with the Court that precedent in other areas of unprotected speech and concerns about chilling support a subjective mens rea requirement for true threats. Yet these same chilling concerns only further buttress the conclusion that true threats should be limited to intentionally threatening speech. Indeed, in the concurrence by Justice Marshall that the Court invokes, ante, at 2116-2117, he advocated requiring proof that the speaker intended his statement to be taken as a threat, based on  concerns about punishing pure speech. Rogers, 422 U.S. at 47-48, 95 S.Ct. 2091. In determining the appropriate mens rea, the Court analogizes to three categories of traditionally unprotected speech: incitement, obscenity, and defamation. None of these warrants expanding the narrow boundaries of true threats.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,99,"Speech inciting harm is the closest cousin to speech threatening harm. Both incitement and threats put other people at risk, and both spring from Justice Holmes's `clear and present danger' test. G. Blakey & B. Murray, Threats, Free Speech, and the Jurisprudence of the Federal Criminal Law, 2002 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 829, 1069 (2002). Like true threats, incitement's scope is defined in terms of both intention and effect, covering speech 1 intended to produce, and 2 likely to produce, imminent disorder. Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105, 109, 94 S.Ct. 326, 38 L.Ed.2d 303 (1973) (per curiam).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,100,"Despite their similar nature and source, the Court today draws a hard line between the two. Incitement requires `intent.' Ante, at 2115-2116. While for threats, the speaker need only be aware that others could regard his statements as threatening violence and deliver them anyway. Ante, at 2117 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court justifies this asymmetry by the idea that incitement to disorder is commonly a hair's-breadth away from political `advocacy,' ante, at 2118, and the lead dissent says much the same, post, at 2136-2137 (opinion of BARRETT, J.). These opinions offer little basis for distinguishing threats on this ground, as this Court's own cases show time and again how true-threats prosecutions sweep in political speech. See Black, 538 U.S. at 348-349, 123 S.Ct. 1536, Watts, 394 U.S. at 707, 89 S.Ct. 1399 (antiwar protest), Rogers, 422 U.S. at 41-42, 95 S.Ct. 2091 (MARSHALL, J., concurring) (opposition to Nixon's policies toward China).6 Not only that, but incitement itself is often only a hair's-breadth away from threats.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,101,"Take the seminal incitement case NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982). During a civil rights boycott, NAACP leader Charles Evers, brother of the murdered civil rights hero Medgar Evers, gave a series of heated speeches. See id., at 898-902, 102 S.Ct. 3409. He intoned that boycott violators would be `disciplined' and that `if we catch any of you going in any of them racist stores, we're gonna break your damn neck.' Id., at 902, 102 S.Ct. 3409. The Court acknowledged that in this charged context, these speeches might have been understood as inviting an unlawful form of discipline or, at least, as intending to create a fear of violence. Id., at 927, 102 S.Ct. 3409. Yet inflammatory and threatening as these speeches were, they did not constitute incitement. That was because there was no evidence—apart from the speeches themselves—that Evers authorized, ratified, or directly threatened acts of violence. Id., at 929, 102 S.Ct. 3409. His speeches were thus not `directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action' and he had not specifically intended to further an unlawful goal. Id., at 925, n. 68, 928, 102 S.Ct. 3409.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,102,"Under a recklessness rule, Claiborne would have come out the other way. So long as Evers had some subjective awareness of some risk that a reasonable person could regard his statements as threatening, that would be sufficient. It would be quite troubling indeed to adopt a rule rendering this Court's admirable defense of the First Amendment wrongly decided. Nor is Claiborne the only example. The foundational incitement case, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (per curiam), extended First Amendment protections to armed Klan members uttering racial slurs, a warning that there might have to be some revengeance taken, and plans for a `four hundred thousand strong' march in two cities. Id., at 446, 89 S.Ct. 1827. Then, as now, there would be at least some risk that a reasonable resident of those cities could feel threatened.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,103,"These concrete examples illustrate a more general principle. Speech inciting imminent and dangerous unlawful activity will reasonably be threatening to those who would be harmed by that illegality. In all such cases, whether seminal decisions by this Court or guilty pleas that barely see the inside of a courtroom, the Court's decision effectively downgrades to recklessness the mens rea required for incitement of unlawful force, prosecutors could now simply charge such offenses as true threats. This is particularly worrisome because the standard for recklessness decreases the lower the social utility of the conduct. 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.4(f) (3d ed. 2018). That is a troubling standard for juries in a polarized nation to apply in cases involving heated political speech. This collateral damage can be avoided, however, if intent to threaten is understood as part of a true threat, just like intent to incite is part of incitement.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,105,"While obscenity is a step further afield of true threats and incitement, examination of this Court's obscenity case law further supports an intent requirement for prosecutions of true threats.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,106,"The Constitution `requires proof of scienter' in part `to compensate for the ambiguities inherent in the definition of obscenity.' Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 123, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). This is in line with this Court's more general observation that vagueness of content-based regulation of speech is of special concern when it comes to criminal statutes. Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 871-872, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997).7",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,107,"Specifically, the Court has held that a knowledge mens rea is sufficient for obscenity: It is constitutionally sufficient that the prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of the contents of the materials he distributed, and that he knew the character and nature of the materials. Hamling, 418 U.S. at 123, 94 S.Ct. 2887. This ensures that not innocent but calculated purveyance of filth  is exorcised. Id., at 122, 94 S.Ct. 2887 (internal quotation marks omitted). While the Court today asserts that this Court has never determined the precise mens rea for obscenity, ante, at 2119, n. 6, the Court has cited a knowledge standard approvingly for half a century, see Hamling, 418 U.S. at 123, 94 S.Ct. 2887, Elonis, 575 U.S. at  739, 135 S.Ct. 2001.8 Applying that standard to threats, the `calculated purveyance' of a threat would require that a defendant know the threatening nature of his communication. Id., at 739, 135 S.Ct. 2001.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,108,"The considerations that drove this Court to approve a higher mens rea for obscenity apply here as well. With obscenity, the ambiguity comes partly from the reliance on `contemporary community standards' to define what is obscene. Hamling, 418 U.S. at 129, 94 S.Ct. 2887. Such a standard is notoriously amorphous, and will change a great deal between communities and over time. The same chilling concerns apply to true threats. A recklessness standard based on what a reasonable person could find threatening will depend on ever-shifting community norms around language and when heated speech crosses the line from overly aggressive to criminal. See supra, at 2121-2123.9",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,110,"Finally, the Court relies heavily upon this Court's framework for defamation. Specifically, the Court analogizes to the reckless disregard standard for defamation of public figures or punitive damages for certain claims involving private figures. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,111,"Yet while civil defamation may be the best known and best theorized example of unprotected speech, ante, at 2115, the same does not go for criminal prosecution of defamation. It is true that this Court in 1964 invalidated a prosecution for criminal libel for failing to apply the Sullivan standard, which covers only those false statements made with a high degree of awareness of their probable falsity. Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964). Yet the Court expressed strong skepticism of the very concept of criminal prosecutions for libel and noted the salutary trend of its virtual disappearance. Id., at 69-70, 85 S.Ct. 209. The Court approvingly cited the Model Penal Code's recommendation that criminal libel be limited to speech likely to cause a breach of the peace and calculated to do so. Id., at 70, 85 S.Ct. 209. This is not a promising theoretical springboard  for determining the mens rea required to criminalize other speech.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,112,"If the Court were correct that the Sullivan standard is the appropriate analogy, however, then this standard should guide how to analyze recklessness in true-threats prosecutions. The generic formulation of recklessness requires that an individual disregard a relatively unspecified level of risk that the harm in question will occur. See Borden, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1823-1824 (plurality opinion). Within that potentially broad range, Sullivan provides a more definite and demanding level of risk, reflecting the First Amendment concerns at stake. The Court has made clear that the defendant must have made the false publication with a high degree of awareness of probable falsity or must have entertained serious doubts as to the truth. Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 667, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). This makes sense. Allowing liability for awareness of a small chance that a story may be false would undermine the very shield Sullivan erects.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,113,"For similar reasons, after today's ruling, future courts grappling with how to articulate the appropriate level of recklessness in true-threats cases would be well served to consult the Sullivan standard. The equivalent to Sullivan for true threats would require a high degree of awareness that a statement was probably threatening or serious doubts as to the threatening nature of the statement. This could avoid the chilling that would arise from a more amorphous and easily satisfied standard.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,115,"This Court's various frameworks for unprotected speech do not speak with one voice, as perhaps befits the First Amendment. The above survey does not, however, give reason to depart from the traditional understanding of true threats. To the contrary, this case law supports keeping true threats within their traditional bounds. Incitement similarly requires intent. The same chilling concerns that have led this Court to approve a knowledge requirement for obscenity are present with true threats. And to the extent the civil defamation context is relevant, at the very least, it points to a precise and demanding form of recklessness.10",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,117,"Maintaining true threats doctrine within its traditional boundaries will guard against the overcriminalization of a wide range of political, artistic, and everyday speech based on its content alone. This does not mean that unintentionally threatening  communications are exempt from regulation, far from it. As explained above, there are far fewer First Amendment concerns with stalking laws that punish repeated, targeted, unwanted conduct and accompanying speech. For that reason, recklessness is quite sufficient. As to true threats, intent is neither an unusual nor an insurmountable bar. Courts and juries every day pass upon knowledge, belief and intent  having before them no more than evidence of  words and conduct, from which, in ordinary human experience, mental condition can be inferred. American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 411, 70 S.Ct. 674, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950).* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2022-055,118,"I agree with the Court's conclusion that the First Amendment requires a subjective mens rea in true-threats cases, and I also agree that recklessness is amply sufficient for this case. Yet I would stop there, leaving for another day the question of the specific mens rea required to prosecute true threats generally. If that question is reached, however, the answer is that true threats encompass a narrow band of intentional threats. Especially in a climate of intense polarization, it is dangerous to allow criminal prosecutions for heated words based solely on an amorphous recklessness standard. Our society has often concluded that an intent standard sets a proper balance between safety and the need for a guilty mind, even in cases that do not involve the First Amendment. Surely when the power of the State is called upon to imprison someone based on the content of their words alone, this standard cannot be considered excessive. Because I part ways with the Court on this score, I respectfully concur only in part and in the judgment.",Sotomayor,0,

Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). In New York Times, this Court held that the First Amendment bars public figures from recovering damages for defamation unless they can show that the statement at issue was made with `actual malice'—that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. Id., at 280, 84 S.Ct. 710. Like the majority's decision today, New York Times and the Court's decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law. McKee v.

Ante, at 2113, n. 2. The question is what more the First Amendment requires. Colorado maintains that an objective standard is enough—that is, the government must show that a reasonable person would regard the statement as a threat of violence. Counterman, however, argues that the First Amendment requires a subjective test—that is, the speaker himself must intend or know the threatening nature of the statement.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,125,"It should be easy to choose between these positions. True threats do not enjoy First Amendment protection, and nearly every other category of unprotected speech may be restricted using an objective standard. Nonetheless, the Court adopts a subjective standard, though not quite the one advanced by Counterman. The Court holds that speakers must recklessly disregard the threatening nature of their speech to lose constitutional protection. Because this unjustifiably grants true threats preferential treatment, I respectfully dissent.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,127,"Since the founding, the First Amendment has allowed the government to regulate certain areas of speech because of their constitutionally proscribable content. R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382-383, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (emphasis deleted). This includes true threats, which are serious expressions of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003), see also R. A. V., 505 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (Threats of violence are outside the First Amendment). True threats carry little value and impose great cost. See Chaplinsky v.

But the Constitution ultimately declines to protect true threats for objective reasons, not subjective ones.

Nonetheless, the Court holds Colorado's statute unconstitutional. Why? Because the Court installs a prophylactic buffer zone to avoid chilling protected speech—a buffer zone that protects true threats unless the speaker consciously disregarded a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening violence.

J., 455 U.S. at 202, 102 S.Ct. 929 (Regulation—and imposition of discipline —are permissible where the particular advertising is inherently likely to deceive or where the record indicates that a particular form or method of advertising has in fact been deceptive (emphasis added)), see also Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U.S. 229, 250-253, 130 S.Ct. 1324, 176 L.Ed.2d 79 (2010). Thus, the government is free to prevent the dissemination of commercial speech that is false, deceptive, or misleading, without regard to whether the speaker knew that the recipient would be deceived or misled. Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 638, 105 S.Ct. 2265.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,135,"Or take obscenity, which we have long held is not protected by the freedoms of speech and press. Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 481, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). Speech qualifies as obscene if the `average person, applying contemporary community standards,' would conclude that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). The jury must also make an objective judgment about whether the speech depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and whether it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Ibid. The speaker's `belief as to the obscenity or non-obscenity of the material is irrelevant.' Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 120-121, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). So long as the defendant has knowledge of the contents of the materials, her speech may be constitutionally regulated. Id., at 123, 94 S.Ct. 2887. An objective, reasonable-person standard applies.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,136,"In an effort to bolster its position, the Court floats a different standard for obscenity laws, asserting that the First Amendment demands proof of a defendant's mindset to make out an obscenity case. Ante, at 2116. By mindset, the Court apparently means that the defendant must have some awareness that an average person would consider the materials obscene. But the Court draws this conclusion from cases rejecting a strict liability standard—for example, we have held that the proprietor of a bookstore cannot be liable for possessing an obscene book unless he knew what was in it. Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 149, 155, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959), Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 510-512, 86 S.Ct. 958, 16 L.Ed.2d 56 (1966), see also Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 643-644, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968).2 Knowing  what the material depicts is not the same as knowing how the average person would react to it—just as there is an important difference between Counterman's knowledge of what his words meant and his knowledge of how they would be perceived. Though the Court conflates the two, our obscenity cases have repeatedly refused to require the latter as a matter of constitutional law. Hamling, 418 U.S. at 120-123, 94 S.Ct. 2887, Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S. 29, 41-42, 16 S.Ct. 480, 40 L.Ed. 606 (1896). So obscenity doctrine does not help Counterman.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,137,"The Court leans hardest on defamation law, but its argument depends on a single, cherry-picked strand of the doctrine. Yes, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan requires public figures and public officials to show actual malice on a defamation claim, and we have defined actual malice as knowledge that the statement was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. 376 U.S. 254, 279-280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). But that is not the full story. A private person need only satisfy an objective standard to recover actual damages for defamation. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 347-350, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). And if the defamatory speech does not involve a matter of public concern, she may recover punitive damages with the same showing. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 760-761, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985) (plurality opinion). We have justified that distinction on the ground that public-figure defamation claims may deter would-be critics of official conduct  from voicing their criticism, which would dampen the vigor and limit the variety of public debate. Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 279, 84 S.Ct. 710. Not only that, but the state interest in protecting public figures is weaker, since they tend to enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false statements. Gertz, 418 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. 2997. So, despite what the Court says, Sullivan does not stand for the broad proposition that the First Amendment demands a subjective mental-state requirement. Ante, at 2114. Instead, it simply raises the bar for borderline unprotected speech with high social value (because of its proximity to public discourse) and low potential for injury (because public figures can engage in counterspeech).",Barrett,0,
2022-055,138,"Sullivan's rationale does not justify a heightened mens rea for true threats. Because true threats are not typically proximate to debate on matters of public concern, the Court's newly erected buffer zone does not serve the end of protecting heated political commentary. Nor can public figures use counterspeech in the public square to protect themselves from serious threats of physical violence. And perversely, private individuals now have less protection from true threats than from defamation —even though they presumably value their lives more than their reputations. See Gertz, 418 U.S. at 347-350, 94 S.Ct. 2997. The Court has therefore extended Sullivan in a way that makes no sense on Sullivan's own terms.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,139,"I will give the Court this much: Speakers must specifically intend to incite violence before they lose First Amendment  protection. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (per curiam) (defining incitement as advocacy  directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and likely to incite or produce such action), see also Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105, 108-109, 94 S.Ct. 326, 38 L.Ed.2d 303 (1973) (per curiam). Once more, however, our precedent itself explains the difference. Incitement, as a form of advocacy, often arises in the political arena. See Brandenburg, 395 U.S. at 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827 (Ku Klux Klan rally held to plan a `march on Congress'), Hess, 414 U.S. at 106, 94 S.Ct. 326 (antiwar demonstration), Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 620, 40 S.Ct. 17, 63 L.Ed. 1173 (1919) (pamphlets about the President's `shameful, cowardly silence about the intervention in Russia'). A specific intent requirement helps draw the line between incitement and political rhetoric lying at the core of the First Amendment. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 926-927, 102 S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982). The Court does not contend that targeted threats and political commentary share a similarly close relationship.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,140,"In sum, our First Amendment precedent does not set a baseline ban on an objective standard. Ante, at 2117. Precedent does more than allow an objective test for true threats, on balance, it affirmatively supports one.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,142,"The Court's analysis also gives short shrift to how an objective test works in practice. Two key features of true threats already guard against the risk of silencing protected speech. Thus, there is no need to go further and adopt the Court's heightened standard.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,143,"First, only a very narrow class of statements satisfies the definition of a true threat. To make a true threat, the speaker must express an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence. Black, 538 U.S. at 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536 (emphasis added). Speech that is merely offensive, `poorly chosen,' or unpopular does not qualify. Brief for Petitioner 31, 36, 42. The statement must also threaten violence to a particular individual or group of individuals —not just in general. Black, 538 U.S. at 359, 123 S.Ct. 1536. These tight guardrails distinguish true threats from public-figure defamation, the model for the Court's rule. While defamatory statements can cover an infinite number of topics, true threats target one: unlawful violence.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,144,"Second, the statement must be deemed threatening by a reasonable listener who is familiar with the entire factual context in which the statement occurs. State v. Taveras, 342 Conn. 563, 572, 271 A.3d 123, 129 (2022). This inquiry captures (among other things) the speaker's tone, the audience, the medium for the communication, and the broader exchange in which the statement occurs.3 Each consideration helps weed out protected speech from true threats.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,145,"Our decision in Black illustrates the point. There, the Court considered a Virginia law that prohibited cross burning  `with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons.' 538 U.S. at 348, 123 S.Ct. 1536. Notably, the statute included a presumption: `Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate.' Ibid. After three men were convicted under the statute, they challenged it as facially unconstitutional. We upheld the general prohibition on cross burning, concluding that the First Amendment allows the government to ban a particular type of threat. Id., at 362-363, 123 S.Ct. 1536. A plurality then went on to address the statutory presumption. While cross burning may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intimidation, the plurality reasoned, the act is not monolithic. Id., at 365, 123 S.Ct. 1536. Cross burning could be directed at an individual or at a group of like-minded believers, it could be done on a neighbor's lawn or at a public rally, it could be done with the property owner's permission or without it. Id., at 366, 123 S.Ct. 1536. The presumption blurred the line between these different situations and ignored all of the contextual factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning was covered by the statute or not.4 Id., at 365, 367, 123 S.Ct. 1536. Thus, the presumption was unconstitutionally overbroad.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,146,"The Black plurality's reasoning can be boiled down to the following insight: When context is ignored, true threats cannot be reliably distinguished from protected speech. The reverse also holds: When context is properly considered, constitutional concerns abate. See, e.g., Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per curiam) (concluding that a statement was political hyperbole instead of a true threat based on context, the expressly conditional nature of the statement, and the reaction of the listeners).",Barrett,0,
2022-055,147,"One more point: Many States have long had statutes like Colorado's on the books. See Brief for Illinois et al. as Amici Curiae 16-17. Before we took this case, the vast majority of Courts of Appeals and state high courts had upheld these statutes as constitutional. So objective tests are effectively the status quo today, yet Counterman still struggles to identify past prosecutions that came close to infringing on protected speech. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-30. The silence is telling.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,149,"So is the silence in the historical record. Since 1791, true threats have been excluded from the speech protected by the First Amendment. R. A.V., 505 U.S. at 382-383, 388, 112 S.Ct. 2538. If Counterman could show that a subjective requirement has been inherent in the definition of true threat since the founding, he would have a compelling case. But Counterman cannot make that showing.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,150,"For starters, he produces no evidence directly addressing the meaning of the First Amendment—nothing from state ratifying conventions, political commentary, or even early debates about efforts to regulate  threats in ways that might threaten speech. That is not surprising at the federal level, because the Federal Government did not prohibit threats until the early 20th century. Elonis, 575 U.S. at 760, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Some States, however, both regulated threats and guaranteed the right to free speech in their own constitutions. Id., at 760-761, 135 S.Ct. 2001. Yet even at the state level, there was apparently no discussion about the implications of these statutes for the constitutional right.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,151,"That void notwithstanding, the state threat statutes are the evidence on which Counterman seizes. He argues that they imposed a subjective mens rea, demonstrating that the founding generation thought that threats could be punished on no less. But as Justice THOMAS has already discussed in detail, this is incorrect. See id., at 760-765, 135 S.Ct. 2001. Rather than a subjective mens rea, these statutes used an objective standard resembling Colorado's.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,152,"Even if they did require a heightened mens rea, though, these statutes would not carry the day for Counterman. The enactment of a statute against the backdrop of a free speech guarantee tends to show that the legislature thought the statute consistent with that guarantee. Thus, if the question were whether such statutes violated the First Amendment, their existence would be evidence to the contrary. But the question here is whether a subjective intent requirement is the constitutional floor. And because the legislature is always free to exceed the floor, the enactment of legislation does not necessarily reflect the legislature's view of the constitutional minimum.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,153,"At the end of the day, then, the best historical case for Counterman does not add up to much. He is plainly not asking the Court to enforce a historically sanctioned rule, but rather to fashion a new one.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,155,"Even if a subjective test had a historical pedigree, the Court's chosen standard of recklessness certainly does not. Where does recklessness come from? It was not raised by the parties. Only the Solicitor General noted this possibility—and briefly at that. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28-31. Nor did the courts below address recklessness, indeed, very few courts (of the many that have taken up the question) have settled on recklessness as the constitutional floor for true threats. See, e.g., State v. Mrozinski, 971 N.W.2d 233, 243-245 (Minn. 2022), In re J. J. M., 265 A.3d 246, 269-270 (Pa. 2021). Still, the Court adopts recklessness as the right path forward. Ante, at 2117. Its rationale is, at best, unclear.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,156,"The Court begins by acknowledging the `competing values' of free expression on one hand, and profound harms to both individuals and society on the other. Ante, at 2117. But why do these considerations point to recklessness? A knowledge or purpose standard would allow more free expression, so maybe we should go higher. See ante, at 2127 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (chilling concerns only further buttress the conclusion that true threats should be limited to intentionally threatening speech). An objective standard would cause less harm to victims, so perhaps lower is better. The optimal balance strikes me as a question best left to the legislature, which could calibrate the mens rea to the circumstance—for example, higher for the criminal context and lower for the civil. See Brief for Illinois et al. as Amici Curiae 28-30 (States have a range of policy reasons for using subjective standards for penalizing threats of  violence and many choose to require proof of a speaker's subjective mental state in some situations but not others).",Barrett,0,
2022-055,157,"Nor does our First Amendment precedent buttress the Court's preferred standard. A recklessness requirement currently applies only to public-figure defamation claims. Incitement to violence calls for more. Fighting words, private-figure defamation, false commercial speech, and obscenity require less. I fail to see why, of all these categories of unprotected speech, public-figure defamation is the best analog for true threats. The reality is that recklessness is not grounded in law, but in a Goldilocks judgment: Recklessness is not too much, not too little, but instead just right.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,159,"Some may find Colorado's statute harsh, and the Court's decision seems driven in no small part by the heavy hammer of criminal punishment. See ante, at 2125-2126, ante, at 2126-2127, 2130-2131 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). While an objective test is a familiar feature of civil liability in tort law, the `conventional requirement for criminal conduct' is `awareness of some wrongdoing.' Elonis, 575 U.S. at 737-738, 135 S.Ct. 2001. In keeping with this convention, we generally presume that federal criminal statutes that are silent on the required mental state nonetheless impose the mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from otherwise innocent conduct. Id., at 736, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is why we rejected an objective standard for the federal threat prohibition, 18 U.S.C. § 875(c). 575 U.S. at 737-739, 135 S.Ct. 2001. It is the threatening nature of the communication that makes the conduct `wrongful', thus, the statute is best interpreted to require that the defendant be aware of the impact of his speech. Id., at 737, 135 S.Ct. 2001.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,160,"But this case is about the scope of the First Amendment, not the interpretation of a criminal statute. Accordingly, the Court's holding affects the civil consequences for true threats just as much as it restricts criminal liability. And the civil context underscores the danger of adopting a Sullivan-style buffer zone for true threats.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,161,"Consider, for example, threat victims who seek restraining orders to protect themselves from their harassers. See, e.g., United States v. Elonis, 841 F.3d 589, 593 (C.A.3 2016) (defendant's wife sought a restraining order after he wrote on Facebook, I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts). Civil orders can also keep individuals away from particular geographic areas. Imagine someone who threatens to bomb an airport, State v. Johnston, 156 Wash.2d 355, 358-359, 127 P.3d 707, 708-709 (2006), or shoot up a courthouse, State v. Draskovich, 2017 S.D. 76, ¶3, 904 N.W.2d 759, 761. The speaker might well end up barred from the location in question—for good reason. Yet after today, such orders cannot be obtained without proof—not necessarily easy to secure—that the person who issued the threat anticipated that it would elicit fear. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 92-93.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,162,"The government can also opt to counteract true threats by means of civil enforcement actions. For instance, 18 U.S.C. § 248 prohibits threats of force against any person obtaining or providing reproductive health services or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship. The statute imposes a range of civil penalties, and it allows enforcement suits by both private persons and government officials. See, e.g., United  States v. Dillard, 795 F.3d 1191, 1196-1197 (C.A.10 2015) (Government brought § 248 action after defendant warned a health provider, you will be checking under your car everyday—because maybe today is the day someone places an explosive under it), McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S. 464, 491, 134 S.Ct. 2518, 189 L.Ed.2d 502 (2014) (noting that several States have similar laws). After today, these civil enforcement actions face a higher constitutional hurdle.",Barrett,0,
2022-055,163,"In addition, employers and school administrators often discipline individuals who make true threats. Consider the student who was expelled after drafting two violent, misogynic, and obscenity-laden rants expressing a desire to molest, rape, and murder his ex-girlfriend. Doe v. Pulaski Cty. Special School Dist., 306 F.3d 616, 619 (C.A.8 2002) (en banc). Or the one who was suspended after `talking about taking a gun to school' to `shoot everyone he hates.' D. J. M. ex rel. D.M. v. Hannibal Public School Dist. No. 60, 647 F.3d 754, 758 (C.A.8 2011), Lovell v. Poway Unified School District, 90 F.3d 367, 369, 372-373 (C.A.9 1996) (similar), Haughwout v. Tordenti, 332 Conn. 559, 561-562, 211 A.3d 1, 3-4 (2019) (similar). True threats can also be expressed by a parent, a teacher, or an employee in another context altogether. See, e.g., Taveras, 342 Conn. at 567-569, 578, 271 A.3d at 126-128, 133 (parent), Smith v. New York City Dept. of Ed., 109 App.Div.3d 701, 702-703, 972 N.Y.S.2d 221, 222 (2013) (teacher), Diggs v.

A delusional speaker may lack awareness of the threatening nature of her speech, a devious speaker may strategically disclaim such awareness, and a lucky speaker may leave behind no evidence of mental state for the government to use against her. The Court's decision thus sweeps much further than it lets on.* * *",Barrett,0,

2022-056,30,"The Bankruptcy Code expressly abrogates the sovereign immunity of governmental units for specified purposes. 11 U.S.C. § 106(a). The question presented in this case is whether that express abrogation extends to federally recognized Indian tribes.

But for the reasons explained below, we find it has been satisfied here.",Jackson,0,

In 2019, one of the Band's businesses, Lendgreen, allowed respondent Brian Coughlin to borrow $1,100 in the form of a high-interest, short-term loan. But Coughlin filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy before he fully repaid the loan.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,33,"Under the Bankruptcy Code, Coughlin's filing of the bankruptcy petition triggered an automatic stay against further collection efforts by creditors, including Lendgreen. See § 362(a). Yet, according to Coughlin, Lendgreen continued its efforts to collect on his debt, even after it was reminded of the pending bankruptcy petition. Coughlin alleges that Lendgreen was so aggressive in its efforts to contact him and collect the money that he suffered substantial emotional distress, and at one point, even attempted to take his own life.",Jackson,0,

We have held that tribes possess the common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978). Our cases have thus repeatedly emphasized that tribal sovereign immunity, absent a clear statement of congressional intent to the contrary, is the baseline position. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 790, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,45,"This clear-statement rule is a demanding standard. If there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that preserves sovereign immunity, Congress has not unambiguously expressed the requisite intent. FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290, 132 S.Ct. 1441, 182 L.Ed.2d 497 (2012), accord, United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 37, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,46,"The rule is not a magic-words requirement, however. To abrogate sovereign immunity unambiguously, Congress need not state its intent in any particular way. Cooper, 566 U.S., at 291, 132 S.Ct. 1441. Nor need Congress make its clear statement in a single statutory section. Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,47,"62, 76, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000). The clear-statement question is simply whether, upon applying traditional tools of statutory interpretation, Congress's abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity is clearly discernable from the statute itself. Cooper, 566 U.S., at 291, 132 S.Ct. 1441.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,49,"We conclude that the Bankruptcy Code unequivocally abrogates the sovereign immunity of any and every government that possesses the power to assert such immunity. Federally recognized tribes undeniably fit that description, therefore, the Code's abrogation provision plainly applies to them as well.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,51,Several features of the provisions' text and structure compel this conclusion.,Jackson,0,
2022-056,52,"As an initial matter, the definition of governmental unit exudes comprehensiveness from beginning to end. Congress has rattled off a long list of governments that vary in geographic location, size, and nature. § 101(27) (including municipalities, districts, Territories, Commonwealths, States, the United States, and foreign states). The provision then proceeds to capture subdivisions and components of every government within that list. Ibid. (accounting for any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States , a State, a Commonwealth, a District, a Territory, a municipality, or a foreign state). And it concludes with a broad catchall phrase, sweeping in other foreign or domestic governments. Ibid.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,53,"When faced with analogously structured provisions in other contexts, we have noted their all-encompassing scope. See, e.g., Taylor v. United States, 579 U.S. 301, 305-306, 136 S.Ct. 2074, 195 L.Ed.2d 456 (2016) (characterizing as unmistakably broad a criminal statute defining commerce to include a list of specific instances in which the Federal Government would have jurisdiction, followed by a broad residual phrase), see also Marietta Memorial Hospital Employee Health Benefit Plan v. DaVita Inc., 596 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1, 142 S.Ct. 1968, 1973, n. 1, 213 L.Ed.2d 376 (2022) (similar). We find the strikingly broad scope of § 101(27)'s definition of governmental unit to be significant in this context as well.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,54,"The catchall phrase Congress used in § 101(27) is also notable in and of itself. Few phrases in the English language express all-inclusiveness more than the pairing of two extremes. Rain or shine is a classic example: If an event is scheduled to occur rain or shine, it will take place whatever the weather that day might be. Same with the phrase near and far: If people are traveling from near and far, they are coming from all over the map, regardless of the particular distance from point A to point B.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,55,"The pairing of foreign with domestic is of a piece with those other common expressions. For instance, if someone asks you to identify car manufacturers, foreign or domestic, your task is to name any and all manufacturers that come to mind, without particular regard to where exactly the cars are made or the location of the companies' headquarters. Similarly, at the start of each Congress, a cadre of newly elected officials `solemnly swear' to `support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.' 5 U.S.C. § 3331. That oath—which each Member of Congress who enacted the Bankruptcy Code took— indisputably pertains to enemies anywhere in the world. Accordingly, we find that, by coupling foreign and domestic together, and placing the pair at the end of an extensive list, Congress unmistakably intended  to cover all governments in § 101(27)'s definition, whatever their location, nature, or type.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,56,"It is also significant that the abrogation of sovereign immunity in § 106(a) plainly applies to all governmental units as defined by § 101(27). Congress did not cherry-pick certain governments from § 101(27)'s capacious list and only abrogate immunity with respect to those it had so selected. Nor did Congress suggest that, for purposes of § 106(a)'s abrogation of sovereign immunity, some types of governments should be treated differently than others. Instead, Congress categorically abrogated the sovereign immunity of any governmental unit that might attempt to assert it.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,58,Other aspects of the Bankruptcy Code reinforce what § 106(a)'s and § 101(27)'s plain text conveys.,Jackson,0,
2022-056,59,"Through various provisions, the Bankruptcy Code offers debtors a fresh start by discharging and restructuring their debts in an orderly and centralized fashion. See, e.g., 1 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶1.01 (16th ed. 2023), Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1752, 1758-1759, 201 L.Ed.2d 102 (2018). The automatic-stay requirement, for example, keeps creditors from dismembering the estate while the bankruptcy case proceeds. Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 585, 589, 208 L.Ed.2d 384 (2021), 11 U.S.C. § 362. The Code's discharge provision enjoins creditors from trying to collect debts that have been discharged in a bankruptcy case. § 524(a). And its plan-confirmation provisions, as relevant here, bind  each creditor to whatever repayment plan the bankruptcy court approves, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan. § 1327(a), see also, e.g., §§ 1141(a), 1227(a).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,60,"These protections sweep broadly, by their own terms. To facilitate the Code's orderly and centralized debtresolution process, Collier on Bankruptcy ¶1.01, these provisions' basic requirements generally apply to all creditors.2 Courts can also enforce these requirements against any kind of noncompliant creditor —whether or not the creditor is a governmental unit—by virtue of § 106(a)'s abrogation of sovereign immunity. §§ 106(a)(1)-(3).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,61,"At the same time, so as to avoid impeding the functioning of governmental entities when they act as creditors, the Code contains a number of limited exceptions. For instance, the automatic-stay requirement does not preclude governmental units from enforcing their police and regulatory powers in certain proceedings, § 362(b)(4), or from pursuing specific tax-related activities, §§ 362(b)(9), (18), (26). The Code additionally exempts from discharge certain debts for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture owed to a governmental unit. § 523(a)(7).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,62,"Reading the statute to carve out a subset of governments from the definition of  governmental unit, as petitioners' view of the statute would require, risks upending the policy choices that the Code embodies in this regard. That is, despite the fact that the Code generally subjects all creditors (including governmental units) to certain overarching requirements, under petitioners' reading, some government creditors would be immune from key enforcement proceedings while others would face penalties for their noncompliance. And while the Code is finely tuned to accommodate essential governmental functions (like tax administration and regulation) as a general matter, petitioners would have us find that certain governments are excluded from those provisions' reach, notwithstanding the fact that they engage in tax and regulatory activities too. There is no indication that Congress meant to categorically exclude certain governments from these provisions' enforcement mechanisms and exceptions, let alone in such an anomalous manner. Cf. Law v. Siegel, 571 U.S. 415, 424, 134 S.Ct. 1188, 188 L.Ed.2d 146 (2014) (declining to read into the Code an exception Congress did not include in its meticulous and carefully calibrated scheme).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,64,"Our conclusion that all government creditors are subject to abrogation under § 106(a) brings one remaining question to the fore—whether federally recognized tribes qualify as governments. Petitioners do not seriously dispute that federally recognized tribes are governments, and for good reason. Federally recognized tribes exercise uniquely governmental functions: They have power to make their own substantive law in internal matters, and to enforce that law in their own forums. Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S., at 55-56, 98 S.Ct. 1670 (citations omitted). They can also tax activities on the reservation. Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co., 554 U.S. 316, 327, 128 S.Ct. 2709, 171 L.Ed.2d 457 (2008).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,65,"It is thus no surprise that Congress has repeatedly characterized tribes as governments.3 And this Court has long recognized tribes' governmental status as well. See, e.g., Bay Mills, 572 U.S., at 788-789, 134 S.Ct. 2024, Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S., at 57-58, 98 S.Ct. 1670. We have done so generally and also in the specific context of tribal sovereign immunity. Tribal sovereign immunity, we have explained, is `a necessary corollary to Indian sovereignty and self-governance.' Bay Mills, 572 U.S., at 788, 134 S.Ct. 2024, see also id., at 789, 134 S.Ct. 2024 (discussing immunity as an example of tribes' governmental powers and attributes).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,66,"Putting the pieces together, our analysis of the question whether the Code abrogates the sovereign immunity of federally recognized tribes is remarkably straightforward. The Code unequivocally abrogates the sovereign immunity of all governments, categorically. Tribes are indisputably governments. Therefore, § 106(a) unmistakably abrogates their  sovereign immunity too.4",Jackson,0,
2022-056,68,Petitioners raise two main arguments in an attempt to sow doubt into these clear statutory provisions. Neither creates the ambiguity petitioners seek.,Jackson,0,
2022-056,70,"For their opening salvo, petitioners try to make hay out of the simple fact that neither § 101(27) nor § 106(a) mentions Indian tribes by name. Had Congress wanted to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity, petitioners claim, the most natural and obvious way to have expressed that intent would have been to reference Indian tribes specifically, rather than smuggle them into a broadly worded catchall phrase.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,71,"But, as explained at the outset, supra, at 1695-1696, the clear-statement rule is not a magic-words requirement. Thus, Congress did not have to include a specific reference to federally recognized tribes in order to make clear that it intended for tribes to be covered by the abrogation provision. As long as Congress speaks unequivocally, it passes the clear-statement test—regardless of whether it articulated its intent in the most straightforward way. Cooper, 566 U.S., at 291, 132 S.Ct. 1441.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,72,"Trying a different tack, petitioners point to historical practice. In statute after statute, they say, Congress has specifically mentioned Indian tribes when abrogating their sovereign immunity. And in no case has this Court ever found an abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity where the statute did not reference Indian tribes explicitly. See Brief for Petitioners 24-26.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,73,"These statistics sound quite noteworthy at first glance. But they do not move the needle in this case. For one thing, none of petitioners' cited examples involved a statutory provision that was worded analogously to, and structured like, the ones at issue here.5 Moreover, the universe of cases in which we have addressed federal statutes abrogating tribal sovereign immunity is exceedingly slim.6",Jackson,0,
2022-056,74,"In any event, the fact that Congress has referenced tribes specifically in some statutes abrogating tribal sovereign immunity does not foreclose it from using different language to accomplish that same goal in other statutory contexts. Even petitioners appear to concede this basic point. They agree that Congress could have used a phrase like every government or any  government with sovereign immunity to express unambiguously the requisite intent to abrogate the sovereign immunity of tribes. Id., at 27 (internal quotation marks omitted). For the reasons discussed above, we believe Congress did just that.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,76,"Petitioners further contend that even if the relevant provisions could theoretically cover tribes, the statute can plausibly be read in a way that preserves their immunity.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,78,"According to petitioners, the catchall phrase other foreign or domestic government might simply capture entities created through interstate compacts, which cannot neatly be characterized as a State or an instrumentality of a State under § 101(27)'s enumerated list. Id., at 40-41 (internal quotation marks omitted). Interpreted in that fashion, petitioners maintain, the catchall phrase would exclude governmental entities that are not purely foreign or purely domestic—like tribes or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,79,"If this interpretation of the statute sounds far-fetched, that is because it is. To find petitioners' construction plausible, we would have to interpret other foreign or domestic government to impose a rigid division between foreign governments on the one hand and domestic governments on the other, leaving out any governmental entity that may have both foreign and domestic characteristics (like tribes or the IMF). But Congress has expressly instructed that the word or, as used in the Code, is not exclusive. 11 U.S.C. § 102(5). As a result, we have serious doubts that Congress meant for § 101(27) to elicit the laser focus on or that petitioners' reading of foreign or domestic would entail.7",Jackson,0,
2022-056,80,"The dissent's own arguments undermine any suggestion that Congress adopted such a siloed view. For instance, the dissent repeatedly paints tribes as occupying a hybrid position between foreign and domestic, post, at 1706-1707, 1707-1708 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.), and posits that Territories historically share this hybrid status as well, post, at 1708-1709 (describing Territories as tribes' close comparator). Yet, as the dissent readily acknowledges, Congress expressly included Territories within § 101(27)'s definition of governmental unit. If, on the dissent's own account, Territories are neither foreign nor domestic, ibid.—and fall within § 101(27)'s purview nevertheless—it is hard to see how § 101(27)'s catchall phrase would simultaneously exclude other entities that share that same feature. § 101(27) (`governmental unit' means  United States, State,  Territory,  foreign state, or other foreign or domestic government (emphasis added)).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,81,"In any case, neither petitioners nor the dissent explain why the Code would draw such a line in the sand. None of the carefully calibrated exceptions noted in Part III-B, supra, for governmental units performing regulatory and tax-related functions turn on whether a government is purely foreign or domestic. Likewise, it is hard to see why the Code would subject purely foreign or domestic governments to enforcement proceedings while at the same time immunizing government creditors that have both foreign and domestic attributes. Considering that the one thing every entity in § 101(27)'s enumerated list has in common is its governmental nature—and that is the same characteristic that matters when the Code addresses governmental units from one provision to the next8—we are highly skeptical that Congress distinguished between governments in the way petitioners suggest.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,83,"Undaunted, petitioners note that Congress has historically treated various types of governments differently for purposes of bankruptcy law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15, Reply Brief 21. They assert that, in the decades leading up to the Bankruptcy Code's enactment, bankruptcy law afforded certain benefits to `the United States or any State or any subdivision thereof,' leaving out entities that did not fall into one of those enumerated categories. Reply Brief 21 (quoting § 64(a)(4), 52 Stat. 874).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,84,"Even if petitioners' understanding of this history is correct, they have failed to demonstrate that the Code carried forward any such differential treatment. Congress ushered in a new, unprecedented era in bankruptcy practice when it enacted the Code in 1978. 1 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice § 1:9, p. 1-17 (3d ed. 2023), Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 52-53, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982) (plurality opinion) (describing the Code as a comprehensive revision of the bankruptcy laws). Both § 101(27)'s definition of governmental unit and § 106(a)'s abrogation of sovereign immunity were some of the many changes Congress made. The prior statute did not provide a general definition for governmental entities, much less include any provision expressly abrogating governments' sovereign immunity. Instead, it set forth a general definition for States, which encompassed Territories, possessions, and the District of Columbia. 52 Stat. 842. Then, in each provision where governmental entities were relevant, Congress specified the particular governmental entities to which that provision pertained. See, e.g., § 17(1), id., at 851 (exempting from discharge debts due as a tax levied by the United States, or any State, county, district, or municipality), id., at 874 (providing priority status to the United States or any State or any subdivision thereof).",Jackson,0,
2022-056,85,"Section 101(27)'s definition of governmental unit has an undeniably broader reach than the statutory provisions that preceded it. Section 101(27)'s definition includes, for instance, foreign countries and  instrumentalities, when such entities had generally been previously absent. And the expansive definition of governmental unit in § 101(27) applies throughout the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, for those who find legislative history useful, the Senate and House Reports that accompanied the Code indicate that governmental unit was intended to be defined in the broadest sense. S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 24 (1978), H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 311 (1977). When Congress later added § 106(a)'s abrogation provision, it was that comprehensive definition of governmental unit that Congress used to specify the scope of the abrogation's sweep.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,86,"Thus, however Congress may have treated governmental entities in bankruptcy law prior to 1978, it had clearly altered its view about the scope of coverage relative to governments by the time it enacted § 101(27) and § 106(a). Those provisions unequivocally extend to all governments, for the reasons already discussed, and we decline to read ambiguity into the statute where none exists.* * *",Jackson,0,
2022-056,87,"We find that the First Circuit correctly concluded that the Bankruptcy Code unambiguously abrogates tribal sovereign immunity. Therefore, the decision below is affirmed.",Jackson,0,
2022-056,88,It is so ordered.,Jackson,0,
2022-056,89,"Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,90,"As I have explained, to the extent that tribes possess sovereign immunity at all, that immunity does not extend to suits arising out of a tribe's commercial activities conducted beyond its territory. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 815, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014) (dissenting opinion). Because respondent's stay-enforcement motion arose from petitioners' off-reservation commercial conduct, petitioners lack sovereign immunity regardless of the Bankruptcy Code's abrogation provision. I therefore concur in the Court's judgment.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,91,"Tribal immunity is a judicial doctrine that is not mandated by the Constitution, developed almost by accident, was reiterated with little analysis, and does not reflect the realities of modern-day Indian tribes. Upper Skagit Tribe v. Lundgren, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1649, 1662, 200 L.Ed.2d 931 (2018) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent that tribes have any sovereign immunity at all, it is a common-law immunity. Bay Mills, 572 U.S., at 816-817, 134 S.Ct. 2024. Unlike the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States under the Constitution, common-law immunity is not a freestanding right that applies of its own force when a sovereign faces suit in the courts of another. Id., at 816, 134 S.Ct. 2024 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, it normally depends on the second sovereign's law as a matter of comity. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Because no federal law accords tribes sovereign immunity in federal court, petitioners lack immunity in this federal case.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,92,"Moreover, even if federal courts could afford immunity to tribes as a matter of comity, comity considerations would not help petitioners. Even with respect to fully sovereign foreign nations, comity has long been discarded as a sufficient reason to grant immunity for commercial acts— like those at issue here. Id., at 817, 134 S.Ct. 2024 (emphasis added). And, far from furthering comity principles, recognizing immunity for off-reservation commercial acts represents a substantial affront to a different set of sovereigns—the States. Ibid. When a tribe engages in off-reservation commercial activity, it necessarily  acts within the territory of a sovereign State. Id., at 818, 134 S.Ct. 2024. Thus, to grant tribes a unique and unjustified immunity from both federal and state jurisdiction for commercial acts committed on a State's territory aggravates relationships between States and tribes throughout the country. Id., at 818-819, 134 S.Ct. 2024. Accordingly, any common-law immunity that petitioners possess cannot support their claim to immunity in federal court for their off-reservation commercial conduct.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,93,"The Court's tribal immunity doctrine is also out of step with more recent decisions. In Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1485, 203 L.Ed.2d 768 (2019), the Court recognized that the 50 States possess a unique form of immunity that applies of its own force in the courts of sister States, id., at ___, 139 S.Ct. at 1493-1499, as well as those of the Federal Government, id., at ___, 139 S.Ct. at 1496 (collecting cases). This immunity stems from the Constitution itself and belongs only to the 50 States through their ratification of the Constitution or admission to the Union on an equal footing with the original States. See Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). As a result, it is distinct from common-law immunity, which depends upon the forum court's sovereign for recognition. Bay Mills, 572 U.S., at 816, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071. By treating tribal immunity like state immunity, the Court's tribal immunity case law has afforded tribes, by judicial fiat, a form of immunity that the Constitution accords to the 50 States, and only the 50 States.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,94,"Finally, this Court's tribal immunity doctrine continues to artificially exempt tribes from generally applicable laws. I warned nearly a decade ago that tribal immunity will continue to invite problems, including de facto deregulation of highly regulated activities, unfairness to tort victims, and increasingly fractious relations with States and individuals alike. Id., at 825, 134 S.Ct. 2024. This is a case in point. In order to avoid state payday loan regulation, payday lenders  often arrange to share fees or profits with tribes so they can use tribal immunity as a shield for conduct of questionable legality. Ibid. Petitioners here rely on tribal immunity to avoid not only state but also federal payday loan regulation. They further seek to leverage this immunity to pursue respondent on his debt while other creditors' collection efforts are stayed. Tribal immunity thus creates a pathway to circumvent vast swaths of both state and federal laws.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,95,"The consequences of the Court's erroneous tribal immunity precedents have only gotten worse over the years. See id., at 814, 134 S.Ct. 2024 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (I am now convinced that Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751, 118 S.Ct. 1700, 140 L.Ed.2d 981 (1998) was wrongly decided, that, in the intervening 16 years, its error has grown more glaringly obvious, and that stare decisis does not recommend its retention), id., at 831, 134 S.Ct. 2024 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (This Court's declaration of an immunity thus absolute was and remains exorbitant). Further, the doctrine simply cannot be reconciled with the Court's precedents affirming that the States have legislative jurisdiction over the off-reservation conduct of Indian tribes, and even over some on-reservation activities. Kiowa, 523 U.S., at 762, 118 S.Ct. 1700, 140 L.Ed.2d 981 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (describing the Court's prior cases). Rather than accepting the flawed premise of tribal immunity and deciding the abrogation question beyond the looking glass, the Court should simply abandon its judicially created tribal sovereign immunity doctrine.",Thomas,0,
2022-056,96,"Justice GORSUCH, dissenting.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,97,"Until today, there was not one example in all of history where this Court had found that Congress intended to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity without expressly mentioning Indian tribes somewhere in the statute. In re Greektown Holdings, LLC, 917 F.3d 451, 460 (CA6 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). No longer. The Court reads the phrase other foreign or domestic government, 11 U.S.C. § 101(27), as synonymous with any and every government, ante, at 1695-1696— all for the purpose of holding that § 106(a) of the Bankruptcy Code abrogates tribal sovereign immunity. It is a plausible interpretation. But plausible is not the standard our tribal immunity jurisprudence demands. Before holding that Congress has vitiated tribal immunity, the Legislature must unequivocally express its intent to achieve that result. C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 532 U.S. 411, 418, 121 S.Ct. 1589, 149 L.Ed.2d 623 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,98,"Respectfully, I do not think the language here does the trick. The phrase other foreign or domestic government could mean what the Court suggests: every government, everywhere. But it could also mean what it says: every other foreign government, every other  domestic government. And properly understood, Tribes are neither of those things. Instead, the Constitution's text— and two centuries of history and precedent —establish that Tribes enjoy a unique status in our law. Because this reading of the statute is itself (at worst) a plausible one, I would hold that the Bankruptcy Code flunks this Court's clear-statement rule and reverse.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,100,"As the Court reaffirms today, the doctrine of tribal immunity is settled law. Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v.

Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 322, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978), Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 559, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,101,"A necessary corollary to that Indian sovereignty is immunity from private suit. Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U.S. 877, 890, 106 S.Ct. 2305, 90 L.Ed.2d 881 (1986). It is, after all, inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). That understanding, derived from both common law sovereign immunity and law-of-nations sovereign immunity, is a background principle on which the Constitution itself rests. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U. S. ___, ___- ___, 139 S.Ct. 1485, 1493-1495, 203 L.Ed.2d 768 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing authorities). And it applies to Tribes no less than foreign nations, Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978), a tradition that traces back over 170 years, see Parks v. Ross, 11 How. 362, 374, 13 L.Ed. 730 (1851). See also W. Wood, It Wasn't an Accident: The Tribal Sovereign Immunity Story, 62 Am. U. L. Rev. 1587, 1640 (2013) (Wood).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,102,"While venerable, tribal immunity—like its state and foreign counterparts—is not immutable. The federal government can abrogate it, at least as far as its fonts of power let it. See Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S., at 58-59, 98 S.Ct. 1670, cf. Brackeen, 599 U. S., at ___, 143 S.Ct. at 1657 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). But the choice to abrogate tribal immunity is fundamentally political in nature. It is a choice that therefore belongs to Congress, the department which can modify the law at will, and not the Judiciary, the department which can pursue only the law as it is written. Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch 110, 129, 12 U.S. 110, 3 L.Ed. 504 (1814) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court). Recognizing the Constitution's division of responsibility, this Court has long left all decisions about tribal and other sorts of sovereign immunity in Congress's hands. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 789, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,103,"Because erroneous abrogations of immunity risk inter-sovereign conflicts and reprisals, this Court employs an additional interpretive guardrail—a clear statement requirement designed to ensure that the political branches acted knowingly and intentionally in divesting sovereigns of their legal entitlements. A. Bellia & B. Clark, The Law of Nations as Constitutional Law, 98 Va. L. Rev. 729, 792-793 (2012). Under this approach, we will not read a statute to abrogate immunity if any other possible construction remains. Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118, 6 U.S. 64, 2 L.Ed. 208 (1804), see also, e.g., Financial Oversight and Management Bd. for P. R. v. Centro De Periodismo Investigativo, Inc., 598 U. S. ___, ___, 143 S.Ct. 1176, 1180-1181, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023). That goes for Tribes just as it goes for other sovereigns, it is an enduring principle of Indian law that we will not lightly assume that Congress in fact intends to undermine Indian sovereignty absent pellucid evidence to the contrary. Bay Mills, 572 U.S., at 790, 134 S.Ct. 2024.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,104,"All this explains the now-familiar clear-statement rule that this Court has endorsed on countless occasions. If Congress wishes to abrogate tribal immunity, its decision must be clear. Ibid. And the Legislature must unequivocally express its decision in the text of a statute. C & L Enterprises, 532 U.S., at 418, 121 S.Ct. 1589 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under that rule, any ambiguities in the statutory language are to be construed in favor of immunity. FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290, 132 S.Ct. 1441, 182 L.Ed.2d 497 (2012). Keep that hard-to-meet standard in mind. We will return to it as we make our way through the statutory text driving today's dispute.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,106,"The Bankruptcy Code stipulates that, notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity, sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section. § 106(a). That language, this Court has previously held, signals a clear intent to abrogate sovereign immunity. See Central Va. Community College v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 379, 126 S.Ct. 990, 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006). But as to which sovereigns? The answer to that question lies elsewhere in the Bankruptcy Code. The term `governmental unit,' it says, means United States, State, Commonwealth, District, Territory, municipality, foreign state, department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States (but not a United States trustee while serving as a trustee in a case under this title), a State, a Commonwealth, a District, a Territory, a municipality, or a foreign state, or other foreign or domestic government. § 101(27).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,107,"That is a lot of words. For present purposes, however, only the last five matter: other foreign or domestic government. No one argues any of the other clauses could potentially refer to Tribes. We can further winnow down the options from there. No one thinks Tribes qualify as foreign  governments. That leaves only two possibilities. Tribes could qualify as `domestic governments'—respondent's lead argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Or the phrase other foreign or domestic government, read as a whole, could mean any and every government—respondent's backup argument and the one the Court adopts today. Ante, at 1695-1696. Neither possibility is the slam dunk our familiar clear-statement rule requires. Consider each in turn.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,109,"Start with the domestic government possibility. At the time Congress adopted the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code at issue before us, the word domestic carried only two potentially relevant meanings. It could mean spatially domestic— i.e., within the territorial confines of the United States. Or it could mean politically domestic—i.e., a subpart of the United States. Contemporary definitions support each of those possibilities and only those possibilities. See, e.g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 581 (2d ed. 1987) (of or pertaining to one's own or a particular country as apart from other countries), American Heritage Dictionary 416 (2d College ed. 1982) (of or pertaining to a country's internal affairs).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,110,"If we were to read the term only in its spatial sense, as the First Circuit did below and respondent urges us to do, it makes some sense to speak of Tribes as domestic. See In re Coughlin, 33 F.4th 600, 606 (2022). These days, tribal jurisdiction usually falls within the United States' territorial bounds—although that was not true for most of the Nation's history, and became so only after the West was won. M. Fletcher, Tribal Consent, 8 Stan. J. Civ. Rights & Civ. Lib. 45, 55, n. 63 (2012). Of course, usually does not mean always. Even to this day, all three branches of government struggle to address the status of Tribes that straddle our Nation's borders. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1359 (setting special immigration rules for American Indians born in Canada), 22 C.F.R. § 42.1(f) (2022) (similar), Matter of Yellowquill, 16 I. & N. Dec. 576, 577-578 (BIA 1978) (interpreting other provisions to not apply to Canada-born American Indians), Akins v. Saxbe, 380 F.Supp. 1210, 1218-1222 (D.Me. 1974) (similar). Evidently, our neighbor to the north has encountered similar difficulties. See R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17 (analyzing traditional cross-border hunting rights).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,111,"Focusing only on the spatial meaning of domestic, however, would miss an obvious point. When it comes to the status of governments, this Court has long recognized that geography takes a backseat. Whether a government qualifies as domestic instead usually depends on the political relation in which one government or country stands to another, the term has no relation to local, geographical, or territorial position. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 55, 8 L.Ed. 25 (1831) (Thompson, J., dissenting), see also id., at 16-20 (Marshall, C. J., for the Court). At minimum, this line of thinking leaves open a reasonable possibility that Congress in § 101(27) meant the term domestic in its political (not geographic) sense. Accordingly, for respondent's primary argument to succeed, he must show that the political relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States is such that the term domestic government clearly covers them.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,112,"That is a burden respondent cannot carry. Properly understood, Indian Tribes occupy a unique status that is neither politically foreign nor domestic. National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845, 851, 105 S.Ct. 2447, 85 L.Ed.2d 818 (1985). Significant evidence supports this understanding. Start with the text of the Constitution. Its terms appear to place Indian Tribes in an intermediate category between foreign and domestic states. Z. Price, Dividing Sovereignty in Tribal and Territorial Criminal Jurisdiction, 113 Colum. L. Rev. 657, 670 (2013) (Price). At least two provisions illustrate as much. One is the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. The inclusion of that third Commerce Clause power suggests that Tribes were not reachable either by Congress's foreign commerce power or by its domestic (interstate) commerce power. More obscure but no less probative is the Constitution's exemption from the apportionment formula of all Indians not taxed. Art. I, § 2, cl. 3, Amdt. 14, § 2. That choice recognizes that Tribes are not fully domestic to the United States, and instead stand separate from the polity. Price 670.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,113,"These provisions, too, reflected a widely shared understanding about the sovereign status of Tribes at the founding. As Secretary of War Henry Knox put it in a letter to President Washington, the Tribes were in many ways akin to foreign nations, and not part of any particular State. Letter to G. Washington (July 7, 1789), in 3 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 134, 138 (D. Twohig ed. 1989). Consistent with this understanding, before 1871 the United States (and, prior to that, Great Britain) chiefly managed tribal relations by way of treaty. Entering into those treaties admitted that the Tribes rank among those powers who are capable of making treaties. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 559. Governments do not normally deal with politically domestic authorities in that manner. See, e.g., Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556, 572, 3 S.Ct. 396, 27 L.Ed. 1030 (1883) (linking Tribes' `capacity to make treaties' with their unique `semi-independent' status, allowing them to control `their domestic government' (quoting United States v. Joseph, 94 U.S. 614, 617, 24 L.Ed. 295 (1877))), The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 622, 78 U.S. 616, 20 L.Ed. 227 (1871) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (similar).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,114,"This Court's earliest Indian-law jurisprudence offers more evidence along the same lines. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, three distinct views of tribal sovereignty emerged on the question whether, for purposes of Article III, the Cherokee Nation was a foreign nation. R. Tsosie, Tribalism, Constitutionalism, and Cultural Pluralism: Where Do Indigenous Peoples Fit Within Civil Society?, 5 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 357, 360-361 (2003). In the lead opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall emphasized that the condition of the Indians in relation to the United States is perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence. 5 Pet. at 16. For the limited purposes of Article III, Chief Justice Marshall rejected the view that the Tribes could, with strict accuracy, be denominated foreign nations. Id., at 17 (emphasis added). Instead, he suggested, they may, more correctly, perhaps, be denominated domestic dependent nations. Ibid. (emphasis added). But notably, he did not describe the Tribes as domestic for all purposes. To the contrary, he deliberately chose the term nations, stressing also that in the general, nations not owing a common allegiance are foreign to each other. Id., at 16. In that way, he  said, the relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else. Ibid. Read in context, the term domestic dependent nations is really a term of art meant to capture Tribes' hybrid position between foreign and domestic states. Price 670.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,115,"The remaining opinions in Cherokee Nation underscore this message. Justice Johnson, concurring, rejected the moniker foreign state. 5 Pet. at 27. But he also thought it very clear that the Constitution neither speaks of Tribes as States or foreign states, but as just what they were, Indian Tribes, an anomaly unknown to the books. Ibid. Justice Baldwin, also concurring, rejected the idea that Tribes were states, foreign or domestic. Id., at 43 (emphasis added). And Justice Thompson, joined by Justice Story, dissented on the grounds that he thought the Cherokee had a chiefly foreign character, all things considered. Id., at 55. All told, this Court split sharply as to the best way to characterize the legal status of Tribes in relation to the United States. But if there is one thing all Members of the Court could have agreed on, perhaps it would be this: Neither the term foreign government nor the term domestic government adequately captures the Tribes' unique legal and political status.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,116,"This Court's later decisions only give further reason to doubt that Tribes are clearly domestic governments. No less than this Court's first case analyzing tribal sovereign immunity, Parks v. Ross, rested on the view that each Tribe remains in many respects (but not all) a foreign and independent nation. 11 How. at 374 (emphasis added), see Wood 1640 (describing Parks as the first case of record involving tribal immunity). That language not only weighs against treating Tribes as domestic governments. It does so in precisely the context at issue here—sovereign immunity. If we can assume that Congress is aware of this Court's relevant precedents, the notion that the Bankruptcy Code abrogates tribal sovereign immunity is sunk. Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1929, 1940, 213 L.Ed.2d 221 (2022). That seems like an especially safe assumption here, given that Congress adopted its most recent version of § 106 after this Court—twice—held that the provision failed our clear-statement rule as to other sovereigns. See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33-39, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992), Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96, 98-104, 109 S.Ct. 2818, 106 L.Ed.2d 76 (1989) (plurality opinion). That the respondent in this case nowhere discussed Parks in his briefing (and had nothing to say about it at argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 43) speaks volumes.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,117,"Of course, respondent has bigger problems than just the words this Court has used. He must contend with the reality of this Court's Indian-law jurisprudence, which in practice has consistently treated Tribes as a constitutional hybrid, resembling States in certain respects and foreign nations in others. Price 670-671, see generally G. Ablavsky, Sovereign Metaphors in Indian Law, 80 Mont. L. Rev. 11 (2019). For example, while Congress has certain legislative authority over tribal lands, the Tribes themselves need not abide by the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment. See Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 194, n. 3, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978) (citing Talton v. Mayes, 163 U.S. 376, 16 S.Ct. 986, 41 L.Ed. 196 (1896)). Instead, they are governed by unique regimes of civil and criminal jurisdiction involving overlapping federal, tribal, and state authorities unlike those employed anywhere else. Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, 597 U. S. ___,  ___, and n. 3, 142 S.Ct. 2486, 2512, and n. 3, 213 L.Ed.2d 847 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). And their unique character makes their brand of sovereign immunity not congruent with the immunity other sovereigns enjoy. Three Affiliated Tribes, 476 U.S., at 890, 106 S.Ct. 2305.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,118,"Nor are Tribes alone in standing outside the foreign/domestic dichotomy. Take the Court's treatment of the so-called Insular Territories. It depends entirely on the idea that those Territories are neither foreign nor domestic, but instead unique entities foreign to the United States, in a domestic sense. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 341, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088 (1901) (White, J., concurring), see also C. Burnett & B. Marshall, Between the Foreign and the Domestic: The Doctrine of Territorial Incorporation, Invented and Reinvented 30, n. 3, in Foreign in a Domestic Sense: Puerto Rico, American Expansion, and the Constitution (2001) (noting that the Court has unanimously and expressly adopted that view). No one could accuse me of having fondness for the Insular Cases. See United States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1539, 1541, 212 L.Ed.2d 496 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., concurring). But their existence is fatal for respondent's theory. After all, the Insular Territories are a close comparator to Tribes and many have considered both Tribes and Territories to share the same status as `foreign to the United States, in a domestic sense.' H. Babock, A Possible Solution to the Problem of Diminishing Tribal Sovereignty, 90 N. D. L. Rev. 13, 57 (2014). Tellingly, too, Congress expressly abrogated any immunity Territories may enjoy under the Bankruptcy Code. § 101(27). Yet it did no such thing when it came to the Tribes.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,119,"Respondent has no real answer to any of this. He cites some cases in which this Court reprised the domestic dependent nations language from Cherokee Nation. See Brief for Respondent 21 (citing cases). But as we have seen, that language actually stands for a view of Tribes flatly inconsistent with the domestic government characterization. Taking away those examples leaves respondent with thin gruel. He directs us to United States v. Coxe, 18 How. 100, 103, 59 U.S. 100, 15 L.Ed. 299 (1856). But that case observed only that Cherokee territory counts as domestic territory. Ibid. (emphases added). The decision thus plainly used the term domestic only in its spatial sense. The same goes for Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991). There, this Court recognized that Tribes are only in some respects more like States than foreign sovereigns. Id., at 782, 111 S.Ct. 2578. Read with this context in mind, its statement that they are, for example, domestic, referred only to their spatial location. Ibid. Confirming this point, the rest of the paragraph contrasted the Tribes' physical domesticity with features of their political relationship with the United States. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,120,"More fundamentally, even granting respondent these examples would not do him any good. Just think of the balancing task we would face. On one side of the scale, we would have a couple of scattered quotes (cherry-picked from over two centuries of Indian-law jurisprudence) bandying about the word domestic when describing certain features of Tribes. On the other side of the scale, we would have the text and history of the Constitution, supported by more (and better) examples of this Court's jurisprudence fashioning rules of law treating Tribes as sui generis. Faced with all that countervailing authority, the best respondent could realistically hope for is that we declare § 101(27) a jump ball. And under our clear-statement rule, a jump ball is as good as a possession arrow favoring  the party opposing the abrogation of sovereign immunity.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,122,"Taking the domestic government possibility off the table leaves only one other. Respondent falls back on the idea that foreign or domestic is really just shorthand for every government under the Sun. The Court relies solely on this reading, holding that § 102(27) unequivocally abrogates the sovereign immunity of any and every government that possesses the power to assert such immunity. Ante, at 1696. Getting to that conclusion from the statutory text requires two interpretive moves. First, the reader must treat the words foreign or domestic as a single, undifferentiated clause (rather than as a disjunctive grouping of descriptors). Second, the reader must take that undifferentiated clause to mean anywhere and everywhere. Each move is plausible, neither is clear. And a problem with either is game over.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,123,"Start with the first move. Respondent would have us read foreign or domestic as a unitary clause expressing a single, shared idea. This is what linguists might call a hendiadys—two terms separated by a conjunction that work together as a single complex expression. S. Bray, Necessary and Proper and Cruel and Unusual: Hendiadys in the Constitution, 102 Va. L. Rev. 687, 688 (2016). On occasion, English employs that sort of construct. But those occasions are the exceptions, not the rule. Nor is it clear that is what we have here. As even respondent concedes, or in its ordinary use instead indicates that `the words it connects are to be given separate meanings.' Brief for Respondent 23 (quoting United States v. Woods, 571 U.S. 31, 45-46, 134 S.Ct. 557, 187 L.Ed.2d 472 (2013)). A perfectly natural reading, then, would ask whether Tribes clearly qualify as foreign  governments or as domestic governments. And because the answer is no on both scores (for the reasons already laid out above) the language flunks the clear-statement rule.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,124,"The second move has issues too. The case for treating foreign or domestic government as synonymous with any government anywhere rests on the premise that the terms are two extremes, so that—by invoking both—Congress meant to cover every part of an all-inclusive spectrum. Ante, at 1696. The Court analogizes to the phrase near and far, which it argues sometimes means all over the map. Ante, at 1696-1697. But the premise here is faulty and the analogy inapt. Near and far may well be two extremes —one would not speak of a location being both near and far at the same time, for example. When it comes to sovereigns, however, the terms foreign and domestic do not share that same quality. Rather, as we have seen, an extensive tradition supports treating certain sovereigns —Tribes among them—as sui generis entities falling outside the foreign/domestic dichotomy. That tradition is fatal under the clear-statement rule.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,125,"How does respondent contend with this problem? At argument, he retreated from his briefing and relied instead on a provision of the Bankruptcy Code stating that, for purposes of that Code, `or' is not exclusive. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (citing § 102(5)). From this, respondent reasoned, the Bankruptcy Code abrogates tribal immunity because everyone can agree at least that Tribes bear some qualities of both foreign and domestic governments.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,126,"The provision respondent cites simply does not do what he seems to think it does. In common usage, the term or can carry two meanings. The first is exclusive. It requires full satisfaction of one—and exactly  one—listed condition. The second is inclusive. It requires full satisfaction of at least one listed condition. All § 102(5) does is favor the latter meaning for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Sound complicated? Just look at an example. Suppose you tell your child that he can get a pet so long as it is small or a dog. The child can choose a small animal (like a hamster) or a large dog (like a mastiff). But can the child also choose a small dog? If the or is inclusive (as respondent argues it is here), the answer is yes. If it is exclusive, the answer is no. Critically, however, neither reading covers a medium-sized aardvark. Such an animal may be somewhat small and somewhat doglike, but two near misses do not add up to a hit. This is a simple point but an important one. Regardless of whether or is used inclusively or exclusively, one of the input conditions must be satisfied.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,127,"With this point in mind, respondent's reading collapses. To see why, consider another example. Suppose you are a houseguest, and your host invites you to help yourself to the chocolate or vanilla ice cream in the freezer. Upon opening the freezer, you find three tubs—vanilla, chocolate, and Neapolitan. For argument's sake, too, let's say the last tub also has a sticky note: Do not eat without clear permission. Which ice cream can you take? If the host meant or exclusively, you may take either chocolate or vanilla, not both. If the host meant it inclusively, you may scoop some of each. In neither event, however, would you have permission to take the Neapolitan ice cream—especially given the cautionary note. As a unique composite, it does not clearly satisfy either of the necessary conditions. So too here. Tribes may have some features of both domestic and foreign governments, but they do not clearly qualify as either, and they have some features found in neither. Accordingly, § 102(5) does nothing to rescue respondent's cause.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,128,"If anything, § 102(5) only sheds light on what the catchall term other foreign or domestic government does cover. That phrase sweeps up, as Chief Judge Barron explained in dissent below, certain otherwise excluded, half-fish, half-fowl governmental entities like authorities or commissions that are created through interstate compacts (`other  domestic governments') and the joint products of international agreements (`other foreign  governments'). 33 F.4th at 615. Without the catchall, entities of these sorts could potentially fall through the cracks. Tribes, by contrast, are among the most significant entities wielding sovereign immunity. They are a unique form of government— and they alone are nowhere mentioned.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,129,"The Court offers two responses. Above the line, it asks why Territories are encompassed within § 101(27)'s immunity-abrogation provision if they share the same status of Tribes—neither foreign nor domestic. Ante, at 1700-1701. The answer, of course, is that Congress expressly listed Territories, it did not do the same for Tribes. Nor do I see how Congress's choice to include Territories supports the Court's suggestion that the term other foreign or domestic government clearly covers all governments. To the contrary, under the Court's interpretation of that term, the express inclusion of Territories becomes curious surplusage. And to the extent the Court thinks Congress mentioned Territories just to be doubly clear that the term other foreign or domestic government really does cover all governments —adopting a kind of belt-and-suspenders approach—isn't it odd that Congress left one of the most notable types of sovereigns (a key part of its belt) at home?  Below the line, the Court simply asserts (without analysis or support) that the terms `foreign' and `domestic' are two poles on a spectrum. Ante, at 1700, n. 7. It does not grapple, however, with the many decisions of this Court discussed above that contradict that premise—and that do so in the precise context of Indian law (in general) and sovereign immunity (in particular). See supra, at 1706-1709. Nor does it grapple with the reality that, even if the terms were two poles on a spectrum, many Justices of this Court have suggested that Indian Tribes do not fall along that continuum at all and are instead just what they are, Indian Tribes.

That is obviously true but not obviously helpful. Really, the express inclusion of so many other types of sovereigns in the Bankruptcy Code's abrogation provision only deepens the mystery why Tribes are nowhere mentioned. Normally, after all, when Congress includes so many items within `an associated group,' we assume the omission of another means that it has been deliberately `excluded.' Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 80, 122 S.Ct. 2045, 153 L.Ed.2d 82 (2002). Nor, for that matter, has this Court ever held that a statute's general atmospherics can satisfy the clear-statement rule when the text itself comes up short.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,132,"The Court also invokes the Bankruptcy Code's purposes. It contends that Congress designed the Code in part to offer debtors a fresh start, that its provisions were intended to sweep broadly, and that petitioners' view of the statute could upend the policy choices that the Code embodies. Ante, at 1696-1698. In a similar vein, the Court wonders what reason Congress possibly could have had for excluding Tribes from its abrogation provision. Ibid. These are fair questions and concerns. Some of them I share. But they, too, have no place in a case like this one. For purposes of satisfying a clear-statement rule, attempts to construe § 106 in light of the policies underlying the Bankruptcy Code are unavailing. Hoffman, 492 U.S., at 104, 109 S.Ct. 2818 (plurality opinion). Perhaps Members of Congress had good reasons for failing to include Tribes in § 101(27). Perhaps their decision reflected a measured political compromise. Or perhaps the issue of tribal immunity simply never came up. In all events, the result is the same. Absent some clear textual indication, there can be no abrogation.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-056,133,"Setting aside those policy concerns leaves the Court with a methodological one. It fears adopting my approach could transmute our clear-statement rule into some sort of magic-words test. Ante, at 1699. I do not see how it could. Congress could identify Tribes in any number of unmistakable ways—Indians, Native Americans, Indigenous Peoples, or even (as we have seen) domestic dependent nations. Congress has had no trouble using language like that in plenty of other statutory contexts. See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. § 8310, 42 U.S.C. § 8802(17), 49 U.S.C. § 5121(g). Alternatively, Congress could identify Tribes by description—for instance, any other government that operates, in whole or in part, within the territorial bounds of the United States. See 33  F.4th at 622 (Barron, C. J., dissenting). Alternatively still, Congress could abrogate all sovereign immunity through some unequivocal statement to that effect—using, for example, the Court's own formulation, any and every government.

Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b). If the district court denies that motion (or any other Rule 12 motion), the case advances to discovery for the parties to marshal evidence supporting their claims and defenses.

2022-057,37,"The jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 is limited to appeals from  final decisions of the district courts. Interlocutory orders— those that do not dispose of the whole case, like denials of summary judgment— are typically not immediately appealable under § 1291.3 Instead, the general rule is that `a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered, in which claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation may be ventilated.' Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 712, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996), see also 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.

2022-057,38,"Some interlocutory district-court rulings, however, are unreviewable after final judgment because they are overcome by later developments in the litigation. As Ortiz explains, one such ruling is the denial of summary judgment on sufficiency-of-the-evidence grounds. 562 U.S. at 184, 131 S.Ct. 884. Factual challenges depend on, well, the facts, which the parties develop and clarify as the case progresses from summary judgment to a jury verdict. Thus,  once the case proceeds to trial, the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary-judgment motion. Ibid. So after trial, a district court's assessment of the facts based on the summary-judgment record becomes ancient history and is not subject to appeal. Empress Casino Joliet Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 831 F.3d 815, 823-824 (C.A.7 2016). Fact-dependent appeals must be appraised in light of the complete trial record.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,39,"It follows, Ortiz holds, that a party must raise a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim in a post-trial motion to preserve it for appeal. 562 U.S. at 191-192, 131 S.Ct. 884. Appellate review, by its nature, requires a lower court decision to review. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 895, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (the very word `review' presupposes that a litigant's arguments have been raised and considered in the tribunal of first instance). This is especially important for factual challenges based on the trial record, which call for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart. Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 216, 67 S.Ct. 752, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947). The filing of a post-trial motion under Rule 50 allows the district court to take first crack at the question that the appellate court will ultimately face: Was there sufficient evidence in the trial record to support the jury's verdict? Absent such a motion, an appellate court is `powerless' to review the sufficiency of the evidence after trial. Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 189, 131 S.Ct. 884 (quoting Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U.S. 394, 405, 126 S.Ct. 980, 163 L.Ed.2d 974 (2006)).",Barrett,0,
2022-057,41,Younger urges us to extend Ortiz's holding to cover pure questions of law resolved in an order denying summary judgment. We decline the invitation.,Barrett,0,
2022-057,42,"While factual issues addressed in summary-judgment denials are unreviewable on appeal, the same is not true of purely legal issues—that is, issues that can be resolved without reference to any disputed facts. Trials wholly supplant pretrial factual rulings, but they leave pretrial legal rulings undisturbed. The point of a trial, after all, is not to hash out the law. Because a district court's purely legal conclusions at summary judgment are not superseded by later developments in the litigation, Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 184, 131 S.Ct. 884, these rulings follow the general rule and merge into the final judgment, at which point they are reviewable on appeal, Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 712, 116 S.Ct. 1712.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,43,"That difference explains why a summary-judgment motion is sufficient to preserve legal but not factual claims. As Ortiz explains, an appellate court's review of factual challenges after a trial is rooted in the complete trial record, which means that a district court's factual rulings based on the obsolete summary-judgment record are useless. A district court's resolution of a pure question of law, by contrast, is unaffected by future developments in the case. From the reviewing court's perspective, there is no benefit to having a district court reexamine a purely legal issue after trial, because nothing at trial will have given the district court any reason to question its prior analysis. We therefore hold that a post-trial motion under Rule 50 is not required to preserve for appellate review a purely legal issue resolved at summary judgment.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,45,"Younger's counterarguments do not persuade us otherwise. First, he argues that under Ortiz, an order denying summary judgment is not a final decision under § 1291 and cannot be appealed, regardless of whether the motion was decided on legal or factual grounds. We agree that a denial of summary judgment is simply a step along the route to final judgment, and so is typically not immediately appealable. Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 184, 131 S.Ct. 884. But § 1291 does not insulate interlocutory orders from appellate scrutiny, it simply delays review until final judgment. Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S. 424, 430, 105 S.Ct. 2757, 86 L.Ed.2d 340 (1985) (noting that some errors in interlocutory orders go uncorrected until the appeal of a final judgment). Indeed, the Ortiz Court expressly declined to address whether summary-judgment denials on purely legal issues are reviewable. 562 U.S. at 190, 131 S.Ct. 884. That caveat would have made little sense had the Court authoritatively decided that all summary-judgment denials are meaningless passthroughs that appellate courts should ignore.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,46,"Next, Younger complains that Dupree's rule creates a two-track system of summary judgment, in which factual and legal claims follow different routes. Summary judgment is summary judgment, Younger insists, so the claims should all travel the same line. But nothing in Rule 56 demands such uniformity. On the contrary, the Rule provides that summary judgment is appropriate when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a) (emphasis added). Rule 56 thus contemplates that the court will sometimes deny the motion because the facts are genuinely in dispute and other times because the law does not support the movant's position. Fitting the preservation rule to the court's rationale (factual or legal) is therefore consistent with the text.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,47,"It also makes sense. Because a purely legal question is, by definition, one whose answer is independent of disputed facts, factual development at trial will not change the district court's answer. (Granted, the district court might backtrack, but if the question is purely legal, that is because of law books, not trial exhibits.) So what would a repeat-motion requirement for legal questions typically amount to? For litigants, a copy and paste of summary-judgment motions into post-trial format. For district courts, the tedium of saying no twice. There is no reason to force litigants and district courts to undertake that empty exercise.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,48,"Rule 56 aside, Younger insists that Rule 50 supports him. Under this Rule, a district court can grant judgment as a matter of law if it finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b) (emphasis added). Therefore, Younger says, a Rule 50 motion is an appropriate vehicle for raising purely legal issues once a case proceeds to trial. Maybe so, but this argument is beside the point: Even if a party can raise legal issues in a Rule 50 motion, nothing in the Rule requires her to do so.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,49,"Finally, Younger predicts that a separate preservation rule for legal issues will prove unworkable because the line between factual and legal questions can be vexing for courts and litigants. Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 288, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). That's a fair concern, and it would not be surprising if prudent counsel  make sure to renew their arguments in a Rule 50 motion  out of an abundance of caution. Feld v. Feld, 688 F.3d 779, 783 (CADC 2012). But Younger overstates the need for a bright-line rule in this area. Courts of appeals have long found it possible to separate factual from legal matters. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 328, 135 S.Ct. 831, 190 L.Ed.2d 719 (2015). Though there will be edge cases, the experience of the majority of circuits demonstrates that the Courts of Appeals are up to the task. See n. 2, supra. And for all the virtues of bright-line rules, Younger's would come at a steep cost: the loss of appellate review for unwary litigants who think it futile to relitigate an already-rejected legal argument.",Barrett,0,
2022-057,51,The Fourth Circuit was wrong to hold that purely legal issues resolved at summary judgment must be renewed in a post-trial motion. We need not decide whether the issue Dupree raised on appeal is purely legal—the Court of Appeals may evaluate that and any other properly preserved arguments in the first instance. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,Barrett,0,
2022-057,52,It is so ordered.,Barrett,0,
2022-058,32,"Respondent Vitaly Smagin holds a multimillion dollar California judgment against petitioner Ashot Yegiazaryan, who lives in California. Smagin, who resides in Russia, filed suit in the Central District of California alleging that Yegiazaryan, with the assistance of petitioner CMB Monaco (formerly Compagnie Monégasque de Banque), engaged in a pattern of criminal activity, predominantly in and targeted at California, to prevent him from collecting on his California judgment, in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. The District Court dismissed the complaint after concluding that Smagin had failed to allege a domestic injury, as required by RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 579 U.S. 325, 334, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 195 L.Ed.2d 476 (2016). The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Smagin had alleged a domestic injury. This Court agrees with the Ninth Circuit.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,35,"The essential facts as alleged by Smagin are as follows. From 2003 to 2009, Yegiazaryan committed fraud against Smagin, stealing his shares in a joint real estate venture in Moscow. To avoid a Russian criminal indictment for that fraud, Yegiazaryan fled to a mansion in Beverly Hills in 2010, where he has lived ever since. In 2014, Smagin, who lives in Russia, won an arbitration award in London against Yegiazaryan for the misappropriation of his real estate investment (London Award). Yegiazaryan refused to pay that award, which is over $84 million.",Sotomayor,0,

At the time, no funds had yet been paid to Yegiazaryan in satisfaction of that award, but Smagin was concerned that when they were paid, Yegiazaryan would take steps to transfer the money out of Smagin's reach.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,38,"Smagin's concerns were justified. In May 2015, Yegiazaryan received a $198 million settlement in satisfaction of the Kerimov Award. To avoid the District Court's asset freeze, Yegiazaryan accepted the money through the London office of an American law firm headquartered in Los Angeles. Yegiazaryan then created a complex web of offshore entities to conceal the funds, App. 56a, and ultimately transferred the funds to a bank account with petitioner CMB Monaco. Yegiazaryan also directed those in his inner circle to file fraudulent claims against him in foreign jurisdictions, which he would not oppose, in an attempt to obtain sham judgments that would encumber the $198 million, thereby blocking Smagin's access to it.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,39,"Around the same time, Yegiazaryan was hiding his assets in the United States through a system of shell companies owned by family members. Id., at 61a.

S. shell companies until February 2016, when Smagin was granted leave to intervene in Yegiazaryan's California divorce proceedings. The next month, the California District Court in the London Award enforcement action granted Smagin's motion for summary judgment on his petition for confirmation of the Award and entered judgment against Yegiazaryan for $92 million, including interest. The court also issued several postjudgment orders barring Yegiazaryan and those acting at his direction from preventing collection on the judgment.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,41,"For failing to comply with those orders, the District Court subsequently found Yegiazaryan in contempt of court. To avoid having to comply with the contempt order, however, Yegiazaryan falsely claimed he was too ill, and submitted a forged doctor's note to the District Court. When Smagin notified Yegiazaryan that he would be seeking to depose the doctor in question, who resides in California, Yegiazaryan used intimidation, threats, or corrupt persuasion, id., at 82a, to get the doctor to avoid service of the subpoena.",Sotomayor,0,

RICO provides a private right of action to any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of RICO's substantive provisions. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Invoking that cause of action, Smagin sued Yegiazaryan and CMB Bank (the two petitioners here), as well as 10 other defendants, in  the Central District of California.1 The complaint asserts two claims against each: a substantive RICO violation, § 1962(c), and a RICO conspiracy claim, § 1962(d). The thrust of Smagin's allegations is that the defendants worked together under Yegiazaryan's direction to frustrate Smagin's collection on the California judgment through a pattern of wire fraud and other RICO predicate racketeering acts, including witness tampering and obstruction of justice. For these violations, Smagin seeks not only actual damages no less than $130 million, App. 100a, but also attorney's fees and treble damages as authorized under RICO. See § 1964(c).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,44,"The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Smagin had failed to adequately plead a domestic injury, id., at 31a, as required by this Court's decision in RJR Nabisco. See 579 U.S., at 346, 136 S.Ct. 2090 (A private RICO plaintiff therefore must allege and prove a domestic injury to its business or property).

2022-058,45,"The Ninth Circuit reversed. It rejected petitioners' invitation to follow the domestic-injury approach of the Seventh Circuit, which has adopted a rigid, residency-based test for domestic injuries involving intangible property, such as a judgment. 37 F.4th 562, 568, 570 (2022) (citing Armada (Sing.)

Applying that approach, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Smagin had pleaded a domestic injury because he had alleged that his efforts to execute on a California judgment in California against a California resident were foiled by a pattern of racketeering activity that largely occurred in, or was targeted at, California and was designed to subvert enforcement of the judgment in California. 37 F.4th, at 567-568.",Sotomayor,0,

2022-058,50,"To answer that question, the Court employed the presumption against extraterritoriality, which represents a canon of construction, or a presumption about a statute's meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress's power to legislate. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 255, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010).

2022-058,51,"Dual rationales support the presumption against extraterritoriality. On the one hand, it reflects concerns of international comity insofar as it `serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.'

On the other hand, the presumption is informed by the commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind. Smith v. United States, 507 U.S. 197, 204, n. 5, 113 S.Ct. 1178, 122 L.Ed.2d 548 (1993).

2022-058,52,"RJR Nabisco distilled the presumption against extraterritoriality into two steps.

If the answer is yes, then the presumption is rebutted, obviating any need to proceed to step two. If the presumption is not rebutted, however, then step two asks whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute, which is assessed by looking to the statute's `focus.' Ibid.2",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,53,"Applying this framework, the Court assessed the extraterritoriality of two of RICO's substantive provisions and, as relevant here, its private cause of action. As to the substantive provisions, the Court held at step one that they apply extraterritorially to the same extent that RICO's predicates do, making it unnecessary to proceed to step two. Id., at 340, 136 S.Ct. 2090. Regarding RICO's private right of action, § 1964(c), however, the Court's conclusion was different. The Court determined that § 1964(c) does not overcome the presumption at step one because there is no clear indication that Congress intended to create a private right of action for injuries suffered outside of the United States. Id., at 349, 136 S.Ct. 2090. If anything, the Court reasoned, by cabining the private cause of action to injuries to `business or property,' Congress signaled that the civil remedy is not coextensive with § 1962's substantive prohibitions. Id., at 350, 136 S.Ct. 2090. Accordingly, in reference to step two, the Court held that a private RICO plaintiff must allege and prove a domestic injury to its business or property. Id., at 346, 136 S.Ct. 2090.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,54,"In announcing this domestic-injury requirement, the Court did not have occasion to explain what constitutes a domestic-injury, because the plaintiffs in RJR Nabisco  had stipulated that they were not seeking redress for domestic injuries. Id., at 354, 136 S.Ct. 2090. The question now before the Court is whether Smagin has alleged a domestic injury.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,56,"The parties advance competing approaches to the domestic injury inquiry. Petitioners urge the Court to adopt a bright-line rule, akin to the Seventh Circuit's, that locates a plaintiff's injury at the plaintiff's residence. Petitioners advance two different versions of this rule.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,57,"As their primary position, petitioners argue that any injury cognizable under § 1964(c) is necessarily suffered at the plaintiff's residence because the private cause of action remedies only economic injuries, and a plaintiff necessarily suffers that injury at its residence where the economic injury is felt. Brief for Petitioners 2. In the alternative, petitioners argue that, at least when the alleged injury involves intangible property, such as the judgment here, relevant common-law principles locate the intangible property at the plaintiff's place of residence, such that the injury is also located there. Id., at 2-3, 43-44. On either version of petitioners' rule, Smagin cannot allege a domestic injury because he lives in Russia.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,58,"Smagin, in contrast, defends a contextual approach that considers all case-specific facts bearing on where the injury arises, not just where it is felt. Brief for Respondent 9. In the context of this suit, Smagin argues that he has stated a domestic injury because he has alleged that he was injured in his ability to enforce a California judgment, against a California resident, through racketeering acts that were largely designed and carried out in California and were targeted at California. Id., at 3, 21.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,60,"The Court agrees with Smagin and the Ninth Circuit that determining whether a plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury for purposes of RICO is a context-specific inquiry that turns largely on the particular facts alleged in a complaint. 37 F.4th, at 570. Specifically, courts should look to the circumstances surrounding the alleged injury to assess whether it arose in the United States. In this suit, that means looking to the nature of the alleged injury, the racketeering activity that directly caused it,3 and the injurious aims and effects of that activity.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,61,"This approach to the domestic-injury requirement is most consistent with RJR Nabisco. There, the Court clarified that its domestic-injury requirement does not mean that foreign plaintiffs may not sue under RICO. 579 U.S., at 353, n. 12, 136 S.Ct. 2090. Similarly, the Court explained that application of the domestic-injury rule in any given case will not always be self-evident, as disputes may arise as to whether a particular alleged injury is `foreign' or `domestic.' Id., at 354, 136 S.Ct. 2090. These remarks point toward a case-specific inquiry that considers the particular facts surrounding the alleged injury. Petitioners' bright-line rule, in contrast, dispenses with any such subtlety. It makes the location of the plaintiff's residence determinative, thus barring all foreign plaintiffs, exactly as RJR Nabisco said it was not doing.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,62,"A contextual approach to the domestic-injury requirement also better reflects the requirement's origin in step two of the extraterritoriality framework, which assesses whether there is a domestic application of a statute by looking to the statute's focus. RJR Nabisco implied that the focus of § 1964(c) is injuries in business or property by reason of a violation of RICO's substantive provisions. § 1964(c). This focus makes sense because, in the context of RICO, the compensable injury necessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise. Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 497, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). So understood, § 1964(c)'s focus is on the injury, not in isolation, but as the product of racketeering activity. Thus, in assessing whether there is a domestic injury, courts should engage in a case-specific analysis that looks to the circumstances surrounding the injury. If those circumstances sufficiently ground the injury in the United States, such that it is clear the injury arose domestically, then the plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,63,"Because of the contextual nature of the inquiry, no set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for all cases. RICO covers a wide range of predicate acts and is notoriously expansive in scope. Id., at 498-499, 105 S.Ct. 3275. Thus, depending on the allegations, what is relevant in one case to assessing where the injury arose may not be pertinent in another. While a bright-line rule would no doubt be easier to apply, fealty to the statute's focus requires a more nuanced approach.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,65,"This suit illustrates well why the domestic-injury inquiry must account for the facts of the case, rather than rely on a residency-based rule. While it may be true, in some sense, that Smagin has felt his economic injury in Russia, focusing solely on that fact would miss central features of the alleged injury. Zooming out, the circumstances surrounding Smagin's injury make clear it arose in the United States.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,66,"Smagin alleges that he has been injured in his inability to collect his massive judgment. App. 38a. Much of the alleged racketeering activity that caused the injury occurred in the United States. Yegiazaryan took domestic actions to avoid collection, including allegedly creating U. S. shell companies to hide his U.S. assets, submitting a forged doctor's note to a California District Court, and intimidating a U. S.-based witness. It is true that other components of the scheme occurred abroad. As Smagin alleges, however, even those wrongful acts and plans were devised, initiated, and carried out  through acts and communications initiated in and directed towards Los Angeles County, California, with the central purpose of frustrating enforcement of the California judgment. Id., at 45a-46a.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,67,"Further, the injurious effects of the racketeering activity largely manifested in California. Smagin obtained a judgment in California because that is where Yegiazaryan lives, and where Smagin had thus hoped to collect. The rights that the California judgment provides to Smagin exist only in California, including the right to obtain postjudgment discovery, the right to seize assets in California, and the right to seek other appropriate relief from the California District Court. The alleged RICO scheme thwarted those rights, thereby undercutting the orders of the California District Court and Smagin's efforts to collect on Yegiazaryan's assets in California.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,68,"In sum, Smagin's interests in his California judgment against Yegiazaryan, a California resident, were directly injured by racketeering activity either taken in California or directed from California, with the aim and effect of subverting Smagin's rights to execute on that judgment in California. On the Court's contextual approach, those allegations suffice to state a domestic injury in this suit.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,70,"Petitioners argue that a contextual approach is inconsistent with certain common-law principles, which instead favor their bright-line rule. According to petitioners, because Smagin has alleged an economic injury or an injury in intangible property, Brief in Opposition 15-16, courts should look to common-law principles governing the situs of such injuries, when determining whether those injuries are foreign or domestic. Specifically, as to economic injuries, petitioners point to the Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws § 377 (1934), from which they discern the principle that a fraud plaintiff suffers an economic loss at the plaintiff's domicile. Brief for Petitioners 36, see also Sack v. Low, 478 F.2d 360, 366 (CA2 1973) (Under the First Restatement, loss from fraud is deemed to be suffered where its economic impact is felt, normally the plaintiff's residence). As to intangible injuries, petitioners further rely on the principle of mobilia sequuntur personam, which they claim generally locates intangible property at the domicile of its owner. Brief for Petitioners 44. Both principles, they argue, locate Smagin's alleged injury at his residence.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,71,"Petitioners fall short, however, when explaining the relevance of these principles. They do not clearly explain why choice-of-law principles are germane here, let alone why the First Restatement dictates those principles.4 Meanwhile, it is far from clear that petitioners' gloss on the principle of mobilia sequuntur personam was as well established or as wide sweeping as petitioners take it to be, in light of the many twists and turns in the doctrine across a range of contexts. See A. Simowitz, Siting Intangibles, 48 N. Y. U. J. Int'l L. & Pol. 259, 270-292 (2015). In short, at the time of RICO's enactment, both principles were hardly settled  at common law. Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 500, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000).",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,72,"The core problem with petitioners' approach is that it is unmoored from the presumption against extraterritoriality. While legal fictions regarding the situs of economic injuries and intangible property have their justifications in other areas of law, those justifications do not necessarily translate to the presumption against extraterritoriality, with its distinctive concerns for comity and discerning congressional meaning.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,73,"Indeed, it is because petitioners' view invokes these fictions that it generates results so counter to comity and so far afield from any reasonable interpretation of what qualifies as a domestic application of § 1964(c). On petitioners' primary view, a business owner who resides abroad but  owns a brick-and-mortar business in the United States cannot bring a § 1964(c) suit even if an American RICO organization burns down her storefront. Perhaps aware of how odd this seems, petitioners offer a fallback rule for intangible property. That rule fares no better. It provides that if racketeering activity targets the intangible business interests of two U. S. businesses, one owned by a U. S. resident and one owned by someone living abroad, only the former business owner can bring a § 1964(c) suit. There is no evidence Congress intended to impose such a double standard, especially because doing so runs its own risks of generating international discord. These implausible consequences are strong evidence that petitioners have gone astray in assessing the focus of § 1964(c) and, thus, the meaning of domestic injury as contemplated by RJR Nabisco.",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,74,"Finally, petitioners, as well as the dissent, post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.), argue that a contextual approach is unworkable because it does not provide a bright-line rule. Reply Brief 17-18. An approach is not unworkable, however, merely because it directs courts to consider the case-specific circumstances surrounding an injury when assessing where it arises. While the ease with which petitioners' bright-line rule can be applied gives it some surface appeal, Humphrey, 905 F.3d at 709, a look beneath the surface quickly reveals that the test is inconsistent with RJR Nabisco, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and the thrust of § 1964(c) itself. Concerns about a fact-intensive test cannot displace congressional policy choices, where a more nuanced test is true to the statute's meaning.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2022-058,75,"A plaintiff has alleged a domestic injury for purposes of § 1964(c) when the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate it arose in the United States. Smagin alleges that he was injured in California because his ability to enforce a California judgment in California against a California resident was impaired by racketeering activity that largely occurred in or was directed from and targeted at California. Those allegations state a domestic injury. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Sotomayor,0,

2022-058,78,"These are the first cases in which we have been required to decide when injury to intangible property that a civil plaintiff attributes to a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) qualifies as a domestic injury and may therefore provide the basis for recovery under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). See RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 579 U.S. 325, 346-354, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 195 L.Ed.2d 476 (2016). This question has divided the lower courts, but the Court's decision resolves very little. It holds only that ascertaining the site of intangible injuries for purposes of civil RICO requires a court to consult a variety of factors and that two factors it identifies show that respondent has suffered a domestic injury. This analysis offers virtually no guidance to lower courts, and it risks sowing confusion in our extraterritoriality precedents. Rather than take this unhelpful step, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.",Alito,0,
2022-058,80,"We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit split between, on the one hand, the Third and Ninth Circuits, which embrace  a totality-based inquiry like the one the Court adopts here, and, on the other hand, the Seventh Circuit, which has held that RICO injuries to intangible property are sited at the plaintiff's residence. Ante, at 1907, compare Humphrey v. GlaxoSmithKline PLC, 905 F.3d 694, 706-707 (CA3 2018), and 37 F.4th 562, 567-568 (CA9 2022) (case below), with Armada (Sing.) PTE Ltd. v. Amcol Int'l Corp., 885 F.3d 1090, 1094-1095 (CA7 2018).1 The Seventh Circuit's decision, however, contains little analysis and simply declares that it is well understood that a party experiences or sustains injuries to its intangible property at its residence. Id., at 1094, see also Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 471, 137 S.Ct. 973, 197 L.Ed.2d 398 (2017) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (referring to a dearth of reasoned opinions  from the courts of appeals regarding a novel and important question). The Third and Ninth Circuits, for their parts, did not coalesce around any common set of factors to guide the civil RICO domestic-injury inquiry for intangible-property claims. See Humphrey, 905 F.3d, at 706-707, 37 F.4th, at 567-568. And no court of appeals has even broached the possibility that different categorical rules might be available for different types of intangible property (e.g., perhaps there could be a rule that injuries to trademark rights should be sited in the country that provided the trademark). We would greatly benefit from the views of additional courts of appeals on this question. Czyzewski, 580 U.S., at 472, 137 S.Ct. 973 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2022-058,81,"Bringing clarity to this area of the law is not an easy task, and I must conclude that the Court falls short. It cites petitioners' domestic racketeering conduct and the California rights conferred by the California judgment Smagin has obtained to enforce his London arbitral award, but it gives no indication of the relative import of each of these factors. Ante, at 1910-1911. And while the Court appears to envision a long list of factors that might be relevant to this inquiry, see ante, at 1910, it mentions none other than these two. Nor does it say anything about the circumstances that would call for consideration of additional factors, when such factors might outweigh one or both of the ones it mentions, or what these other factors might be.",Alito,0,
2022-058,82,"Of course, under the majority's all-factors-considered approach, many other features of this very suit could be relevant, such as the history and location of the underlying dispute, where any relevant business relationships were formed, Smagin's residence, and the existence of the London arbitral award. Are future courts to infer that these matters have no import? It is difficult to come to any other conclusion given that the Court pays them no heed in undertaking what is ostensibly an examination of all relevant context. Ante, at 1909-1910. But it is equally difficult to see why they are irrelevant (especially in light of the Court's unexplored acknowledgment that in some sense,  Smagin has felt his economic injury in Russia, ante, at 1910), or what room the Court is leaving for additional factors to be identified if none of these counts. And because the Court sets aside the factors that would favor petitioners, it also provides no guidance on how to weigh competing considerations that do not all point toward the same result.",Alito,0,
2022-058,83,"One might additionally think that the nature of the intangible property itself  could be relevant under the majority's approach, such as whether the property is a debt, a stock, a trademark, etc. In these cases, however, the relationship between the California judgment Smagin has obtained and the underlying arbitral award that that judgment confirmed is uncertain, so the precise property at issue is another aspect of this suit that is shrouded in confusion. Smagin acknowledged at oral argument that even though he has obtained multiple judgments confirming the arbitral award, he can collect on only one. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. There is thus at least some relevant relationship between the California judgment and the London arbitral award—the latter of which is not domestic in any way—but the Court does not address this point, either.",Alito,0,
2022-058,84,"Even with respect to the two factors it focuses on, the Court engenders confusion. It offers no hint which of the two might be more important (should they point in different directions), whether either or both are necessary, or whether either is sufficient. And the Court acknowledges that there was also substantial foreign conduct in these cases, but writes that off because it was `initiated in and directed towards' the United States. Ante, at 1910. Once more, I am unsure of the origin or scope of this rule. If domestic conduct is initiated in a foreign nation, does that make it foreign? What exactly does it mean to direct conduct towards the United States? All in all, were I a lower-court judge, I would struggle to apply today's decision to any set of facts other than the precise combination present here. In my view, it is not worth our deciding a case when we provoke so many more questions than we provide answers. That is especially so now that the lower courts must additionally decide whether and how today's cryptic decision binds them, rather than continuing to think through unencumbered when intangible-property injuries are the basis of a domestic application of civil RICO.",Alito,0,
2022-058,86,"It is not just that we are contributing little by deciding these cases, however, we are also risking significant harm, particularly to the uniformity of our case law. A thrust of our international-comity jurisprudence is that we should not lightly give foreign plaintiffs access to U.S. remedial schemes that are far more generous than those available in their home nations. See RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S., at 347-348, 136 S.Ct. 2090, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U.S. 155, 166-167, 124 S.Ct. 2359, 159 L.Ed.2d 226 (2004). In light of RICO's unusually plaintiff-friendly remedies, that concern applies in spades here. See RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S., at 348, 136 S.Ct. 2090. But in today's decision, the Court countenances that the plaintiff's residence may play no role at all in the civil RICO extraterritoriality inquiry. The Court justifies this result with the assertion that favoring U.S. plaintiffs' access to American courts over that of foreign plaintiffs runs its own risks of generating international discord, ante, at 1912, a concern that the Court directly rejected in RJR Nabisco, see 579 U.S., at 361, 136 S.Ct. 2090 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting in relevant part).",Alito,0,
2022-058,87,"Additionally, we have placed a premium on workability in our extraterritorial-application cases. The Court acknowledges that a bright-line rule would be preferable here, but essentially shrugs: RICO is too nuanced for that. Ante, at 1910, 1911-1912. Our cases do not let us off the hook so easily. Compare Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 258-259, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010) (There is no more damning indictment of the Second Circuit's `conduct' and `effects' tests than the Second Circuit's own  declaration that `the presence or absence of any single factor which was considered significant in other cases  is not necessarily dispositive in future cases'), with ante, at 1910 (No set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for all cases).",Alito,0,
2022-058,88,"Perhaps there is a reason why RICO justifies these departures from our customary rules, but I have no confidence in reaching that conclusion now (let alone sub silentio). RJR Nabisco was relatively recent, and there have been only a small number of court of appeals decisions implementing it, and even fewer with respect to intangible property. Moreover, unlike in our typical extraterritoriality case, we have received no input here from the sovereign states our rules will affect, including the U. S. Government.

That sale does not extinguish  the taxpayer's debts. Instead, the borrower remains personally liable. See St. Paul v. St. Anthony Flats Ltd. Partnership, 517 N.W.2d 58, 62 (Minn. App. 1994). Had Tyler received the surplus from the tax sale, she could have at the very least used it to reduce any such liability.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,39,"At this initial stage of the case, Tyler need not definitively prove her injury or disprove the County's defenses. She has plausibly pleaded on the face of her complaint that she suffered financial harm from the County's action, and that is enough for now. See Lujan, 504 U.S., at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.",Roberts,0,

Such taxes are not themselves a taking, but are a mandated contribution from individuals  for the support of the government  for which they receive compensation in the protection which government affords. County of Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U.S. 691, 703, 26 L.Ed. 238 (1881). In collecting these taxes, the State may impose interest and late fees. It may also seize and sell property, including land, to recover the amount owed. See Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220, 234, 126 S.Ct. 1708, 164 L.Ed.2d 415 (2006). Here there was money remaining after Tyler's home was seized and sold by the County to satisfy her past due taxes, along with the costs of collecting them. The question is whether that remaining value is property under the Takings Clause, protected from uncompensated appropriation by the State.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,43,"The Takings Clause does not itself define property. Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 164, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998). For that, the Court draws on existing rules or understandings about property rights. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). State law is one important source.

Otherwise, a State could sidestep the Takings Clause by disavowing traditional property interests in assets it wishes to appropriate. Phillips, 524 U.S., at 167, 118 S.Ct. 1925, see also Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358 (1980), Hall v.

So we also look to traditional property law principles, plus historical practice and this Court's precedents. Phillips, 524 U.S., at 165-168, 118 S.Ct. 1925, see, e.g., United States v.

Radford, 295 U.S. 555, 590, 55 S.Ct. 854, 79 L.Ed. 1593 (1935) (mortgage on farm). Historically, Minnesota also recognized that a homeowner whose property has been sold to satisfy delinquent property taxes had an interest in the excess value of her home  above the debt owed. See Farnham v. Jones, 32 Minn. 7, 11, 19 N.W. 83, 85 (1884). But in 1935, the State purported to extinguish that property interest by enacting a law providing that an owner forfeits her interest in her home when she falls behind on her property taxes. See 1935 Minn. Laws pp. 713-714, § 8. This means, the County reasons, that Tyler has no property interest protected by the Takings Clause.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,45,"History and precedent say otherwise. The County had the power to sell Tyler's home to recover the unpaid property taxes. But it could not use the toehold of the tax debt to confiscate more property than was due. By doing so, it effected a classic taking in which the government directly appropriates private property for its own use. Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v.

2022-059,47,"The principle that a government may not take more from a taxpayer than she owes can trace its origins at least as far back as Runnymeade in 1215, where King John swore in the Magna Carta that when his sheriff or bailiff came to collect any debts owed him from a dead man, they could remove property until the debt which is evident shall be fully paid to us, and the residue shall be left to the executors to fulfil the will of the deceased.

Stat. at Large 488-489 (1692). As Blackstone explained, the common law demanded the same: If a tax collector seized a taxpayer's property, he was bound by an implied contract in law to restore the property on payment of the debt, duty, and expenses, before the time of sale, or, when sold, to render back the overplus. 2 Commentaries on the Laws of England 453 (1771).",Roberts,0,

Ten States adopted similar statutes shortly after the founding.1 For example, Maryland required that only so much land be sold as may be sufficient to discharge the taxes thereon due, and provided that if the sale produced more than needed for the taxes, such overplus of money shall be paid to the owner. 1797 Md. Laws ch. 90, §§ 4-5. This Court enforced one such state statute against a Georgia tax collector, reasoning that if a whole tract of land was sold when a small part of it would have been sufficient for the taxes, which at present appears to be the case, the collector unquestionably exceeded his authority.

Acts p. 153, § 4. But about a decade later, Virginia enacted a new scheme, which provided for the forfeiture of any delinquent land to the Commonwealth. Virginia passed this harsh forfeiture regime in response to the loose, cheap and unguarded system of disposing of her public lands that the Commonwealth had adopted immediately following statehood. McClure v. Maitland, 24 W.Va. 561, 564 (1884). To encourage settlement, Virginia permitted any person to acquire title to so much  unappropriated lands as he or she shall desire to purchase at the price of 40 pounds per 100 acres. 1779 Va. Acts p. 95, § 2. Within two decades, nearly all of Virginia's land had been claimed, much of it by nonresidents who did not live on or farm the land but instead hoped to sell it for a profit. McClure, 24 W.Va., at 564. Many of these nonresidents wholly neglected to pay the taxes on the land, id., at 565, so Virginia provided that title to any taxpayer's land was completely lost, forfeited and vested in the Commonwealth if the taxpayer failed to pay taxes within a set period, 1790 Va. Acts p. 5, § 5. This solution was short lived, however, the Commonwealth repealed the forfeiture scheme in 1814 and once again sold so much only of each tract of land  as will be sufficient to discharge the debt. 1813 Va. Acts p. 21, § 27. Virginia's exceptional and temporary forfeiture scheme carries little weight against the overwhelming consensus of its sister States. See Martin v.

2022-059,55,"Our precedents have also recognized the principle that a taxpayer is entitled to the surplus in excess of the debt owed. In United States v. Taylor, 104 U.S. 216, 26 L.Ed. 721 (1881), an Arkansas taxpayer whose property had been sold to satisfy a tax debt sought to recover the surplus from the sale. A nationwide tax had been imposed by Congress in 1861 to raise funds for the Civil War. Under that statute, if a taxpayer did not pay, his property would be sold and the surplus of the proceeds of the sale would be paid to the owner. Act of Aug. 5, 1861, § 36, 12 Stat. 304. The next year, Congress added a 50 percent penalty in the rebelling States, but made no mention of the owner's right to surplus after a tax sale. See Act of June 7, 1862, § 1, 12 Stat. 422. Taylor's property had been sold for failure to pay taxes under the 1862 Act, but he sought to recover the surplus under the 1861 Act. Though the 1862 Act made no mention of the right of the owner of the lands to receive the surplus proceeds of their sale, we held that the taxpayer was entitled to the surplus because nothing in the 1862 Act took from the owner the right accorded him by the act of 1861, of applying for and receiving from the treasury the surplus proceeds of the sale of his lands. Taylor, 104 U.S., at 218-219.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,56,"We extended a taxpayer's right to surplus even further in United States v. Lawton, 110 U.S. 146, 3 S.Ct. 545, 28 L.Ed. 100 (1884). The property owner had an unpaid tax bill under the 1862 Act for $170.50. Id., at 148, 3 S.Ct. 545. The Federal Government seized the taxpayer's property and, instead of selling it to a private buyer, kept the property for itself at a value of $1100. Ibid. The property owner sought to recover the excess value from the Government, but the Government refused. Ibid. The 1861 Act explicitly provided that any surplus from tax sales to private parties had to be returned to the owner, but it did not mention paying the property owner the excess value where the Government kept the property for its own use instead of selling it. See 12 Stat. 304. We held that the taxpayer was still entitled to the surplus under the statute, just as if the Government had sold the property. Lawton, 110 U.S., at 149-150, 3 S.Ct. 545. Though the 1861 statute did not explicitly provide the right to the surplus under such circumstances, to withhold the surplus from the owner would be to violate the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and to deprive him of his property without due process of law, or to take his property for public use without just compensation. Id., at 150, 3 S.Ct. 545.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,57,"The County argues that Taylor and Lawton were superseded by Nelson v. City of New York, 352 U.S. 103, 77 S.Ct. 195, 1 L.Ed.2d 171 (1956), but that case is readily distinguished. There New York City foreclosed on properties for unpaid water bills. Under the governing ordinance, a property owner had almost two months after the city filed for foreclosure to pay off the tax debt, and an additional 20 days to ask for the surplus from any tax sale. Id., at 104-105, n. 1, 77 S.Ct. 195. No property owner requested his surplus within the required time. The owners later sued the city, claiming that it had denied them due process and equal protection of the laws. Id., at 109, 77 S.Ct. 195. In their reply brief before this Court, the owners also argued for the first time that they had been denied just compensation under the Takings Clause. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,58,"We rejected this belated argument. Lawton had suggested that withholding the surplus from a property owner always violated the Fifth Amendment, but there was no specific procedure there for recovering the surplus. Nelson, 352 U.S., at 110, 77 S.Ct. 195. New York City's ordinance, in comparison, permitted the owner to recover the surplus but required that the owner have filed a timely answer in the foreclosure proceeding, asserting his property had a value substantially exceeding the tax due. Ibid. (citing New York v. Chapman Docks Co., 1 App.Div.2d 895, 149 N.Y.S.2d 679 (1956)). Had the owners challenging the ordinance done so, a separate sale could have taken place so that they might receive the surplus. 352 U.S., at 110, 77 S.Ct. 195. The owners did not take advantage of this procedure, so they forfeited their right to the surplus. Because the New York City ordinance did not absolutely preclude an owner from obtaining the surplus proceeds of a judicial sale, but instead simply defined the process through which the owner could claim the surplus, we found no Takings Clause violation. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,59,"Unlike in Nelson, Minnesota's scheme provides no opportunity for the taxpayer to recover the excess value, once absolute title has transferred to the State, any excess value always remains with the State. The County argues that the delinquent taxpayer could sell her house to pay her tax debt before the County itself seizes and sells the house. But requiring a taxpayer to sell her house to avoid a taking is not the same as providing her an opportunity to recover the excess value of her house once the State has sold it.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,61,"Finally, Minnesota law itself recognizes that in other contexts a property owner is entitled to the surplus in excess of her debt. Under state law, a private creditor may enforce a judgment against a debtor by selling her real property, but no more shall be sold than is sufficient to satisfy the debt, and the creditor may receive only so much of the proceeds as will satisfy the debt. Minn. Stat. §§ 550.20, 550.08 (2022).

So too if a taxpayer does not pay taxes on her personal property, like a car. § 277.21, subd. 13. Until 1935, Minnesota followed the same rule for the sale of real property.

Stat. § 282.08.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,66,"The County portrays this as just another example in the long tradition of States taking title to abandoned property. We upheld one such statutory scheme in Texaco. There, Indiana law dictated that a mineral interest automatically reverted to the owner of the land if not used for 20 years. 454 U.S., at 518, 102 S.Ct. 781. Use included excavating minerals, renting out the right to excavate, paying taxes, or simply filing a statement of claim with the local recorder of deeds. Id., at 519, 102 S.Ct. 781. Owners who lost their mineral interests challenged the statute as unconstitutional. We held that the statute did not violate the Takings Clause because the State has the power to condition the permanent retention of a property right on the performance of reasonable conditions that indicate a present intention to retain the interest. Id., at 526, 102 S.Ct. 781 (emphasis added). Indiana reasonably treated a mineral interest that had not been used for 20 years and for which no statement of claim had been filed as abandoned. Id., at 530, 102 S.Ct. 781. There was thus no taking, for after abandonment, the former owner retained no interest for which he may claim compensation. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2022-059,67,"The County suggests that here, too, Tyler constructively abandoned her property by failing to comply with a reasonable condition imposed by the State. But the County cites no case suggesting that failing to pay property taxes is itself sufficient for abandonment. Cf. Krueger v. Market, 124 Minn. 393, 397, 145 N.W. 30, 32 (1914) (owner did not abandon property despite failing to pay taxes for 30 years). Abandonment requires the surrender or relinquishment or disclaimer of all rights in the property. Rowe v. Minneapolis, 49 Minn. 148, 157, 51 N.W. 907, 908 (1892). It is the owner's failure to make any use of the property—and for a lengthy period of time—that causes the lapse of the property right. Texaco, 454 U.S., at 530, 102 S.Ct. 781 (emphasis added). In Texaco, the owners lost their property because they made no use of their interest for 20 years and then failed to take the simple step of filing paperwork indicating that they still claimed ownership over the interest. In comparison, Minnesota's forfeiture scheme is not about abandonment at all. It gives no weight to the taxpayer's use of the property. Indeed, the delinquent taxpayer can continue to live in her house for years after falling behind in taxes, up until the government sells it. See § 281.70. Minnesota cares only about the taxpayer's failure to contribute her share to the public fisc. The County cannot frame that failure as abandonment to avoid the demands of the Takings Clause.* * *",Roberts,0,

Ante, at 1380-1381. But even a cursory review of the District Court's excessive-fines analysis—which the Eighth Circuit adopted as well-reasoned, 26 F.4th 789, 794 (2022)—reveals that it too contains mistakes future lower courts should not be quick to emulate.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-059,73,"First, the District Court concluded that the Minnesota tax-forfeiture scheme is not punitive because its primary purpose is remedial—aimed, in other words, at compensating the government for lost revenues due to the non-payment of taxes. 505 F.Supp.3d 879, 896 (Minn. 2020). That primary-purpose test finds no support in our law. Because sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose, this Court has said that the Excessive Fines Clause applies to any statutory scheme that serves in part to punish. Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 610, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993) (emphasis added). It matters not whether the scheme has a remedial purpose, even a predominantly remedial purpose. So long as the law cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, the Excessive Fines Clause applies. Ibid. (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted). Nor, this Court has held, is it appropriate to label sanctions as remedial when (as here) they bear `no correlation to any damages sustained by society or to the cost of enforcing the law,' and any relationship between the Government's actual costs and the amount of the sanction is merely coincidental. Id., at 621-622, and n. 14, 113 S.Ct. 2801.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-059,74,"Second, the District Court asserted that the Minnesota tax-forfeiture scheme cannot be punitive because it actually confers a windfall on the delinquent taxpayer when the value of the property that is forfeited is less than the amount of taxes owed. 505 F.Supp.3d, at 896. That observation may be factually true, but it is legally irrelevant. Some prisoners better themselves behind bars, some addicts credit court-ordered rehabilitation with saving their lives. But punishment remains punishment all the same. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 61. Of course, no one thinks that an individual who profits from an economic penalty has a winning excessive-fines claim. But nor has this Court ever held that a scheme producing fines that punishes some individuals can escape constitutional scrutiny merely because it does not punish others.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-059,75,"Third, the District Court appears to have inferred that the Minnesota scheme is not punitive because it does not turn on the culpability of the individual property owner. 505 F.Supp.3d, at 897. But while a focus on culpability can sometimes make a provision look more like punishment, this Court has never endorsed the converse view. Austin, 509 U.S., at 619, 113 S.Ct. 2801. Even without emphasizing culpability, this Court has  said a statutory scheme may still be punitive where it serves another goal of punishment, such as deterrence. United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 329, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). And the District Court expressly approved the Minnesota tax-forfeiture scheme in this case in large part because `the ultimate possibility of loss of property serves as a deterrent to those taxpayers considering tax delinquency.' 505 F.Supp.3d, at 899 (emphasis added). Economic penalties imposed to deter willful noncompliance with the law are fines by any other name. And the Constitution has something to say about them: They cannot be excessive.",Gorsuch,0,

2022-062,36,"As this Court's precedents amply demonstrate, Article III standing is not merely a troublesome hurdle to be overcome if possible so as to reach the `merits' of a lawsuit which a party desires to have adjudicated, it is a part of the basic charter promulgated by the Framers of the Constitution at Philadelphia in 1787. Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 476, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). The principle of Article III standing is built on a single basic idea—the idea of separation of powers. Allen, 468 U.S. at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315. Standing doctrine helps safeguard the Judiciary's proper—and properly limited— role in our constitutional system. By ensuring that a plaintiff has standing to sue, federal courts prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.

The States want the Federal Judiciary to order the Department to alter its arrest  policy so that the Department arrests morenoncitizens.1",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,39,The threshold question is whether the States have standing under Article III to maintain this suit. The answer is no.,Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,40,"To establish standing, a plaintiff must show an injury in fact caused by the defendant and redressable by a court order. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. The District Court found that the States would incur additional costs because the Federal Government is not arresting more noncitizens. Monetary costs are of course an injury. But this Court has also stressed that the alleged injury must be legally and judicially cognizable. Raines, 521 U.S. at 819, 117 S.Ct. 2312. That requires, among other things, that the dispute is traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process—in other words, that the asserted injury is traditionally redressable in federal court. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), accord Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. 752. In adhering to that core principle, the Court has examined history and tradition, among other things, as a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article III empowers federal courts to consider. Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 274, 128 S.Ct. 2531, 171 L.Ed.2d 424 (2008), see TransUnion LLC, 594 U. S., at ___ _ ___, 141 S.Ct. at 2203-04.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,41,"The States have not cited any precedent, history, or tradition of courts ordering the Executive Branch to change its arrest or prosecution policies so that the Executive Branch makes more arrests or initiates more prosecutions. On the contrary, this Court has previously ruled that a plaintiff lacks standing to bring such a suit.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,42,"The leading precedent is Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). The plaintiff in that case contested a State's policy of declining to prosecute certain child-support violations. This Court decided that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the State's policy, reasoning that in American jurisprudence at least, a party lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution of another. Id., at 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146. The Court concluded that a citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,43,"The Court's Article III holding in Linda R. S. applies to challenges to the Executive Branch's exercise of enforcement discretion over whether to arrest or prosecute. See id., at 617, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 760-761, 767, n. 13, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005), cf. Sure-Tan, Inc. v.

S. principle in immigration context and stating that the petitioners there had no judicially cognizable interest in procuring enforcement of the immigration laws by the Executive Branch). And importantly, that Article III standing principle remains the law today, the States have pointed to no case or historical practice holding otherwise. A telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with the States' assertion of standing to bring this lawsuit is the lack of historical precedent supporting it. Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561  U.S. 477, 505, 130 S.Ct. 3138, 177 L.Ed.2d 706 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Raines, 521 U.S. at 826, 117 S.Ct. 2312 (Not only do appellees lack support from precedent, but historical practice appears to cut against them as well).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,44,"In short, this Court's precedents and longstanding historical practice establish that the States' suit here is not the kind redressable by a federal court.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,46,"Several good reasons explain why, as Linda R. S. held, federal courts have not traditionally entertained lawsuits of this kind.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,47,"To begin with, when the Executive Branch elects not to arrest or prosecute, it does not exercise coercive power over an individual's liberty or property, and thus does not infringe upon interests that courts often are called upon to protect. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-562, 112 S.Ct. 2130. And for standing purposes, the absence of coercive power over the plaintiff makes a difference: When a plaintiff's asserted injury arises from the government's allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else, much more is needed to establish standing. Id., at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (emphasis deleted).2",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,48,"Moreover, lawsuits alleging that the Executive Branch has made an insufficient number of arrests or brought an insufficient number of prosecutions run up against the Executive's Article II authority to enforce federal law. Article II of the Constitution assigns the executive Power to the President and provides that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. U. S. Const., Art. II, § 1, cl. 1, § 3. Under Article II, the Executive Branch possesses authority to decide how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the law. TransUnion LLC, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 2207, see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 576-578, 112 S.Ct. 2130, Allen, 468 U.S. at 760-761, 104 S.Ct. 3315. The Executive Branch—not the Judiciary —makes arrests and prosecutes offenses on behalf of the United States. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974) (the Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case), Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 922-923, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997) (Brady Act provisions held unconstitutional because, among other things, they transferred power to execute federal law to state officials), United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996) (decisions about enforcement of the Nation's criminal laws lie within the special province of the Executive (internal quotation marks omitted)), Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (A lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a breach of the law, and it is to the President, and not to the Congress, that the Constitution entrusts the responsibility to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed' (quoting U. S. Const., Art. II, § 3)), see also United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167, 171 (CA5 1965).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,49,"That principle of enforcement discretion over arrests and prosecutions extends to the immigration context, where the Court has stressed that the Executive's enforcement discretion implicates  not only normal domestic law enforcement priorities but also foreign-policy objectives. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 490-491, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999). In line with those principles, this Court has declared that the Executive Branch also retains discretion over whether to remove a noncitizen from the United States. Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012) (Federal officials, as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,50,"In addition to the Article II problems raised by judicial review of the Executive Branch's arrest and prosecution policies, courts generally lack meaningful standards for assessing the propriety of enforcement choices in this area. After all, the Executive Branch must prioritize its enforcement efforts. See Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-608, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985). That is because the Executive Branch (i) invariably lacks the resources to arrest and prosecute every violator of every law and (ii) must constantly react and adjust to the ever-shifting public-safety and public-welfare needs of the American people.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,51,"This case illustrates the point. As the District Court found, the Executive Branch does not possess the resources necessary to arrest or remove all of the noncitizens covered by § 1226(c) and § 1231(a)(2). That reality is not an anomaly —it is a constant. For the last 27 years since § 1226(c) and § 1231(a)(2) were enacted in their current form, all five Presidential administrations have determined that resource constraints necessitated prioritization in making immigration arrests.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,52,"In light of inevitable resource constraints and regularly changing public-safety and public-welfare needs, the Executive Branch must balance many factors when devising arrest and prosecution policies. That complicated balancing process in turn leaves courts without meaningful standards for assessing those policies. Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830-832, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985), Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 190-192, 113 S.Ct. 2024, 124 L.Ed.2d 101 (1993). Therefore, in both Article III cases and Administrative Procedure Act cases, this Court has consistently recognized that federal courts are generally not the proper forum for resolving claims that the Executive Branch should make more arrests or bring more prosecutions. See Linda R. S., 410 U.S. at 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, cf. Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831, 105 S.Ct. 1649 (recognizing the general unsuitability for judicial review of agency decisions to refuse enforcement), ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 283, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987) (it is entirely clear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject of judicial review).3",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,53,"All of those considerations help explain why federal courts have not traditionally  entertained lawsuits of this kind. By concluding that Texas and Louisiana lack standing here, we abide by and reinforce the proper role of the Federal Judiciary under Article III. The States' novel standing argument, if accepted, would entail expansive judicial direction of the Department's arrest policies. If the Court green-lighted this suit, we could anticipate complaints in future years about alleged Executive Branch under-enforcement of any similarly worded laws—whether they be drug laws, gun laws, obstruction of justice laws, or the like. We decline to start the Federal Judiciary down that uncharted path. Our constitutional system of separation of powers contemplates a more restricted role for Article III courts. Raines, 521 U.S. at 828, 117 S.Ct. 2312.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,55,"In holding that Texas and Louisiana lack standing, we do not suggest that federal courts may never entertain cases involving the Executive Branch's alleged failure to make more arrests or bring more prosecutions.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,56,"First, the Court has adjudicated selective-prosecution claims under the Equal Protection Clause. In those cases, however, a party typically seeks to prevent his or her own prosecution, not to mandate additional prosecutions against other possible defendants. See, e.g., Wayte, 470 U.S. at 604, 105 S.Ct. 1524, Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 459, 463, 116 S.Ct. 1480.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,57,"Second, as the Solicitor General points out, the standing analysis might differ when Congress elevates de facto injuries to the status of legally cognizable injuries redressable by a federal court. See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 3, cf. TransUnion LLC, 594 U. S., at ___ _ ___, 141 S.Ct. at 2204-05, Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 20, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998), Raines, 521 U.S. at 820, n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2312, Lujan, 504 U.S. at 578, 112 S.Ct. 2130, Linda R. S., 410 U.S. at 617, n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 1146. For example, Congress might (i) specifically authorize suits against the Executive Branch by a defined set of plaintiffs who have suffered concrete harms from executive under-enforcement and (ii) specifically authorize the Judiciary to enter appropriate orders requiring additional arrests or prosecutions by the Executive Branch.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,58,"Here, however, the relevant statutes do not supply such specific authorization. The statutes, even under the States' own reading, simply say that the Department shall arrest certain noncitizens. Given the deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, a purported statutory arrest mandate, without more, does not entitle any particular plaintiff to enforce that mandate in federal court. Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 761, 764-765, 767, n. 13, 125 S.Ct. 2796, cf. Heckler, 470 U.S. at 835, 105 S.Ct. 1649. For an arrest mandate to be enforceable in federal court, we would need at least a stronger indication from Congress that judicial review of enforcement discretion is appropriate—for example, specific authorization for particular plaintiffs to sue and for federal courts to order more arrests or prosecutions by the Executive. Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 761, 125 S.Ct. 2796. We do not take a position on whether such a statute would suffice for Article III purposes, our only point is that no such statute is present in this case.4",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,59,"Third, the standing calculus might change if the Executive Branch wholly abandoned its statutory responsibilities to make arrests or bring prosecutions. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a plaintiff  arguably could obtain review of agency non-enforcement if an agency has consciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities. Heckler, 470 U.S. at 833, n. 4, 105 S.Ct. 1649 (internal quotation marks omitted), see id., at 839, 105 S.Ct. 1649 (Brennan, J., concurring), cf. 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). So too, an extreme case of non-enforcement arguably could exceed the bounds of enforcement discretion and support Article III standing. But the States have not advanced a Heckler-style abdication argument in this case or argued that the Executive has entirely ceased enforcing the relevant statutes. Therefore, we do not analyze the standing ramifications of such a hypothetical scenario.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,60,"Fourth, a challenge to an Executive Branch policy that involves both the Executive Branch's arrest or prosecution priorities and the Executive Branch's provision of legal benefits or legal status could lead to a different standing analysis. That is because the challenged policy might implicate more than simply the Executive's traditional enforcement discretion. Cf. Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U. S. ___, ___ _ ___, 140 S.Ct. 1891, 1906-07, 207 L.Ed.2d 353 (2020) (benefits such as work authorization and Medicare eligibility accompanied by non-enforcement meant that the policy was more than simply a non-enforcement policy), Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 154 (CA5 2015) (Linda R. S. concerned only nonprosecution, which is distinct from both nonprosecution and the conferral of benefits), aff'd by an equally divided Court, 579 U.S. 547, 136 S.Ct. 2271, 195 L.Ed.2d 638 (2016). Again, we need not resolve the Article III consequences of such a policy.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,61,"Fifth, policies governing the continued detention of noncitizens who have already been arrested arguably might raise a different standing question than arrest or prosecution policies. Cf. Biden v. Texas, 597 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2528, 213 L.Ed.2d 956 (2022). But this case does not concern a detention policy, so we do not address the issue here.5",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,63,"The discrete standing question raised by this case rarely arises because federal statutes that purport to require the Executive Branch to make arrests or bring prosecutions are rare—not surprisingly, given the Executive's Article II authority to enforce federal law and the deeply rooted history of enforcement discretion in American law. Indeed, the States cite no similarly worded federal laws. This case therefore involves both a highly unusual provision of federal law and a highly unusual lawsuit.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,64,"To be clear, our Article III decision today should in no way be read to suggest or imply that the Executive possesses some freestanding or general constitutional authority to disregard statutes requiring or prohibiting executive action. Moreover, the Federal Judiciary of course routinely  and appropriately decides justiciable cases involving statutory requirements or prohibitions on the Executive. See, e.g., American Hospital Assn. v. Becerra, 596 U. S. ___, ___ _ ___, 142 S.Ct. 1896, 1903-06, 213 L.Ed.2d 251 (2022), Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.

Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 592-595, 613-615, 635, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), id., at 636-646, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (Kennedy, J., concurring), Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637-638, 640, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,65,"This case is categorically different, however, because it implicates only one discrete aspect of the executive power— namely, the Executive Branch's traditional discretion over whether to take enforcement actions against violators of federal law. And this case raises only the narrow Article III standing question of whether the Federal Judiciary may in effect order the Executive Branch to take enforcement actions against violators of federal law— here, by making more arrests. Under this Court's Article III precedents and the historical practice, the answer is no.6",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,66,"It bears emphasis that the question of whether the federal courts have jurisdiction under Article III is distinct from the question of whether the Executive Branch is complying with the relevant statutes— here, § 1226(c) and § 1231(a)(2). In other words, the question of reviewability is different from the question of legality. We take no position on whether the Executive Branch here is complying with its legal obligations under § 1226(c) and § 1231(a)(2). We hold only that the federal courts are not the proper forum to resolve this dispute.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,67,"On that point, even though the federal courts lack Article III jurisdiction over this suit, other forums remain open for examining the Executive Branch's arrest policies. For example, Congress possesses an array of tools to analyze and influence those policies—oversight, appropriations, the legislative process, and Senate confirmations, to name a few. Cf. Raines, 521 U.S. at 829, 117 S.Ct. 2312, Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193, 113 S.Ct. 2024. And through elections, American voters can both influence Executive Branch policies and hold elected officials to account for enforcement decisions. In any event, those are political checks for the political process. We do not opine on whether any such actions are appropriate in this instance.",Kavanaugh,0,
2022-062,68,"The Court's standing decision today is narrow and simply maintains the long-standing jurisprudential status quo. See Linda R. S., 410 U.S. at 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146. The Court's decision does not alter the balance of powers between Congress and the Executive, or change the Federal Judiciary's traditional role in separation of powers cases.* * *  In sum, the States have brought an extraordinarily unusual lawsuit. They want a federal court to order the Executive Branch to alter its arrest policies so as to make more arrests. Federal courts have not traditionally entertained that kind of lawsuit, indeed, the States cite no precedent for a lawsuit like this. The States lack Article III standing because this Court's precedents and the historical experience preclude the States' attempt to litigate this dispute at this time and in this form. Raines, 521 U.S. at 829, 117 S.Ct. 2312. And because the States lack Article III standing, the District Court did not have jurisdiction. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.",Kavanaugh,0,

2022-062,73,"Article III vests federal courts with the power to decide Cases and Controversies. Standing doctrine honors the limitations inherent in this assignment by ensuring judges attend to actual harms rather than abstract grievances. If individuals and groups could invoke the authority of a federal court to forbid what they dislike for no more reason than they dislike it, we would risk exceeding the judiciary's limited constitutional mandate and infringing on powers committed to other branches of government.

2022-062,74,"To establish standing to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury, one that is both traceable to the defendant and redressable by a court order. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). If a plaintiff fails at any step, the court cannot reach the merits of the dispute. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 102-104, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). This is true whether the plaintiff is a private person or a State. After all, standing doctrine derives from Article III, and nothing in that provision suggests a State may have standing when a similarly situated private party does not. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 536-538, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,75,"The Court holds that Texas and Louisiana lack standing to challenge the Guidelines because a party lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution  of another. Ante, at 1970 (internal quotation marks omitted). To be sure, the district court found that the Guidelines have led to an increase in the number of aliens with criminal convictions and final orders of removal who are released into the States. 606 F.Supp.3d 437, 459-463, 467 (SD Tex. 2022). The district court also found that, thanks to this development, the States have spent, and continue to spend, more money on law enforcement, incarceration, and social services. Id., at 463-465, 467. Still, the Court insists, several good reasons explain why these harms are insufficient to afford the States standing to challenge the Guidelines. Ante, at 1971.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,76,"I confess to having questions about each of the reasons the Court offers. Start with  its observation that the States have not pointed to any historical practice of courts ordering the Executive Branch to change its arrest or prosecution policies. Ante, at 1970-1971, 1971. The Court is right, of course, that history and tradition offer a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article III empowers federal courts to consider. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2204, 210 L.Ed.2d 568 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). But, again, the district court found that the Guidelines impose significant costs on the States. 606 F.Supp.3d at 495. The Court today does not set aside this finding as clearly erroneous. Nor does anyone dispute that even one dollar's worth of harm is traditionally enough to qualify as concrete injury under Article III. TransUnion, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 2204, see also Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 792, 801-02, 209 L.Ed.2d 94 (2021). Indeed, this Court has allowed other States to challenge other Executive Branch policies that indirectly caused them monetary harms. See, e.g., Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ _ ___, 139 S.Ct. 2551, 2565-66, 204 L.Ed.2d 978 (2019). So why are these States now forbidden from doing the same?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,77,"Next, the Court contends that, when the Executive Branch elects not to arrest or prosecute, it does not exercise coercive power over an individual's liberty or property. Ante, at 1971. Here again, in principle, I agree. But if an exercise of coercive power matters so much to the Article III standing inquiry, how to explain decisions like Massachusetts v. EPA? There the Court held that Massachusetts had standing to challenge the federal government's decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. See 549 U.S. at 516-526, 127 S.Ct. 1438. And what could be less coercive than a decision not to regulate? In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court chose to overlook this difficulty in part because it thought the State's claim of standing deserved special solicitude. Id., at 520, 127 S.Ct. 1438. I have doubts about that move. Before Massachusetts v. EPA, the notion that States enjoy relaxed standing rules had no basis in our jurisprudence. Id., at 536, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting). Nor has special solicitude played a meaningful role in this Court's decisions in the years since. Even so, it's hard not to wonder why the Court says nothing about special solicitude in this case. And it's hard not to think, too, that lower courts should just leave that idea on the shelf in future ones.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,78,"Finally, the Court points to the fact that Article II vests in the President considerable enforcement discretion. Ante, at 1971-1972. So much so that courts generally lack meaningful standards for assessing the propriety of the Executive Branch's enforcement choices. Ante, at 1972. But almost as soon as the Court announces this general rule, it adds a caveat, stressing that this case concerns only arrest and prosecution policies. Ante, at 1974 n. 5. It's a curious qualification. Article II does not have an Arrest and Prosecution Clause. It endows the President with the executive Power, § 1, cl. 1, and charges him with taking Care that federal laws are faithfully executed, § 3. These provisions give the President a measure of discretion over the enforcement of all federal laws, not just those that can lead to arrest and prosecution. So if the Court means what it says about Article II, can it mean what it says about the narrowness of its holding? There's another curious qualification in the Court's opinion too. The standing calculus might change, we are told, if the Executive Branch wholly abandoned its statutory responsibilities to make arrests or bring prosecutions. Ante, at  1973. But the Court declines to say more than that because the States have not advanced such an argument. Ibid. Is that true, though? The States have pleaded a claim under the Take Care Clause. App. 106. Is that not an abdication argument? Did they fail to plead it properly? Or is the Court simply ignoring it?",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,80,"As I see it, the jurisdictional problem the States face in this case isn't the lack of a judicially cognizable interest or injury. Ante, at 1970-1971 (internal quotation marks omitted). The States proved that the Guidelines increase the number of aliens with criminal convictions and final orders of removal released into the States. They also proved that, as a result, they spend more money on everything from law enforcement to healthcare. The problem the States face concerns something else altogether—a lack of redressability.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,81,"To establish redressability, a plaintiff must show from the outset of its suit that its injuries are capable of being remedied `by a favorable decision.' Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, see also id., at 570 112 S.Ct. 2130 (plurality opinion). Ordinarily, to remedy harms like those the States demonstrated in this suit, they would seek an injunction. The injunction would direct federal officials to detain aliens consistent with what the States say the immigration laws demand. But even assuming an injunction like that would redress the States' injuries, that form of relief is not available to them.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,82,"It is not available because of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). There, Congress provided that no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain immigration laws, including the very laws the States seek to have enforced in this case. If there were any doubt about how to construe this command, we resolved it in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2057, 213 L.Ed.2d 102 (2022). In that case, we held that § 1252(f)(1) prohibits lower courts from ordering federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions. Id., at ___, 142 S.Ct. at 2065. Put simply, the remedy that would ordinarily have the best chance of redressing the States' harms is a forbidden one in this case.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,83,"The district court thought it could sidestep § 1252(f)(1). Instead of issuing an injunction, it purported to vacate the Guidelines pursuant to § 706(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). 606 F.Supp.3d at 498-501, and n. 71. Vacatur, as the district court understood it, is a distinct form of relief that operates directly on agency action, depriving it of legal force or effect. See id., at 499-500. And vacatur, the district court reasoned, does not offend § 1252(f)(1), because it does not entail an order directing any federal official to do anything. See id., at 501, n. 71. The States embrace this line of argument before us. Brief for Respondents 43-47, Tr. of Oral Arg. 75-82.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,84,"It's a clever workaround, but it doesn't succeed. Start with perhaps the simplest reason. Assume for the moment the district court was right that § 1252(f)(1) does not bar vacatur orders and that § 706(2) authorizes courts to issue them. Even so, a vacatur order still does nothing to redress the States' injuries. The Guidelines merely advise federal officials about how to exercise their prosecutorial discretion when it comes to deciding which aliens to prioritize for arrest and removal. A judicial decree rendering the Guidelines a nullity does nothing to change the fact that federal officials possess the same underlying prosecutorial discretion. Nor does such a decree  require federal officials to change how they exercise that discretion in the Guidelines' absence. It's a point even the States have acknowledged. Tr. of Oral Arg. 82-83, see also id., at 75-77, 125.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,85,"Faced with that difficulty, the States offer this reply. As a practical matter, they say, we can expect federal officials to alter their arrest and prosecution priorities in light of a judicial opinion reasoning that the Guidelines are unlawful. See id., at 80, 82-83. But this doesn't work either. Whatever a court may say in an opinion does no more to compel federal officials to change how they exercise their prosecutorial discretion than an order vacating the Guidelines. Nor do we measure redressability by asking whether a court's legal reasoning may inspire or shame others into acting differently. We measure redressability by asking whether a court's judgment will remedy the plaintiff's harms. As this Court recently put it: It is a federal court's judgment, not its opinion, that remedies an injury, thus it is the judgment, not the opinion, that demonstrates redressability. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. ___, ___, 143 S.Ct. 1609, 1640, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2023). If the rule were otherwise, and courts could simply assume that everyone  will honor the legal rationales that underlie their decrees, then redressability would always exist. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 825, 112 S.Ct. 2767, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,86,"Perhaps sensing they have run into yet another roadblock, the States try one last way around it. Fleetingly, they direct us to the parenthetical in § 1252(f)(1): (other than the Supreme Court). That language, they say, allows this Court to invoke the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, to fashion its own injunction. And the possibility that this Court might award them relief, the States suggest, makes their injuries redressable after all. See Brief for Respondents 47, cf. post, at 1995 (ALITO, J., dissenting).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,87,"It's an argument that yields more questions than answers. The parenthetical the States cite is a curious provision, one that does not appear to have an analogue elsewhere in the United States Code. Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2528, 2561, 213 L.Ed.2d 956 (2022) (BARRETT, J., dissenting). Even assuming it permits this Court to award an injunction when a case comes to us on review, it does not obviously solve the States' redressability problem. Normally, after all, a plaintiff must establish redressability from the outset of the suit. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, see also id., at 570 112 S.Ct. 2130 (plurality opinion). Not only that, a plaintiff must show a favorable decision is `likely' to provide effectual relief. Id., at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. When the States filed this suit, however, the possibility that it might find its way to this Court was speculative at best. See id., at 570 112 S.Ct. 2130 (plurality opinion) (rejecting an argument that redressability could depend on the fortuity that a case has made its way to this Court).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,88,"Nor is that the only complication. Ordinarily, to win an injunction from any court, a party must satisfy several factors. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U.S. 388, 391, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006). The States relegate any mention of these factors to a short, formulaic paragraph tacked onto the end of their brief. See Brief for Respondents 48. Worse, the only injunction they seek is one barring implementation and enforcement of the Guidelines—essentially an injunction imitating a vacatur order. Id., at 47. And as we have seen, an order like that would  leave officials with their prosecutorial discretion intact. See supra, at 1978-1979. So, even if this Court were to take the unusual step of issuing and superintending its own injunction, giving the States the very order they seek is hardly sure to redress the injuries they assert.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,90,"Beyond these redressability problems may lie still another. Recall the essential premise on which the district court proceeded —that the APA empowers courts to vacate agency action. The federal government vigorously disputes this premise, arguing that the law does not contemplate this form of relief. The reasons the government offers are plenty and serious enough to warrant careful consideration.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,92,"Traditionally, when a federal court finds a remedy merited, it provides party-specific relief, directing the defendant to take or not take some action relative to the plaintiff. If the court's remedial order affects nonparties, it does so only incidentally. See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 931, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975) (Neither declaratory nor injunctive relief can directly interfere with the enforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal plaintiffs.), Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.) (A court of equity  cannot lawfully enjoin the world at large.), see also Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 2392, 2425, 201 L.Ed.2d 775 (2018) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (). This tracks the founding-era understanding that courts render a judgment or decree upon the rights of the litigants. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 718, 37 U.S. 657, 9 L.Ed. 1233 (1838). It also ensures that federal courts respect the limits of their Article III authority to decide cases and controversies and avoid trenching on the power of the elected branches to shape legal rights and duties more broadly. After all, the judicial Power is the power to decide cases for parties, not questions for everyone. S. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 421 (2017).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,93,"Despite these foundational principles, in recent years a number of lower courts have asserted the authority to issue decrees that purport to define the rights and duties of sometimes millions of people who are not parties before them. Three years ago, I reflected on the rise of the universal injunction and raised questions about its consistency with the separation of powers and our precedents. Department of Homeland Security v. New York, 589 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 599, 600-01, 206 L.Ed.2d 115 (2020) (opinion concurring in grant of stay). I observed, too, that the routine issuance of universal injunctions has proven unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these sometimes conflicting decrees. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,94,"Matters have not improved with time. Universal injunctions continue to intrude on powers reserved for the elected branches. They continue to deprive other lower courts of the chance to weigh in on important questions before this Court has to decide them. They continue to encourage parties to engage in forum shopping and circumvent rules governing class-wide relief. Recent events have highlighted another problem too. Sometimes, the government may effectively submit to a universal decree running against it in order to avoid the usual and important requirement, under the APA, that a regulation originally promulgated using notice and comment may only be repealed through notice  and comment. Arizona v. City and County of San Francisco, 596 U.S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1926, 1927, 213 L.Ed.2d 284 (2022) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). It is a strategy that amounts to little more than `rulemaking-by-collective-acquiescence.' Ibid., see also Danco Laboratories, LLC v.

2022-062,95,"Today's case presents a variation on the theme. The district court ordered wholesale vacatur of the Guidelines, rendering them inoperable with respect to any person anywhere. 606 F.Supp.3d at 499, 502. As authority for its course, the district court cited § 706(2) of the APA. That provision does not say anything about vacating agency action (wholesale or otherwise). Instead, it authorizes a reviewing court to set aside agency action. Still, from those two words alone, the district court thought the power to nullify the Guidelines with respect to anyone anywhere surely follows. See 606 F.Supp.3d at 498-500.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,96,"Color me skeptical. If the Congress that unanimously passed the APA in 1946 meant to overthrow the bedrock practice of case-by-case judgments with respect to the parties in each case and vest courts with a new and far-reaching remedial power, it surely chose an obscure way to do it. Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 396 (CA6 2022) (Sutton, C. J., concurring). At the very least, it is worth a closer look.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,98,"Begin with the words set aside in isolation. If they might suggest to some a power to vacate agency action in the sense of rendering it null and void, just as naturally they might mean something else altogether. They might simply describe what a court usually does when it finds a federal or state statute unconstitutional, or a state law preempted by a federal one. Routinely, a court will disregard offensive provisions like these and proceed to decide the parties' dispute without respect to them. In Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137 (1951), for example, Justice Frankfurter observed that we are to set aside the judgment of those whose duty it is to legislate only if the Constitution requires it. Id., at 525, 71 S.Ct. 857 (concurring opinion). Justice Frankfurter hardly meant to suggest the Court had the power to erase statutes from the books. See id., at 525-526, 71 S.Ct. 857. Instead, he used the phrase to mean that a court should disregard—refuse to apply—an unconstitutional law. It is a usage that was common at the time of the APA's adoption and that remains so today. See Webster's New International Dictionary 2291 (2d ed. 1954) (defining set aside as to put to one side, discard, dismiss and to reject from consideration, overrule), Webster's New World College Dictionary 1329 (5th ed. 2016) (defining set aside as to set apart and to discard, dismiss, reject).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,99,"There are many reasons to think § 706(2) uses set aside to mean disregard rather than vacate. For one thing, at the time of the APA's adoption, conventional wisdom regarded agency rules as quasi-legislative in nature. See Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 624, 628, 55 S.Ct. 869, 79 L.Ed. 1611 (1935), see also D. Currie & F. Goodman, Judicial Review of Federal Administrative Action: Quest for the Optimum Forum, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 40 (1975). And federal courts have never enjoyed the power to vacate legislation. Instead, they  possess little more than the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment. Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). Reading set aside to mean disregard ensures parallel judicial treatment of statutes and rules.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,100,"For another thing, the term set aside appears in § 706 of the APA. That section is titled Scope of review, a title it has borne since the law's enactment in 1946. 60 Stat. 243. And ordinarily, when we think about the scope of a court's review, we do not think about the remedies the court may authorize after reaching its judgment on the merits. Instead, we think about the court's decisional process leading up to that judgment. Understanding set aside as a command to disregard an unlawful rule in the decisional process fits perfectly within this design. Understanding the phrase as authorizing a remedy does not.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,101,"What follows in § 706 appears to confirm the point. The statute begins by providing that, to the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning and applicability of the terms of an agency action. Exactly as expected, we find an instruction about the decisional process—one requiring the court to apply de novo review on questions of law as it considers the parties' arguments in the course of reaching its judgment. Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2400, 2416, 204 L.Ed.2d 841 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nothing here speaks to remedies.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,102,"The remaining statutory language is more of the same. Section 706 goes on to instruct that the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be, among other things, arbitrary, capricious, contrary to constitutional right, in excess of statutory authority, or unsupported by substantial evidence. § 706(2). Looking at the provision as a whole, rather than focusing on two words in isolation, we see further evidence that it governs a court's scope of review or decisional process. The statute tells judges to resolve the cases that come to them without regard to deficient agency action, findings, or conclusions—an instruction entirely consistent with the usual negative power of courts to disregard that which is unlawful. Mellon, 262 U.S. at 488, 43 S.Ct. 597.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,103,"Other details are telling too. Consider the latter part of § 706(2)'s directive to set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions. The APA defines agency action to include the whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act. 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). A court can disregard any of those things. But what would it even mean to say a court must render null and void an agency's failure to act? Notice, too, the language about findings. Often, judges disregard factual findings unsupported by record evidence and resolve the case at hand without respect to them. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6) (Findings of fact  must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.). None of that means we may pretend to rewrite history and scrub any trace of faulty findings from the record.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,104,"Consider as well the larger statutory context. Section 702 restricts judicial review to persons who have suffered legal wrong because of agency action, or been adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action. The provision also instructs that any mandatory or injunctive decree shall specify the Federal officer or officers  personally responsible for  compliance. Here, it seems, Congress nodded to traditional standing rules and remedial principles. Yet under the district court's reading, we must suppose Congress proceeded just a few paragraphs later to plow right through those rules and empower a single judge to award a novel form of relief affecting parties and nonparties alike.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,105,"Then there is § 703. That is where the APA most clearly discusses remedies. Section 703 authorizes aggrieved persons to bring any applicable form of legal action, including actions for declaratory judgments or writs of prohibitory or mandatory injunction or habeas corpus. Conspicuously missing from the list is vacatur. And what exactly would a form of legal action seeking vacatur look like anyway? Would it be a creature called a writ of vacatur? Nobody knows (or bothers to tell us). Nor is it apparent why Congress would have listed most remedies in § 703 only to bury another (and arguably the most powerful one) in a later section addressed to the scope of review. Cf. J. Harrison, Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act Does Not Call for Universal Injunctions or Other Universal Remedies, 37 Yale J. Reg. Bull. 37, 37, 45-46 (2020).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,106,"The district court's reading of set aside invites still other anomalies. Section 706(2) governs all proceedings under the APA. Any interpretation of set aside therefore must make sense in the context of an enforcement proceeding, an action for a declaratory judgment, a suit for an injunction, or habeas. See § 703. This poses a problem for the district court's interpretation, for no one thinks a court adjudicating a declaratory action or a habeas petition vacates agency action along the way. See Brief for United States 41-42, Harrison, 37 Yale J. Reg. Bull., at 46. The anomaly dissipates, however, if we read § 706(2) as instructing courts about when they must disregard agency action in the process of deciding a case.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,107,"Imagine what else it would mean if § 706(2) really did authorize vacatur. Ordinary joinder and class-action procedures would become essentially irrelevant in administrative litigation. Why bother jumping through those hoops when a single plaintiff can secure a remedy that rules the world? See Bray, 131 Harv. L. Rev., at 464-465. Surely, too, it is odd that leading scholars who wrote extensively about the APA after its adoption apparently never noticed this supposed remedy. See J. Harrison, Vacatur of Rules Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 40 Yale J. Reg. Bull. 119, 127-128 (2023) (discussing scholarship of Professors Kenneth Culp Davis and Louis Jaffe), see also Department of Justice, Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947) (offering the Executive Branch's view that § 706 simply restates the present law as to the scope of judicial review). These are not people who would have missed such a major development in their field.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,109,"As always, there are arguments on the other side of the ledger, and the States tee up several. They first reply that § 706(2) must allow vacatur of agency action because the APA models judicial review of agency action on appellate review of judgments, and appellate courts sometimes vacate judgments. Brief for Respondents 40. But just because Congress may sometimes refer to collateral judicial review of executive action as `an appeal'  does not make it an `appeal' akin to that taken from the district court to the court of appeals. Garland v. Ming Dai, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1669, 1678, 210 L.Ed.2d 11 (2021). Nor does any of that tell us in which respects the APA models judicial review of agency action on appellate review  of lower court judgments. According to one scholar, the salient similarities between appellate review and judicial review of agency action concern the standards of review—in both types of proceedings, a reviewing court engages in a more rigorous review of legal questions and a more deferential review of factual findings. T. Merrill, Article III, Agency Adjudication, and the Origins of the Appellate Review Model of Administrative Law, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 939, 940-941 (2011). None of that has to do with remedies, once again, it concerns a court's scope of review or decisional process.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,110,"The States next invoke § 706(1) and § 705. The former provides that courts shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. The latter says courts may issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings. The States insist that it would be illogical for the APA to authorize these remedies but not vacatur. Brief for Respondents 40. Is it so clear, though, that § 706(1) and § 705 authorize remedies? Section 706(1) does seem to contemplate a remedy. But it's one § 703 mentions—mandatory injunctions. So § 706(1) might not authorize a remedy as much as confirm the availability of a traditional remedy to address agency inaction. The same could be said about § 705, it might just confirm courts' authority to issue traditional equitable relief pending judicial review. Cf. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 69, n. 15, 94 S.Ct. 937, 39 L.Ed.2d 166 (1974) (explaining that § 705 was primarily intended to reflect existing law).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,111,"The States also direct us to scholarship that in turn purports to identify a few instances of federal courts setting aside agency action in the years leading up to the APA. See Brief for Respondents 41, see also Brief for State of Florida as Amicus Curiae 17. It is not obvious, however, that these few cases stand for so much. In two of them, this Court upheld the agency action in question and thus had no occasion to opine on appropriate relief. See Houston v. St. Louis Independent Packing Co., 249 U.S. 479, 486-487, 39 S.Ct. 332, 63 L.Ed. 717 (1919), The Assigned Car Cases, 274 U.S. 564, 584, 47 S.Ct. 727, 71 L.Ed. 1204 (1927). In a third case, the plaintiff sought to enjoin enforcement of an order of the Federal Communications Commission. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 408, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 86 L.Ed. 1563 (1942). That is a claim for traditional equitable relief, and indeed, the Court held that the complaint stated a cause of action in equity and remanded for further proceedings. Id., at 425, 62 S.Ct. 1194. A fourth case, involving an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, seems of a piece. There, a district court held the Commission's order invalid and restrained  enforcement of it. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, 5 F.Supp. 929, 936 (ND Ohio 1933). This Court affirmed. See United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 293 U.S. 454, 55 S.Ct. 268, 79 L.Ed. 587 (1935). True, this Court described the case as an appeal from a decree  setting aside the Commission's order. Id., at 455, 55 S.Ct. 268. But the fact that the lower court had only restrained enforcement of the order goes to show that set aside did not then (and does not now) necessarily translate to vacate.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,112,"At the end of the day, the States fall back on other lower court decisions. For more than 30 years, they say, vacatur has been the ordinary result when the D. C. Circuit determines that agency regulations are unlawful. Brief for Respondents 42 (internal quotation marks omitted). Doubtless, to the extent those decisions are carefully reasoned, they merit respectful consideration. But, equally, they do not  bind us. Cf. post, at 1996, n. 7 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (observing that this Court has only ever assumed that the APA authorizes vacatur).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,113,"In raising questions about the district court's claim that § 706(2) authorizes vacatur of agency action, I do not pretend that the matter is open and shut. Thoughtful arguments and scholarship exist on both sides of the debate. Nor do I mean to equate vacatur of agency action with universal injunctions. Despite some similarities, courts can at least arguably trace their authority to order vacatur to language in a statute and practice in some lower courts. But the questions here are serious ones. And given the volume of litigation under the APA, this Court will have to address them sooner or later. Until then, we would greatly benefit from the considered views of our lower court colleagues.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,115,"Suppose my doubts about vacatur are unfounded. Suppose the APA really does authorize both traditional forms of equitable relief (in § 703) and a more expansive equitable power to vacate agency action (in § 706). Even if that were true, a district court should think twice—and perhaps twice again—before granting such sweeping relief. Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th at 396 (Sutton, C. J., concurring).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,116,"After all, this Court has long instructed that equitable relief must be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact. Gill v. Whitford, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1916, 1930, 201 L.Ed.2d 313 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). Any remedy a judge authorizes must not be more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to redress the complaining parties. Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979). And faithful application of those principles suggests that an extraordinary remedy like vacatur would demand truly extraordinary circumstances to justify it. Cf. S. Bray & P. Miller, Getting Into Equity, 97 N. D. L. Rev. 1763, 1797 (2022) (In equity it all connects—the broader and deeper the remedy the plaintiff wants, the stronger the plaintiff's story needs to be.).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,117,"The temptations a single district judge may face when invited to vacate agency rules are obvious. Often, plaintiffs argue that everyone deserves to benefit from their effort to litigate the case and the court's effort to decide it. Judges may think efficiency and uniformity favor the broadest possible relief. But there are serious countervailing considerations. As with universal injunctions, vacatur can stymie the orderly review of important questions, lead to forum shopping, render meaningless rules about joinder and class actions, and facilitate efforts to evade the APA's normal rulemaking processes. Vacatur can also sweep up nonparties who may not wish to receive the benefit of the court's decision. Exactly that happened here. Dozens of States, counties, and cities tell us they did not seek and do not want the benefit of the district court's vacatur order in this case. See Brief for New York et al. as Amici Curiae 1-2, Brief for 21 Cities, Counties, and Local Government Organizations as Amici Curiae 2-3.",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,118,"More importantly still, universal relief, whether by way of injunction or vacatur, strains our separation of powers. It exaggerates the role of the Judiciary in our constitutional order, allowing individual judges to act more like a legislature by decreeing the rights and duties of people nationwide. This Court has warned that few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to undermine public confidence in the neutrality and integrity of the Judiciary than one which casts courts in the role of a Council of Revision, conferring on  themselves the power to invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees with them. Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 145-146, 131 S.Ct. 1436, 179 L.Ed.2d 523 (2011). At a minimum, then, district courts must carefully consider all these things before doling out universal relief. And courts of appeals must do their part, too, asking whether party-specific relief can adequately protect the plaintiff's interests. If so, an appellate court should not hesitate to hold that broader relief is an abuse of discretion. Cf. Kentucky v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556-557 (CA6 2023) (Larsen, J.).*",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,119,"In our system of government, federal courts play an important but limited role by resolving cases and controversies. Standing doctrine honors this limitation at the front end of every lawsuit. It preserves a forum for plaintiffs seeking relief for concrete and personal harms while filtering out those with generalized grievances that belong to a legislature to address. Traditional remedial rules do similar work at the back end of a case. They ensure successful plaintiffs obtain meaningful relief. But they also restrain courts from altering rights and obligations more broadly in ways that would interfere with the power reserved to the people's elected representatives. In this case, standing and remedies intersect. The States lack standing because federal courts do not have authority to redress their injuries. Section 1252(f)(1) denies the States any coercive relief. A vacatur order under § 706(2) supplies them no effectual relief. And such an order itself may not even be legally permissible. The States urge us to look past these problems, but I do not see how we might. The Constitution affords federal courts considerable power, but it does not establish government by lawsuit. R. Jackson, The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 286-287 (1941).",Gorsuch,0,
2022-062,120,"Justice BARRETT, with whom Justice GORSUCH joins, concurring in the judgment.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,121,"I agree with the Court that the States lack standing to challenge the Federal Government's Guidelines for the enforcement of immigration law. But I reach that conclusion for a different reason: The States failed to show that the District Court could order effective relief. Justice GORSUCH ably explains why that is so. Ante, p. 1976 (opinion concurring in judgment). And because redressability is an essential element of Article III standing, the District Court did not have jurisdiction.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,122,"The Court charts a different path. In its view, this case can be resolved based on what it calls the fundamental Article III principle that `a citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.' Ante, at 1968 (quoting Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973)). In other words, the Court says, the States have not asserted a `judicially cognizable interest' in this case. Ante, at 1970-1971. Respectfully, I would not take this route.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,124,"To begin with, I am skeptical that Linda R. S. suffices to resolve this dispute. First, the Court reads that decision too broadly. Consider the facts. The mother of an illegitimate child sued in federal court, apparently seeking an injunction running against the district attorney forbidding him from declining prosecution of the child's father for failure to pay child support. 410 U.S. at 614-616, 93 S.Ct. 1146. She objected, on equal protection  grounds, to the State's view that fathers of illegitimate children were not within the ambit of the relevant child-neglect statute. Id., at 616, 93 S.Ct. 1146.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,125,"We agreed that the plaintiff suffered an injury stemming from the failure of her child's father to contribute support payments. Id., at 618, 93 S.Ct. 1146. But if the plaintiff were granted the requested relief, it would result only in the jailing of the child's father. Ibid. Needless to say, the prospect that prosecution would lead to child-support payments could, at best, be termed only speculative. Ibid. For this reason, we held that the plaintiff lacked standing. Only then, after resolving the standing question on redressability grounds, did we add that a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another. Id., at 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146. In short, we denied standing in Linda R. S. because it was speculative that the plaintiff's requested relief would redress her asserted injury, not because she failed to allege one. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 79, n. 24, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978).",Barrett,0,
2022-062,126,"Viewed properly, Linda R. S. simply represents a specific application of the general principle that when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily `substantially more difficult' to establish given the causation and redressability issues that may arise. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). That is true for the States here. I see little reason to seize on the case's bonus discussion of whether a private citizen has a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another to establish a broad rule of Article III standing. Linda R. S., 410 U.S. at 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,127,"Second, even granting the broad principle the Court takes from Linda R. S., I doubt that it applies with full force in this case. Unlike the plaintiff in Linda R. S., the States do not seek the prosecution of any particular individual—or even any particular class of individuals. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 624, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989) (Federal standing `often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted'). In fact, they disclaim any interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of noncitizens. See Brief for Respondents 15, Tr. of Oral Arg. 124-125. They acknowledge that 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(1)'s detention obligation only applies until the Government makes a decision whether or not to prosecute. Tr. of Oral Arg. 100. And they readily concede that if the Government decides not to prosecute, any detention obligation imposed by § 1226(c)(1) immediately ends. Ibid. The States make similar concessions with respect to § 1231(a)(2). They maintain, for example, that § 1231(a)(2) applies only where the United States has used its prosecutorial discretion to bring a notice to appear, to prosecute that all the way to a final  order of removal. Id., at 130. But if the Government for any reason chooses to discontinue proceedings, the alleged detention obligation does not attach. Id., at 131.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,128,"The upshot is that the States do not dispute that the Government can prosecute whomever it wants. They seek, instead, the temporary detention of certain noncitizens during elective removal proceedings of uncertain duration. And the States' desire to remove the Guidelines' influence on the Government's admittedly broad discretion to enforce immigration law meaningfully differs from the Linda R. S. plaintiff's desire to channel prosecutorial discretion toward a particular target. Given all of this, I would not treat Linda R. S. as the  leading precedent for resolving this case. Ante, at 1970-1971. In my view, the Court is striking new ground rather than applying settled principles.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,130,"In addition to its reliance on Linda R. S., the Court offers several reasons why federal courts have not traditionally entertained lawsuits of this kind. Ante, at 1971. I am skeptical that these reasons are rooted in Article III standing doctrine.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,131,"Take, for example, the Court's discussion of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005). Ante, at 1973. There, we reasoned that given the deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indication from the legislature than, for example, the bare use of the word `shall' in a statutory directive. Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 761, 125 S.Ct. 2796. The Court today concludes that no such statute is present in this case. Ante, at 1973. But Castle Rock is not a case about Article III standing. It addressed whether an individual who has obtained a state-law restraining order has a constitutionally protected property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment in having the police enforce the restraining order when they have probable cause to believe it has been violated. 545 U.S. at 750-751, 125 S.Ct. 2796. I see no reason to opine on Castle Rock's application here, especially given that the parties (correctly) treat Castle Rock as relevant to the merits of their statutory claims rather than to the States' standing to bring them. See Brief for Petitioners 8, Brief for Respondents 30.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,132,"The Court also invokes the Executive's Article II authority to enforce federal law. Ante, at 1971. I question whether the President's duty to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, Art. II, § 3, is relevant to the standing analysis. While it is possible that Article II imposes justiciability limits on federal courts, it is not clear to me why any such limit should be expressed through Article III's definition of a cognizable injury. Moreover, the Court works the same magic on the Take Care Clause that it does on Castle Rock: It takes an issue that entered the case on the merits and transforms it into one about standing. See ante, at 1977-1978 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.)",Barrett,0,
2022-062,133,"The Court leans, too, on principles set forth in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). Ante, at 1972, 1973-1974. But, again, Heckler was not about standing. It addressed a different question: the extent to which a decision of an administrative agency to exercise its `discretion' not to undertake certain enforcement actions is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. 470 U.S. at 823, 105 S.Ct. 1649, see also 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) (the APA's judicial-review provisions do not apply to the extent that agency action is committed to agency discretion by law). Heckler held that an agency's decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from judicial review under the APA. 470 U.S. at 832, 105 S.Ct. 1649. But such a decision is only presumptively unreviewable, the presumption may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers. Id., at 832-833, 105 S.Ct. 1649. Whatever Heckler's relevance to cases like this one, it does not establish a principle of Article III standing. And elevating it to the status of a constitutional rule would transform it from a case about statutory provisions (that Congress is free to amend) to one about a constitutional principle (that lies beyond Congress's domain). Although the  Court notes that Heckler involved the APA, its conflation of Heckler with standing doctrine is likely to cause confusion. See ante, at 1972 (analogizing Article III cases to Administrative Procedure Act cases).* * *",Barrett,0,
2022-062,134,"The Court weaves together multiple doctrinal strands to create a rule that is not only novel, but also in tension with other decisions. See ante, at 1976-1978 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). In my view, this case should be resolved on the familiar ground that it must be `likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,' that any injury will be `redressed by a favorable decision.' Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. I respectfully concur only in the judgment.",Barrett,0,
2022-062,135,"Justice ALITO, dissenting.",Alito,0,
2022-062,136,"The Court holds Texas lacks standing to challenge a federal policy that inflicts substantial harm on the State and its residents by releasing illegal aliens with criminal convictions for serious crimes. In order to reach this conclusion, the Court brushes aside a major precedent that directly controls the standing question, refuses to apply our established test for standing, disregards factual findings made by the District Court after a trial, and holds that the only limit on the power of a President to disobey a law like the important provision at issue is Congress's power to employ the weapons of inter-branch warfare—withholding funds, impeachment and removal, etc. I would not blaze this unfortunate trail. I would simply apply settled law, which leads ineluctably to the conclusion that Texas has standing.",Alito,0,
2022-062,137,"This Court has long applied a three-part test to determine whether a plaintiff has standing to sue. Under that test, a plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove that it has been subjected to or imminently faces an injury that is: (1) concrete and particularized, (2) fairly traceable to the challenged action, and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Under that familiar test, Texas clearly has standing to bring this suit.1",Alito,0,
2022-062,138,"Nevertheless, the United States (the defendant in this case) has urged us to put this framework aside and adopt a striking new rule. At argument, the Solicitor General was asked whether it is the position of the United States that the Constitution does not allow any party to challenge a President's decision not to enforce laws he does not like. What would happen, the Solicitor General was asked, if a President chose not to enforce the environmental laws or the labor laws? Would the Constitution bar an injured party from bringing suit? She responded:",Alito,0,
2022-062,139,"That's correct under this Court's precedent, but the framers intended political checks in that circumstance. You know, if—if an administration did something that extreme and said we're just not going to enforce the law at all, then the President would be held to account by the voters, and Congress has tools at its disposal as well. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-062,140,"Thus, according to the United States, even if a party clearly meets our three-part test for Article III standing, the Constitution  bars that party from challenging a President's decision not to enforce the law. Congress may wield what the Solicitor General described as political  tools— which presumably means such things as withholding funds, refusing to confirm Presidential nominees, and impeachment and removal—but otherwise Congress and the American people must simply wait until the President's term in office expires.",Alito,0,
2022-062,141,"The Court—at least for now—does not fully embrace this radical theory and instead holds only that, with some small and equivocal limitations that I will discuss, no party may challenge the Executive's arrest and prosecution policies. Ante, at 1974, n. 5. But the Court provides no principled explanation for drawing the line at this point, and that raises the concern that the Court's only reason for framing its rule as it does is that no more is needed to dispose of this case. In future cases, Presidential power may be extended even further. That disturbing possibility is bolstered by the Court's refusal to reject the Government's broader argument.",Alito,0,
2022-062,142,"As I will explain, nothing in our precedents even remotely supports this grossly inflated conception of executive Power, U. S. Const., Art. II, § 1, which seriously infringes the legislative Powers that the Constitution grants to Congress, Art. I, § 1. At issue here is Congress's authority to control immigration, and this Court has repeatedly emphasized that `over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over' the admission of aliens. Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977). In the exercise of that power, Congress passed and President Clinton signed a law that commands the detention and removal of aliens who have been convicted of certain particularly dangerous crimes. The Secretary of Homeland Security, however, has instructed his agents to disobey this legislative command and instead follow a different policy that is more to his liking. And the Court now says that no party injured by this policy is allowed to challenge it in court.",Alito,0,
2022-062,143,"That holding not only violates the Constitution's allocation of authority among the three branches of the Federal Government, it also undermines federalism. This Court has held that the Federal Government's authority in the field of immigration severely restricts the ability of States to enact laws or follow practices that address harms resulting from illegal immigration. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 401, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012). If States are also barred from bringing suit even when they satisfy our established test for Article III standing, they are powerless to defend their vital interests. If a President fails or refuses to enforce the immigration laws, the States must simply bear the consequences. That interpretation of executive authority and Article III's case or controversy requirement is deeply and dangerously flawed.",Alito,0,
2022-062,145,"The Court's opinion omits much that is necessary to understand the significance of its decision, and I therefore begin by summarizing the relevant statutory provisions, the challenged Department of Homeland Security (DHS) action, and the District Court's findings of fact regarding the injury faced by the State of Texas as the result of what DHS has done.",Alito,0,
2022-062,147,"The relevant statutory provisions have figured in several prior decisions, and in those cases we have recounted how they came to be enacted and have clearly described what they require. These provisions were part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility  Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), which was adopted against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 518, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003).2 Congress concluded that a central cause of that failure was the Attorney General's broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings. Id., at 519, 123 S.Ct. 1708. To remedy this problem, Congress subtracted some of that discretion when it comes to the arrest and release of criminal aliens. Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 954, 966, 203 L.Ed.2d 333 (2019) (emphasis in original).",Alito,0,
2022-062,148,"Two such limits are important here. First, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) directs the Government to take into custody any alien inadmissible or deportable on certain criminal or terrorist grounds when the alien is released from criminal custody, including when such an alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation. Second, § 1231(a) imposes a categorical detention mandate. Section 1231(a)(2) provides that the Government shall detain an alien during the removal period, which often begins either when an order of removal becomes administratively final or when an alien is released from detention or confinement not arising from immigration process, § 1231(a)(1)(B). This requirement is reinforced by the direction that under no circumstance during the removal period shall the Government release an alien found inadmissible or deportable under almost any of the grounds relevant under § 1226(c). § 1231(a)(2). And § 1231(a)(1)(A) commands that the Government shall remove the alien within the removal period.",Alito,0,

2022-062,150,"Actions taken by Congress when IIRIRA was enacted underscore this conclusion. Because the provisions described above left the Executive with no discretion to refrain from arresting and detaining covered aliens, even during the time immediately after IIRIRA's enactment when the Executive was still expanding its capacities to enforce the new law, Congress passed transition rules that delayed the onset of the Secretary's obligation to begin making arrests as soon as covered aliens were released from criminal custody. Nielsen, 586 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct. at 969. If the Executive had possessed the discretion to decline to enforce the new mandates in light of resource constraints, see ante, at 1972, those transition rules would have been entirely superfluous.

Certainly it is not supported by the cases it cites. They either underscore the general rule that the Executive possesses enforcement discretion, see Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 490-491, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142  L.Ed.2d 940 (1999), or pair that general rule with the observation that the States cannot limit the Government's discretion in pursuing removal, see Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396, 409, 132 S.Ct. 2492. Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with Congress's power to displace executive discretion, and the fact that five Presidential administrations sometimes neglected the mandates is likewise irrelevant. See ante, at 1972. As I have stressed before, the Executive cannot acquire authority forbidden by law through a process akin to adverse possession, Biden v. Texas, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct. at 2557 (dissenting opinion), and that is true even if the adverse possession is bipartisan.",Alito,0,
2022-062,153,"The events that gave rise to this case began on January 20, 2021, when the Acting Secretary of DHS issued a memorandum with enforcement priorities for the detention and removal of aliens found to be in this country illegally. This memorandum prioritized: (1) aliens whose apprehension implicated national security, (2) aliens not present before November 1, 2020, and (3) aliens due to be released from criminal confinement who had both been convicted of an `aggravated felony' and were determined to pose a threat to public safety. 606 F.Supp.3d 437, 454 (SD Tex. 2022) (internal quotation marks omitted), see § 1101(a)(43) (defining aggravated felony). This prioritization was inconsistent with the § 1226(c) arrest mandate, which extends to all aliens convicted of any crime within a long list of statutory categories. 606 F.Supp.3d at 454-455.",Alito,0,
2022-062,154,"In February, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an arm of DHS, issued a second memorandum that slightly modified the earlier priorities and stated that `preapproval' would generally be required for enforcement actions against persons outside these priority groups. Id., at 455-456. This memorandum was also inconsistent with the relevant statutes.",Alito,0,
2022-062,155,"After some litigation regarding these two memoranda, a new DHS Secretary issued a Final Memorandum instructing that even aliens in priority groups need not necessarily be apprehended and removed. App. 113-115. Rather, the Final Memorandum directed DHS personnel to consider non-statutory aggravating and mitigating factors in deciding whether to detain an alien. Id., at 114-115. It further stated that DHS personnel should not rely on the fact of a qualifying conviction when exercising prosecutorial discretion. Id., at 115. Thus, the Final Memorandum did not simply permit deviations from the statutory mandates, it flatly contradicted those mandates by stating that qualifying convictions were insufficient grounds for initiating arrest, detention, and removal.",Alito,0,
2022-062,157,"Texas and Louisiana challenged this Final Memorandum in federal court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After a 2-day bench trial, the District Court found in favor of the States and made detailed findings of fact that bear on the issue of standing.",Alito,0,
2022-062,158,"Much of the District Court's analysis of that issue focused on the Final Memorandum's effect on the detainer system, 606 F.Supp.3d at 459-463, and it is therefore important to understand how that system works in relation to the relevant statutory provisions. When an alien in state custody for a criminal offense is identified as falling within a category of aliens whose apprehension and detention is required by §§ 1226(a) and (c), the Government should lodge a detainer with the State so that the Government can take the alien into custody when he or she is released by the  State. Then, when an alien is about to be released, a cooperative State will notify DHS so that it can be ready to assume its obligation under §§ 1226(a) and (c) to take the alien into federal custody. When that occurs, the State is spared the burdens it would have to bear if the alien, after release, had been placed under state law on probation, parole, or supervised release. But if DHS rescinds a detainer before such an alien is released (or never lodges a detainer in the first place), those burdens fall on the State.",Alito,0,
2022-062,159,"After reviewing the parties' evidence, the District Court found that in the first month after the substantive policy change brought about by the January 2021 DHS memorandum, ICE had rescinded 141 detainers in Texas.3 Ninety-five of the criminal aliens whose detainers were rescinded were then released on a form of state supervision. Seventeen of them went on to violate their terms of supervision, and four committed new crimes. Id., at 459.",Alito,0,
2022-062,160,"The court then examined what had taken place during just the time since the Final Memorandum became effective and found that because of the Final Memorandum, ICE had continued to rescind detainers placed on criminal aliens in Texas's custody, and the court identified 15 specific cases in which this had occurred. Id., at 460. Rejecting the Government's claim that these dropped detainers were necessary in light of limited resources, the court found that the Government  persistently underutilized existing detention facilities during the relevant time and that the average daily detained population in April 2022 was less than 40% of the 3-year high in August 2019. Id., at 453, 481, 488.",Alito,0,
2022-062,161,"Based on these findings of fact and historical data, the District Court identified four categories of costs that Texas had suffered and would continue to bear as a result of the relevant DHS actions. First, the court calculated the dollars-and-cents cost that Texas had to bear in order to supervise criminal aliens who were released in violation of §§ 1226(a), (c). Id., at 463. Second, it noted the costs associated with criminal recidivism. Id., at 464. Third, it found that some juvenile offenders who are not detained by ICE because of the Final Memorandum will attend Texas public schools (and at least one juvenile due to be released will do so). Ibid. Fourth, it concluded that the hundreds of millions of dollars that Texas annually spends on healthcare for illegal aliens would increase when some criminal aliens not detained because of the Final Memorandum make use of those services. Id., at 465.",Alito,0,
2022-062,162,"Concluding that these costs established Texas's injury for standing purposes, the District Court went on to hold that the Final Memorandum was contrary to law and that Texas had therefore established a violation of the APA.4 As I will explain, it is a common practice for courts in APA cases to set aside an improper final agency action, and that is what the District Court did here. It vacated the Final Memorandum pending further action by DHS, id., at 499, but it declined to issue injunctive or declaratory relief, id., at 501-502.",Alito,0,
2022-062,163,"The Government asked the Court of Appeals to stay the District Court's order vacating the Final Memorandum, but that court refused to do so and observed that the Government had not come close to showing `clear error' in the District Court's factual findings on the injuries that Texas had already incurred and would continue to incur because of the Final Memorandum. 40 F.4th 205, 216-217 (CA5 2022).",Alito,0,
2022-062,165,"Before I address the Court's inexplicable break from our ordinary standing analysis, I will first explain why Texas easily met its burden to show a concrete, particularized injury that is traceable to the Final Memorandum and redressable by the courts. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.",Alito,0,
2022-062,167,"Injury in fact. The District Court's factual findings, which must be accepted unless clearly erroneous, quantified the cost of criminal supervision of aliens who should have been held in DHS custody and also identified other burdens that Texas had borne and would continue to bear going forward. These findings sufficed to establish a concrete injury that was specific to Texas. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2204, 210 L.Ed.2d 568 (2021), see ante, at 1969-1970 (conceding that such costs are of course an injury).",Alito,0,
2022-062,168,"Traceability. The District Court found that each category of cost would increase because of the Final Memorandum, rather than decisions that DHS personnel would make irrespective of the directions that memorandum contains. 606 F.Supp.3d at 460, 464, 465 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-062,169,"The majority does not hold—and in my judgment, could not plausibly hold—that these findings are clearly erroneous. Instead, it observes only that a State's claim for standing can become more attenuated when based on the indirect effects of federal policies on state revenues or state spending. Ante, at 1972, n. 3. But while it is certainly true that indirect injuries may be harder to prove, an indirect financial injury that is proved at trial supports standing. And that is what happened here. As Justice GORSUCH notes, just a few years ago, we found in a very important case that a State had standing based in part on indirect financial injury. Ante, at 1977 (opinion concurring in judgment) (citing Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ _ ___, 139 S.Ct. 2551, 2565-66, 204 L.Ed.2d 978 (2019)). There is no justification for a conflicting holding here.",Alito,0,
2022-062,170,"In any event, many of the costs in this case are not indirect. When the Federal Government refuses or fails to comply with §§ 1226(a) and (c) as to criminal aliens, the direct result in many cases is that the State must continue its supervision. As noted, the District Court made specific findings about the financial cost that Texas incurred as a result of DHS's failure to assume custody of aliens covered by §§ 1226(a) and (c). And the costs that a State must bear when it is required to assume the supervision of criminal aliens who should be kept in federal custody are not only financial. Criminal aliens whom DHS unlawfully refuses to detain may be placed on state probation, parole, or supervised release, and some will commit new crimes and end up in a state jail or prison. Probation, parole, and corrections officers are engaged in dangerous work that can put their lives on the line.",Alito,0,
2022-062,171,"Redressability. A court order that forecloses reliance on the memorandum would likely redress the States' injuries. If, as the District Court found, DHS personnel rescind detainers because of the Final  Memorandum, then vacating that memorandum would likely lead to those detainers' remaining in place.",Alito,0,
2022-062,173,"While the majority does not contest redressability, Justice GORSUCH's concurrence does, citing two reasons. But the first is contrary to precedent, and the second should not be addressed in this case.",Alito,0,
2022-062,174,"The first asserted reason is based on the inability of the lower courts to issue a broad injunction forbidding enforcement of the Final Memorandum. See § 1252(f)(1).5 In this case, the District Court did not issue injunctive relief. Instead, it vacated the Final Memorandum, and Justice GORSUCH argues that this relief did not redress Texas's injuries because it does not require federal officials to change how they exercise their prosecutorial discretion in the Final Memorandum's Guidelines' absence. Ante, at 1979. There are two serious problems with this argument.",Alito,0,
2022-062,175,"First, § 1252(f)(1) bars injunctive relief by courts other than the Supreme Court. (Emphasis added.) As a result, redress in the form of an injunction can be awarded by this Court. According to the Court's decision last Term in Biden v. Texas, our authority to grant such relief left no doubt as to our jurisdiction even if § 1252(f)(1) precluded the lower courts from setting aside an administrative action under the APA. 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct. at 2539. We have not been asked to revisit this holding, see id., at ___ _ ___, 142 S.Ct. at 2535-36 (BARRETT, J., dissenting), and I would not do so here.",Alito,0,
2022-062,176,"Second, even if Biden v. Texas could be distinguished and no injunctive relief can be awarded by any court, setting aside the Final Memorandum satisfies the redressability requirement. Our decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 112 S.Ct. 2767, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992), settles that question. There, the Court held that a declaratory judgment regarding the lawfulness of Executive Branch action satisfied redressability because it was substantially likely that the President and other executive  officials would abide by an authoritative interpretation of the law even though they would not be directly bound by such a determination. Id., at 803, 112 S.Ct. 2767 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).6 Here, we need not speculate about how DHS officers would respond to vacatur of the Final Memorandum because the District Court found that the DHS personnel responsible for detainers were rescinding them because of the Final Memorandum. 606 F.Supp.3d at 460. This point was effectively conceded by the Government's application for an emergency stay pending our decision in this case. The Government argued that the Final Memorandum was needed to guide prosecutorial discretion, Application 38-39, and if the District Court's order were ineffectual, that would not be true. For these reasons, the harm resulting from the Final Memorandum  is redressed by setting aside the Final Memorandum.",Alito,0,
2022-062,177,"As to the concurrence's second argument —that the APA's set aside language may not permit vacatur—the concurrence acknowledges that this would be a sea change in administrative law as currently practiced in the lower courts. Ante, at 1984-1985 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.), see, e.g., Data Marketing Partnership, LP v. United States Dept. of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (CA5 2022) (The default rule is that vacatur is the appropriate remedy under the APA), United Steel v. Mine Safety and Health Admin., 925 F.3d 1279, 1287 (CADC 2019) (The ordinary practice is to vacate unlawful agency action).7 We did not grant review on this very consequential question, and I would not reach out to decide it in a case in which Biden v. Texas resolves the issue of redressability.",Alito,0,
2022-062,178,"To be clear, I would be less troubled than I am today if Justice GORSUCH's concurrence had commanded a majority. At least then, Congress would be free to amend § 1252(f). But the majority reaches out and redefines our understanding of the constitutional limits on otherwise-available lawsuits. It is to this misunderstanding that I now turn.",Alito,0,
2022-062,180,"The majority adopts the remarkable rule that injuries from an executive decision not to arrest or prosecute, even in a civil case, are generally not cognizable. Ante, at 1969-1970 (internal quotation marks omitted). Its reasoning has three failings. First, it fails to engage with contrary precedent that is squarely on point. Second, it lacks support in the cases on which it relies. Third, the exceptions (or possible exceptions) that it notes do nothing to allay concern about the majority's break from our established test for Article III standing. I address each of these problems in turn.",Alito,0,
2022-062,182,"Prior to today's decision, it was established law that plaintiffs who suffer a traditional injury resulting from an agency decision not to proceed with an enforcement action have Article III standing. Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 19, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998). The obvious parallel to the case before us is Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007), which has been called the most important environmental law case ever decided by the Court. R. Lazarus, The Rule of Five: Making Climate History at the Supreme Court 1 (2020). In that prior case, Massachusetts challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to use its civil enforcement powers to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that allegedly injured the Commonwealth. Massachusetts argued that it was harmed because the accumulation of greenhouse gases would lead to higher temperatures, higher temperatures would cause the oceans to rise, and rising sea levels would cause the Commonwealth to lose some of its dry land. The Court noted that Massachusetts had a quasi-sovereign interest in avoiding the loss of territory and that our federalist system  had stripped the Commonwealth of certain sovereign prerogatives that it could have otherwise employed to defend its interests. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 519-520, 127 S.Ct. 1438. Proclaiming that Massachusetts' standing claim was entitled to special solicitude, the Court held that the Commonwealth had standing. Id., at 520, 127 S.Ct. 1438.",Alito,0,
2022-062,183,"The reasoning in that case applies with at least equal force in the case at hand. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court suggested that allowing Massachusetts to protect its sovereign interests through litigation compensated for its inability to protect those interests by the means that would have been available had it not entered the Union. In the present case, Texas's entry into the Union stripped it of the power that it undoubtedly enjoyed as a sovereign nation to police its borders and regulate the entry of aliens. The Constitution and federal immigration laws have taken away most of that power, but the statutory provisions at issue in this case afford the State at least some protection—in particular by preventing the State and its residents from bearing the costs, financial and non-financial, inflicted by the release of certain dangerous criminal aliens. Our law on standing should not deprive the State of even that modest protection. We should not treat Texas less favorably than Massachusetts. And even if we do not view Texas's standing argument with any special solicitude, we should at least refrain from treating it with special hostility by failing to apply our standard test for Article III standing.",Alito,0,
2022-062,184,"Despite the clear parallel with this case and the States' heavy reliance on Massachusetts throughout their briefing, the majority can only spare a passing footnote for that important precedent. Ante, at 1975, n. 6, see Brief for Respondents 11, 12, 14, 16-18, 23, see also Brief for Arizona and 17 Other States as Amici Curiae 7-12. It first declines to say Massachusetts was correctly decided and references the disagreements that some may have with that decision. Ante, at 1975, n. 6. But it then concludes that Massachusetts does not control since the decision itself refers to `key differences between a denial of a petition for rulemaking and an agency's decision not to initiate an enforcement action,' with the latter `not ordinarily subject to judicial review.' Ante, at 1975, n. 6 (quoting 549 U.S. at 527, 127 S.Ct. 1438) (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-062,185,"The problem with this argument is that the portion of Massachusetts to which the footnote refers deals not with its key Article III holding, but with the scope of review that is ordinarily available under the statutory scheme. Importantly, Massachusetts frames its statement about declining enforcement as restating the rule of Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). See 549 U.S. at 527, 127 S.Ct. 1438. And as the Court acknowledges when it invokes Heckler directly, that decision is not about standing, it is about the interpretation of the statutory exception to APA review for actions committed to agency discretion by law. 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), see 470 U.S. at 823, 105 S.Ct. 1649, ante, at 1973-1974. And even in that context, Heckler expressly contemplates that any presumption of discretion to withhold enforcement can be rebutted by an express statutory limitation of discretion —which is exactly what we have here. 470 U.S. at 832-833, 105 S.Ct. 1649.",Alito,0,
2022-062,186,"So rather than answering questions about this case, the majority's footnote on Massachusetts raises more questions about Massachusetts itself—most importantly, has this monumental decision been quietly interred? Cf. ante, at 1977 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment).",Alito,0,
2022-062,187,"Massachusetts v. EPA is not the only relevant precedent that the Court brushes aside. It is well established that this Court has an independent obligation to assure that standing exists, regardless of whether it is challenged by any of the parties. Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 499, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 173 L.Ed.2d 1 (2009). Yet in case after case, with that obligation in mind, we have not questioned the standing of States that brought suit under the APA to compel civil enforcement.",Alito,0,

S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 2367, 207 L.Ed.2d 819 (2020), two States sued under the APA and sought to compel the Department of Health and Human Services to cease exercising regulatory enforcement discretion that exempted certain religious employers from compliance with a contraceptive-coverage mandate. Id., at ___ _ ___, 140 S.Ct. at 2378-79. The issue of the States' standing was discussed at length in the decision below, see Pennsylvania v. President United States, 930 F.3d 543, 561-565 (CA3 2019), and in this Court, no Justice suggested that the Constitution foreclosed standing simply because the States were complaining of the Executive Branch's enforcement choices regarding third parties. Ante, at 1971-1972.",Alito,0,
2022-062,189,"Just last Term in Biden v. Texas, two States argued that their spending on the issuance of driver's licenses and the provision of healthcare for illegal immigrants sufficed to establish Article III standing and thus enabled them to sue to compel enforcement of a detain-or-return mandate. See Texas v. Biden, 20 F.4th 928, 970-971 (CA5 2021). The Court of Appeals held that the States had standing, ibid., and the majority in this Court, despite extended engagement with other jurisdictional questions, never hinted that Article III precluded the States' suit. 597 U. S., at ___ _ ___, 142 S.Ct. at 2538-41.",Alito,0,
2022-062,190,"If the new rule adopted by the Court in this case is sound, these decisions and others like them were all just wasted ink. I understand that what we have called `drive-by jurisdictional rulings' are not precedents, see Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 511, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006), but the Court should not use a practice of selective silence to accept or reject prominently presented standing arguments on inconsistent grounds.",Alito,0,
2022-062,192,"Examination of the precedents the majority invokes only underscores the deficiencies in its analysis.8 The majority says that the leading precedent supporting its holding is Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). Ante, at 1970-1971. But as Justice BARRETT notes, this Court has already definitively explained that the suit to compel prosecution in Linda R. S. was rejected because of the unlikelihood that the relief requested would redress appellant's claimed injury. Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 79, n. 24, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978), see ante, at 1986-1987 (opinion concurring in judgment).",Alito,0,
2022-062,193,"The Court notes in a quick parenthetical that the Linda R. S. principle was once cited  in the immigration context in Sure-Tan, Inc. v.

Sure-Tan only rejected (quite reasonably) any standalone cognizable interest in procuring enforcement of the immigration laws by a party who lacked any personal interest. Ibid. (emphasis added). And it did so, not as part of a standing analysis, but as part of its explanation for rejecting two employers' attempt to assert that seeking to have employees deported as retaliation for union activity was an aspect of their First Amendment right `to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' Id., at 896, 104 S.Ct. 2803.",Alito,0,
2022-062,194,"After these two inapposite precedents, the majority's authority gets even weaker. I agree with Justice BARRETT that neither Heckler, nor Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005), has real relevance here. Ante, at 1988-1989. Castle Rock considered the deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion as a tool for interpreting a statute, not as a constitutional standing rule. 545 U.S. at 761, 125 S.Ct. 2796. And as explained above, Heckler is not about standing and only states a presumptive rule. The Court's remaining authorities are likewise consistent with the understanding that prosecution decisions are generally committed to an agency's absolute discretion unless the relevant law rebuts the presumption. Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831, 105 S.Ct. 1649 (emphasis added). For example, TransUnion states that it is only when unharmed plaintiffs are before the Court that Article III forecloses interference with the discretion of the Executive Branch. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct. at 2207 (emphasis deleted).",Alito,0,
2022-062,195,"In sum, all of these authorities point, not to the majority's new rule, but to the same ordinary questions we ask in every case— whether the plaintiff has a concrete, traceable, and redressable injury.",Alito,0,
2022-062,197,"Despite the majority's capacious understanding of executive discretion, today's opinion assures the reader that the decision does not suggest that federal courts may never entertain cases involving the Executive Branch's alleged failure to make more arrests or bring more prosecutions, despite its otherwise broad language covering the exercise of enforcement discretion over whether to arrest or prosecute. Ante, at 1970-1971, 1972-1973. The majority lists five categories of cases in which a court would—or at least might— have Article III jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to arrest or prosecution policies, but this list does nothing to allay concern about the Court's new path. The Court does not identify any characteristics that are shared by all these categories and that distinguish them from cases in which it would not find standing. In addition, the Court is unwilling to say that cases in four of these five categories are actually exempted from its general rule, and the one remaining category is exceedingly small. I will discuss these categories one by one.",Alito,0,
2022-062,198,"First, the majority distinguishes selective-prosecution suits by a plaintiff to prevent his or her own prosecution, ante, at 1972-1973. But such claims are ordinarily brought as defenses in ongoing prosecutions, as in the cases the Court cites, and are rarely brought in standalone actions where a plaintiff must prove standing. This category is therefore little more than a footnote to the Court's general rule.",Alito,0,
2022-062,199,"Second, the majority grants that the standing analysis might differ when Congress elevates de facto injuries to the status of legally cognizable injuries, and it hypothesizes a situation in which Congress (i) specifically authorizes suits against  the Executive Branch by a defined set of plaintiffs who have suffered concrete harms from executive under-enforcement and (ii) specifically authorizes the Judiciary to enter appropriate orders requiring additional arrests or prosecutions by the Executive Branch. Ante, at 1973 (emphasis added). It is puzzling why the presence or absence of such a statute should control the question of standing under the Constitution. We have said that the enactment of a statute may help us to determine in marginal cases whether an injury is sufficiently concrete and particularized to satisfy the first prong of our three-part standing test. Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016). But once it is posited that a plaintiff has personally suffered a de facto injury, i.e., an injury in fact, it is hard to see why the presence or absence of a statute authorizing suit has a bearing on the question whether the court has Article III jurisdiction as opposed to the question whether the plaintiff has a cause of action. In the end, however, none of this may matter because the majority suggests that such a statute might be unconstitutional. Ante, at 1973, and n. 4.",Alito,0,
2022-062,200,"Third, the majority tells us that the standing outcome might change if the Federal Government wholly abandoned its statutory responsibilities, but that statement is both equivocal and vague. Ante, at 1973-1974 (emphasis added). Under what circumstances might the Court say that the Federal Government has wholly abandoned its enforcement duties? Suppose the Federal Government announced that it would obey 80% of the immigration laws or 70% of the environmental laws. Would the Court say that it had wholly abandoned enforcement of these bodies of law? What would happen if the Final Memorandum in this case had directed DHS agents not to arrest anyone convicted of any covered crime other than murder? DHS would still be enforcing the arrest mandate as to one of the many covered crimes. Would this only-murder policy qualify as complete abandonment? And why should the ability of a particular party to seek legal redress for an injury turn on the number of others harmed by the challenged enforcement policy? Standing is assessed plaintiff by plaintiff. The majority has no answers, and in the end, it cannot even bring itself to commit to this complete-abandonment exception. It says only that the standing calculus might or arguably could change. Ibid. (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-062,201,"Fourth, the Court says that a plaintiff might have standing to challenge an Executive Branch's arrest or prosecution priorities and the Executive Branch's provision of legal benefits or legal status  because the challenged policy might implicate more than simply the Executive's traditional enforcement discretion. Ibid. Exactly what this means is not easy to ascertain. One possibility is that the majority is talking about a complaint that asserts separate claims based on the grant or denial of benefits, the grant or denial of legal status, and harms resulting from non-enforcement of a statutory mandate. In that event, standing with respect to each claim would have to be analyzed separately. Another possibility is that the majority is referring to a claim asserting that non-enforcement of a statutory requirement requiring the arrest or prosecution of third parties resulted in the plaintiff's loss of benefits or legal status. Such a situation is not easy to imagine, and the majority cites no case that falls within this category. But if such a case were to arise, there is no reason why it should not be analyzed under our standard three-pronged test.",Alito,0,
2022-062,202,"Fifth, and finally, the majority states that policies governing the continued detention  of noncitizens who have already been arrested arguably might raise a different standing question than arrest or prosecution policies. Ante, at 1974 (emphasis added). The majority provides no explanation for this (noncommittal) distinction, and in any event, as the majority acknowledges, the States in this case challenged noncompliance with the § 1231(a)(2) detention mandate in addition to the § 1226(c) arrest requirement. Ante, at 1968-1969, 1975. The Court points to what it sees as a representation by the Solicitor General that the Final Memorandum does not affect continued detention of noncitizens already in federal custody. Ante, at 1974 n. 5. But as Justice BARRETT notes, the Government argued that when it chooses not to remove someone under the Final Memorandum's guidance, its mandatory detention obligation ends— meaning it is asserting discretion over continued detention. Ante, at 1987-1988 (opinion concurring in judgment).",Alito,0,
2022-062,203,"In any event, arrest policy cannot be divided from detention policy in this case. When a person is arrested, he or she is detained for at least some period of time, and under the detainer system involved here, arrest often simply means transferring an immigrant from state custody to federal custody. As best I can tell, the majority's distinction between arrest and detention is made solely to avoid the obvious inference that our decision last Term in Biden v. Texas should have dismissed the case for lack of standing, without analyzing the Government's detention obligations. 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct. at 2541.",Alito,0,
2022-062,204,"In sum, with the exception of cases in the first (very small) category (civil cases involving selective-prosecution claims), the majority does not identify any category of cases that it would definitely except from its general rule. In addition, category two conflates the question of constitutional standing with the question whether the plaintiff has a cause of action, category three is hopelessly vague, category four is incomprehensible, and category five actually encompasses the case before us.",Alito,0,
2022-062,206,"The Court declares that its decision upholds our constitutional system of separation of powers, ante, at 1973, but as I said at the outset, the decision actually damages that system by improperly inflating the power of the Executive and cutting back the power of Congress and the authority of the Judiciary. And it renders States already laboring under the effects of massive illegal immigration even more helpless.",Alito,0,
2022-062,207,"Our Constitution gives the President important powers, and the precise extent of some of them has long been the subject of contention, but it has been widely accepted that the President's power reaches `its lowest ebb' when he contravenes the express will of Congress, `for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.' Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 61, 135 S.Ct. 2076, 192 L.Ed.2d 83 (2015) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637-638, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)).",Alito,0,
2022-062,208,"That is the situation here. To put the point simply, Congress enacted a law that requires the apprehension and detention of certain illegal aliens whose release, it thought, would endanger public safety. The Secretary of DHS does not agree with that categorical requirement. He prefers a more flexible policy. And the Court's answer today is that the Executive's policy choice prevails unless Congress, by withholding funds, refusing to confirm Presidential nominees, threatening impeachment  and removal, etc., can win a test of strength. Relegating Congress to these disruptive measures radically alters the balance of power between Congress and the Executive, as well as the allocation of authority between the Congress that enacts a law and a later Congress that must go to war with the Executive if it wants that law to be enforced.9",Alito,0,
2022-062,209,"What the majority has done is to apply Oliver Wendell Holmes's bad-man theory of the law to the separation of powers. Under Holmes's theory, as popularly understood, the law consists of those things that a bad man cannot get away with.10 Similarly, the majority's understanding of the executive Power seems to be that a President can disobey statutory commands unless Congress, by flexing its muscles, forces capitulation. That is not the Constitution's conception of the executive Power. Art. II, § 1. The Constitution, instead, requires a President to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. § 3 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2022-062,210,"Neither the Solicitor General nor the majority has cited any support for the proposition that a President has the power to disobey statutes that require him to take enforcement actions, and there is strong historical evidence to the contrary.11 The majority's conception of Presidential authority smacks of the powers that English monarchs claimed prior to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, namely, the power to suspend the operation of existing statutes, and to grant dispensations from compliance with statutes.12 After James II was deposed, that changed. The English Bill of Rights of 1689 emphatically rejected the pretended Power of Suspending of Laws or the Execution of Laws by Regal Authority without Consent of Parliament and the pretended Power of Dispensing with Laws or the Execution of Laws by Regal Authority as it has been assumed and exercised of late.13",Alito,0,
2022-062,211,"By the time of the American Revolution, British monarchs had long abandoned the power to resist laws enacted by Parliament,14 but the Declaration of Independence charged George III with exercising those powers with respect to colonial enactments. One of the leading charges against him was that he had forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and  pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended,  had utterly neglected to attend to them.15",Alito,0,
2022-062,212,"By 1787, six State Constitutions contained provisions prohibiting the suspension of laws,16 and at the Constitutional Convention, a proposal to grant the President suspending authority was unanimously defeated.17 Many scholars have concluded that the Take Care Clause was meant to repudiate that authority.18 See 1 Works of James Wilson 399, 440 (R. McCloskey ed. 1967) (describing Clause as providing that the President holds authority, not to make, or alter, or dispense with the laws, but to execute and act the laws).",Alito,0,
2022-062,213,"Early decisions are inconsistent with the understanding of Executive Power that appears to animate the majority. In 1806, Justice Patterson, while presiding over a criminal trial, rejected the argument that the President could authorize the defendant to violate the law. United States v. Smith, 27 F.Cas. 1192, 1201, (No. 16,342) (CC NY 1806). He concluded:",Alito,0,
2022-062,214,"The president of the United States cannot control the statute, nor dispense with its execution, and still less can he authorize a person to do what the law forbids. If he could, it would render the execution of the laws dependent on his will and pleasure, which is a doctrine that has not been set up, and will not meet with any supporters in our government. In this particular, the law is paramount. Id., at 1230.",Alito,0,
2022-062,215,"In Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. 12 Pet. 524, 9 L.Ed. 1181 (1838), the full Court rejected the President's claim that he had the authority to disregard a statutory duty to pay certain sums to a government contractor: To contend that the obligations imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and is entirely inadmissible. Id., at 613. This Court made the obvious connection to the separation of powers: vesting in the President a dispensing power would result in clothing the President with a power entirely to control the legislation of congress, and paralyze the administration of justice. Ibid., see also Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496  U.S. 414, 435, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990) (White, J., concurring) (citing Kendall to explain that the Executive Branch does not have the dispensing power on its own and should not be granted such a power by judicial authorization).",Alito,0,
2022-062,216,"The original understanding of the scope of the Executive's prosecutorial discretion was not briefed in this case, and I am reluctant to express a firm position on the question. But it is indisputable that we have been provided with no historical support for the position taken by the Solicitor General or the majority.* * *",Alito,0,
2022-062,217,"This sweeping Executive Power endorsed by today's decision may at first be warmly received by champions of a strong Presidential power, but if Presidents can expand their powers as far as they can manage in a test of strength with Congress, presumably Congress can cut executive power as much as it can manage by wielding the formidable weapons at its disposal. That is not what the Constitution envisions.",Alito,0,
2022-062,218,"I end with one final observation. The majority suggests that its decision rebuffs an effort to convince us to `usurp' the authority of the other branches, but that is not true. Ante, at 1969. We exercise the power conferred by Article III of the Constitution, and we must be vigilant not to exceed the limits of our constitutional role. But when we have jurisdiction, we have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise that authority. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). Because the majority shuns that duty, I must respectfully dissent.",Alito,0,
