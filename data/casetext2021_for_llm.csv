2021-001,24,"In the course of one evening, William Dale Wooden burglarized ten units in a single storage facility. He later pleaded guilty, for that night's work, to ten counts of burglary—one for each storage unit he had entered. Some two decades later, the courts below concluded that those convictions were enough to subject Wooden to enhanced criminal penalties under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). That statute mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for unlawful gun possession when the offender has three or more prior convictions for violent felonies like burglary committed on occasions different from one another. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). The question presented is whether Wooden's prior convictions were for offenses occurring on different occasions, as the lower courts held, because the burglary of each unit happened at a distinct point in time, rather than simultaneously. The answer is no. Convictions arising from a single criminal episode, in the way Wooden's did, can count only once under ACCA.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,26,"Begin in 1997, when Wooden and three confederates unlawfully entered a one-building storage facility at 100 Williams Road in Dalton, Georgia, next door to Wooden's home. The burglars proceeded from unit to unit within the facility, crushing the interior drywall between them. App. 32 (indictment), see Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 6a (statement of Assistant District Attorney at plea hearing) (Once they made entry into the facility, they burrowed through from  unit to unit). The men stole items from, all told, ten different storage units. So Georgia prosecutors charged them with ten counts of burglary—though, as state law prescribes, in a single indictment. See Ga. Code Ann. § 16-1-7(b) (1996) (requiring crimes arising from the same conduct to be prosecuted together). Wooden pleaded guilty to all counts. The judge sentenced him to eight years' imprisonment for each conviction, with the ten terms to run concurrently.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,27,"Fast forward now to a cold November morning in 2014, when Wooden responded to a police officer's knock on his door. The officer asked to speak with Wooden's wife. And noting the chill in the air, the officer asked if he could step inside, to stay warm. Wooden agreed. But his good deed did not go unpunished. Once admitted to the house, the officer spotted several guns. Knowing that Wooden was a felon, the officer placed him under arrest. A jury later convicted him for being a felon in  possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).",Kagan,0,
2021-001,28,"The penalty for that crime varies significantly depending on whether ACCA applies. Putting ACCA aside, the maximum sentence for violating § 922(g) is ten years in prison. See § 924(a)(2). But ACCA mandates a minimum sentence of fifteen years if the § 922(g) offender has three prior convictions for violent felonies (like burglary) or serious drug offenses that were committed on occasions different from one another. § 924(e)(1). In Wooden's own case, the record reveals the discrepancy as especially stark. Before the Government decided to seek an ACCA enhancement, its Probation Office recommended a sentence of 21 to 27 months. See App. 38-39, 42. The ACCA minimum sentence is about 13 years longer.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,29,"The District Court's sentencing hearing focused on whether Wooden's ten convictions for breaking into the storage facility sufficed to trigger ACCA. Wooden said they did not because he had burglarized the ten storage units on a single occasion, rather than on occasions different from one another. § 924(e)(1). The burglaries, he explained, happened during the same criminal episode, at the same business location, under the same roof. App. 50. And given those facts, he continued, the burglaries were charged in a single indictment. Ibid. But the District Court accepted the Government's view that every time Wooden busted into another storage unit, he commenced a new occasion of criminal activity. The court reasoned, relying on Circuit precedent, that the entry into each separate unit provides a discrete point at which the first offense was completed and the second began and so on. Id., at 59. Based on the ACCA enhancement, the court sentenced Wooden to 188 months (almost 16 years) in prison for unlawfully possessing a gun.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,30,"The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the sentence, on the same reasoning. It is possible, the court stated, to discern the point at which Wooden's first offense was completed and the subsequent point at which his second offense began. 945 F.3d 498, 505 (2019). After all, Wooden could not be in two (let alone ten) of the storage units at once. Ibid. In the court's view, the sequential nature of Wooden's crimes—his progression from one unit in the storage facility to the next to the next—meant that the crimes were committed on occasions different from one another. And so, the court concluded, Wooden qualified as a career offender under ACCA.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,31,"The Courts of Appeals have divided over the meaning of ACCA's occasions clause. Some Circuits, like the Sixth, deem the clause satisfied whenever crimes take place at different moments in time—that is, sequentially rather than simultaneously.1 Other Circuits undertake a more holistic inquiry, considering not merely the precise timing but also other circumstances of the crimes.2 We granted certiorari, 592 U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 1370, 209 L.Ed.2d 118 (2021), to resolve that split of authority.3  II",Kagan,0,
2021-001,32,"Framed in terms of this case, the disputed question is whether Wooden committed his crimes on a single occasion or on ten separate ones.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,33,"The Government answers ten, relying on a legally fancified version of the Sixth Circuit's timing test. In the ACCA context, the Government argues, an occasion happens at a particular point in time—the moment when an offense's elements are established. Brief for United States 9. So offenses occur on different `occasions' when the criminal conduct necessary to satisfy the offense elements occurs at different times. Id., at 13. Applying that elements-based, temporal-distinctness test to this case, the Government explains that Wooden's burglaries were quintessentially sequential, rather than simultaneous. Id., at 10, 20. After all, a person can satisfy the elements of burglary only by entering (or remaining in) a structure with criminal intent. See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. § 16-7-1(a). And it would have been physically impossible for Wooden to have entered (or remained in) multiple storage units at once. Brief for United States 12. Each of Wooden's ten entries thus counts (so says the Government) as another occasion, triggering ACCA's stringent penalties more than three times over.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,34,"We think not. The ordinary meaning of the word occasion—essentially an episode or event—refutes the Government's single-minded focus on whether a crime's elements were established at a discrete moment in time. And ACCA's history and purpose do so too: The origin of the occasions clause confirms that multiple crimes may occur on one occasion even if not at the same moment. Wooden's night of crime is a perfect case in point. His one-after-another-after-another burglary of ten units in a single storage facility occurred on one occasion, under a natural construction of that term and consistent with the reason it became part of ACCA.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,36,"Consider first how an ordinary person (a reporter, a police officer, yes, even a lawyer) might describe Wooden's ten burglaries —and how she would not. The observer might say: On one occasion, Wooden burglarized ten units in a storage facility. By contrast, she would never say: On ten occasions, Wooden burglarized a unit in the facility. Nor would she say anything like: On one occasion, Wooden burglarized a storage unit, on a second occasion, he burglarized another unit, on a third occasion, he burglarized yet another, and so on. She would, using language in its normal way, group his entries into the storage units, even though not simultaneous, all together—as happening on a single occasion, rather than on ten occasions different from one another. § 924(e)(1).",Kagan,0,
2021-001,37,"That usage fits the ordinary meaning of occasion. The word commonly refers to an event, occurrence, happening, or episode. See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 908 (1981), Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1560 (3d ed. 1986). And such an event, occurrence, happening, or episode—which is simply to say, such an occasion—may itself encompass multiple, temporally distinct activities. The occasion of a wedding, for example, often includes a ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. Those doings are proximate in time and place, and have a shared theme (celebrating the happy couple), their connections are, indeed, what makes them part of a single event. But they do not  occur at the same moment: The newlyweds would surely take offense if a guest organized a conga line in the middle of their vows. That is because an occasion may— and the hypothesized one does—encompass a number of non-simultaneous activities, it need not be confined to a single one.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,38,"The same is true (to shift gears from the felicitous to the felonious) when it comes to crime. In that sphere too, an occasion means an event or episode—which may, in common usage, include temporally discrete offenses. Consider a couple of descriptions from this Court's cases. On one occasion, we noted, Bryant hit his live-in girlfriend on the head with a beer bottle and attempted to strangle her. United States v. Bryant, 579 U.S. 140, 151, 136 S.Ct. 1954, 195 L.Ed.2d 317 (2016). On one occasion —regardless whether those acts occurred at once (as the Government would require) or instead succeeded one another. Ibid. Likewise, we said: The State has stipulated that the robbery and murder arose out of `the same set of facts, circumstances, and the same occasion.' Turner v. Arkansas, 407 U.S. 366, 368-369, 92 S.Ct. 2096, 32 L.Ed.2d 798 (1972) (per curiam). The same occasion—irrespective whether the murder took place during (as the Government insists on) or instead just after the robbery. Ibid. Or take a hypothetical suggested by oral argument here: A barroom brawl breaks out, and a patron hits first one, then another, and then a third of his fellow drinkers. The Government maintains those are not just three offenses (assaults) but also three occasions because they happened seriatim. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53, 61-62. But in making the leap from three offenses to three occasions, based on a split-second separation between punches, the Government leaves ordinary language behind. The occasion in the hypothetical is the barroom brawl, not each individual fisticuff.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,39,"By treating each temporally distinct offense as its own occasion, the Government goes far toward collapsing two separate statutory conditions. Recall that ACCA kicks in only if (1) a § 922(g) offender has previously been convicted of three violent felonies, and (2) those three felonies were committed on occasions different from one another. § 924(e)(1), see supra, at 1067-1068. In other words, the statute contains both a three-offense requirement and a three-occasion requirement. But under the Government's view, the two will generally boil down to the same thing: When an offender's criminal history meets the three-offense demand, it will also meet the three-occasion one. That is because people seldom commit—indeed, seldom can commit—multiple ACCA offenses at the exact same time. Take burglary. It is, just as the Government argues, physically impossible for an offender to enter different structures simultaneously. Brief for United States 16-17, see supra, at 1068. Or consider crimes defined by the use of physical force, such as assault or murder. Except in unusual cases (like a bombing), multiple offenses of that kind happen one by one by one, even if all occur in a short spell. The Government's reading, to be sure, does not render the occasions clause wholly superfluous, in select circumstances, a criminal may satisfy the elements of multiple offenses in a single instant. But for the most part, the Government's hyper-technical focus on the precise timing of elements—which can make someone a career criminal in the space of a minute—gives ACCA's three-occasions requirement no work to do.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,40,"The inquiry that requirement entails, given what occasion ordinarily means, is more multi-factored in nature. From the wedding to the barroom brawl, all the examples offered above suggest  that a range of circumstances may be relevant to identifying episodes of criminal activity. Timing of course matters, though not in the split-second, elements-based way the Government proposes. Offenses committed close in time, in an uninterrupted course of conduct, will often count as part of one occasion, not so offenses separated by substantial gaps in time or significant intervening events. Proximity of location is also important, the further away crimes take place, the less likely they are components of the same criminal event. And the character and relationship of the offenses may make a difference: The more similar or intertwined the conduct giving rise to the offenses—the more, for example, they share a common scheme or purpose —the more apt they are to compose one occasion.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,41,"For the most part, applying this approach will be straightforward and intuitive. In the Circuits that have used it, we can find no example (nor has the Government offered one) of judges coming out differently on similar facts. In many cases, a single factor—especially of time or place—can decisively differentiate occasions. Courts, for instance, have nearly always treated offenses as occurring on separate occasions if a person committed them a day or more apart, or at a significant distance. United States v. Rideout, 3 F.3d 32, 35 (CA2 1993), see, e.g., United States v. Riddle, 47 F.3d 460, 462 (CA1 1995) (per curiam). In other cases, the inquiry just as readily shows a single occasion, because all the factors cut that way. That is true, for example, in our barroom-brawl hypothetical, where the offender has engaged in a continuous stream of closely related criminal acts at one location. Of course, there will be some hard cases in between, as under almost any legal test. When that is so, assessing the relevant circumstances may also involve keeping an eye on ACCA's history and purpose, which we next discuss. See infra, at 1072-1074. But in law as in life, it is usually not so difficult to identify an occasion: Given that the term in ACCA has just its ordinary meaning, most cases should involve no extra-ordinary work.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,42,"And surely, this one does not. Here, every relevant consideration shows that Wooden burglarized ten storage units on a single occasion, even though his criminal activity resulted in double-digit convictions. Wooden committed his burglaries on a single night, in a single uninterrupted course of conduct. The crimes all took place at one location, a one-building storage facility with one address. Each offense was essentially identical, and all were intertwined with the others. The burglaries were part and parcel of the same scheme, actuated by the same motive, and accomplished by the same means. Indeed, each burglary in some sense facilitated the next, as Wooden moved from unit to unit to unit, all in a row. And reflecting all these facts, Georgia law treated the burglaries as integrally connected. Because they arose from the same conduct, the prosecutor had to charge all ten in a single indictment. Ga. Code Ann. § 16-1-7(b), see Morgan v. State, 220 Ga.App. 198, 199-200, 469 S.E.2d 340, 341-343 (1996) (holding that, under § 16-1-7(b), similar drug offenses had to be charged together because they occurred very close in time as part of an ongoing chain of events), supra, at 1067-1068. The indictment thus confirms what all the circumstances suggest: One criminal occasion notwithstanding ten crimes.4  B",Kagan,0,
2021-001,43,"Statutory history and purpose confirm our view of the occasions clause's meaning, as well as our conclusion that Wooden is not a career offender. For the first four years of its existence, ACCA asked only about offenses, not about occasions. Its enhanced penalties, that is, kicked in whenever a § 922(g) offender had three prior convictions for specified crimes—in the initial version, for robbery or burglary alone, and in the soon-amended version, for any violent felony or serious drug offense. See Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, § 1802, 98 Stat. 2185, Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, § 1402(a), 100 Stat. 3207-39. Congress added the occasions clause only after a court applied ACCA to an offender much like Wooden— a person convicted of multiple counts of robbery arising from a single criminal episode.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,44,"In that precipitating case, Samuel Petty received ACCA's minimum 15-year penalty for gun possession based on his earlier stickup of a Manhattan restaurant. Petty and three associates had entered the establishment brandishing an assortment of guns and ordered the patrons and employees to the floor. See Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 11a-12a (New York State's brief). The gunmen then made their way around the premises, collecting money and other valuables from the prostrate victims. See id., at 12a-17a. For his role in the crime, Petty was convicted of six counts of robbery—one count for each of six individuals whose property had been taken—and served concurrent 5-year sentences. See United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157, 1159-1160 (CA8 1986). Some years later, Petty was caught possessing a firearm and convicted of violating § 922(g). Federal prosecutors asked for heightened penalties under ACCA, pointing to his six robbery convictions from the restaurant incident. The District Court sentenced Petty on that basis, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. That court held it irrelevant under ACCA that the six convictions arose out of the same transaction. Id., at 1160.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,45,"But when Petty sought this Court's review, the Solicitor General confessed error, stating that ACCA should not be construed to reach multiple felony convictions arising out of a single criminal episode. Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 30a-31a. In taking that position—requiring the convictions to come instead from multiple criminal episodes—the Solicitor General could not rely on ACCA's text. Id., at 26a. He acknowledged that ACCA lacked language found in other penalty-enhancement laws requiring prior crimes to have occurred on occasions different from one another. Id., at 25a-26a (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3575(e)(1) (1982 ed.), 21 U.S.C. § 849(e)(1) (1982 ed.)). But in the Solicitor General's view, the legislative history showed that Congress intended ACCA to have the same scope as those other laws. The Solicitor General highlighted references throughout the legislative reports and the floor debates to `career criminals,' `repeat offenders,' `habitual offenders,' `recidivists,' `revolving door' offenders, and `three time losers.' Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 27a, and n. 6. Those references, along with the very title of the  Act—the Armed Career Criminal Act, made clear that the courts in Petty's case had read ACCA too broadly. Id., at 26a (internal quotation marks omitted). According to the Solicitor General, Petty's six robbery convictions—because they arose from a single criminal episode—should have counted as just one. In light of that changed position, this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration. Petty v. United States, 481 U.S. 1034, 1034-1035, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987). And this time, the Eighth Circuit found in Petty's favor. See United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (1987) (per curiam).",Kagan,0,
2021-001,46,"More important here, Congress amended ACCA to prevent future Pettys from being sentenced as career criminals. Just one year after the Solicitor General confessed error, Congress added the occasions clause—demanding, exactly as in the other laws he had cited, that the requisite prior crimes occur on occasions different from one another. Minor and Technical Criminal Law Amendments Act of 1988, § 7056, 102 Stat. 4402. In placing the amendment on the Senate calendar, Senator Robert Byrd introduced an analysis, on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, setting out the genesis and purpose of the new language. The proposed amendment, the analysis explained, would clarify the armed career criminal statute to reflect the Solicitor General's construction in Petty. 134 Cong. Rec. 13783 (1988). His interpretation plainly expresses, the analysis continued, what is meant by a `career criminal,' that is, a person who over the course of time commits three or more of the enumerated kinds of felonies. Ibid. The statement concluded that clarifying the statute in this regard would insure that its rigorous sentencing provisions apply only as intended in cases meriting such strict punishment. Ibid. Congress enacted the amendment with near-unanimous support. See 134 Cong. Rec. 24924, 30826, 32678, 33318.5",Kagan,0,
2021-001,47,"That statutory change, rejecting the original outcome in Petty in light of the Solicitor General's confession of error, is at odds with the Government's current view of the occasions clause. After all, that view does not (as the former Solicitor General's did) demand multiple criminal episodes as ordinarily understood: To the contrary, it enables ACCA to reach multiple felony convictions arising out of a single criminal episode so long as the crimes' elements are not satisfied at once. Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 26a, 31a (confession of error), see supra, at 1068-1069, 1070. To be sure, the Government proposes a way to reconcile its test with the rejection of the enhanced sentence given to Petty: The restaurant robberies, the Government says, happened on one occasion because the defendants ordered all the victims to turn over their belongings at once, under a continuous show of force, and multiple gunmen gathered the victims' items simultaneously. Brief for United States 25. But even if that is true—the briefs and opinions in the case do not clearly say—the Government's theory makes the how many occasions question turn on trifles. Suppose Petty and his cohorts had proceeded without all this purported simultaneity. Suppose they had robbed everyone in the dining room first, then everyone in the kitchen. Or suppose the robbers had gone from booth to booth to booth, turning their guns on their victims in turn. The  Government says that with any such sequencing, a different result would obtain. Ibid., see Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53, 60-62. What it does not do, except in the most technical sense, is explain why. Nothing about the Solicitor General's confession of error, or the action Congress took in its wake, suggests any concern for the exact ordering of Petty's actions. Each was based instead on another idea: A person who has robbed a restaurant, and done nothing else, is not a habitual offender or career criminal. Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 27a, see also 134 Cong. Rec. 13782-13783.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,48,"The history of the occasions clause thus aligns with what this Court has always recognized as ACCA's purpose. Congress enacted ACCA to address the special danger posed by the eponymous armed career criminal. Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 146, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). The theory of the statute is that those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood are especially likely to inflict grave harm when in possession of a firearm. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 587-588, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). And so the statute targets a particular subset of offenders—those who have repeatedly committed violent crimes. Begay, 553 U.S. at 147, 128 S.Ct. 1581. It was that focus on revolving door felons that the Solicitor General referenced in arguing that the courts in Petty had construed ACCA too broadly. See Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 27a, and n. 6, supra, at 1072-1073. And it was that focus to which Congress itself returned in adding the occasions clause—once again, to insure that ACCA's rigorous sentencing provisions apply only as intended in cases meriting such strict punishment. 134 Cong. Rec. 13783, see supra, at 1073.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,49,"Wooden's burglary of a storage facility does not create that kind of case, any more than Petty's robbery of a restaurant did. Wooden's convictions, much like Petty's, arose from a closely related set of acts occurring on the same night, at the same place—making up, just as the former Solicitor General said, a single criminal episode. Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 31a, see supra, at 1072-1073. Wooden did not become a career criminal when he moved from the second storage unit to the third, as Petty did not when he moved from the second to the third of the restaurant's patrons. Wooden and Petty both served significant sentences for their crimes, and rightly so. But in enacting the occasions clause, Congress made certain that crimes like theirs, taken alone, would not subject a person to a 15-year minimum sentence for illegally possessing a gun.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,51,"For the reasons stated, Wooden's ten burglary convictions were for offenses committed on a single occasion. They therefore count only once under ACCA. We reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Kagan,0,
2021-001,52,It is so ordered.,Kagan,0,
2021-001,53,"Justice SOTOMAYOR, concurring.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-001,54,"I join the opinion of the Court because on the facts of this case, it is clear that Wooden's prior convictions did not take place on occasions different from one another, as required for the sentencing enhancement to apply. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Justice GORSUCH raises questions about the clarity of the record below, but in my view, those questions only underscore the Government's failure to carry its burden of proving the enhancement's application. See Pereida v. Wilkinson, 592 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 754, 765, 209 L.Ed.2d 47 (2021) (citing Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-001,55,"133, 137, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010)). I agree with Justice GORSUCH, however, that the rule of lenity provides an independent basis for ruling in favor of a defendant in a closer case, and I join Parts II-IV of his opinion concurring in the judgment.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-001,56,"Justice KAVANAUGH, concurring.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,57,"I join the Court's opinion in full. In light of Justice GORSUCH's thoughtful concurrence in the judgment, I write separately to briefly explain why the rule of lenity has appropriately played only a very limited role in this Court's criminal case law. And I further explain how another principle— the presumption of mens rea—can address Justice GORSUCH's important concern, which I share, about fair notice in federal criminal law.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,58,"A common formulation of the rule of lenity is as follows: If a federal criminal statute is grievously ambiguous, then the statute should be interpreted in the criminal defendant's favor. See Ocasio v. United States, 578 U.S. 282, 295, n. 8, 136 S.Ct. 1423, 194 L.Ed.2d 520 (2016). Importantly, the rule of lenity does not apply when a law merely contains some ambiguity or is difficult to decipher. As this Court has often said, the rule of lenity applies only when `after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,' the statute is still grievously ambiguous. Ibid. (quoting Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 138-139, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998)), see Shular v. United States, 589 U.S. ___, ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 779, 787-88, 788-789, 206 L.Ed.2d 81 (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring). The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers. Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961). Our repeated use of the term grievous ambiguity underscores that point. See, e.g., Shaw v. United States, 580 U.S. 63, 71, 137 S.Ct. 462, 196 L.Ed.2d 373 (2016), Salman v. United States, 580 U.S. 39, 51, 137 S.Ct. 420, 196 L.Ed.2d 351 (2016), Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188, n. 10, 134 S.Ct. 2259, 189 L.Ed.2d 262 (2014).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,59,"Properly applied, the rule of lenity therefore rarely if ever plays a role because, as in other contexts, hard interpretive conundrums, even relating to complex rules, can often be solved. Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2400, 2415, 204 L.Ed.2d 841 (2019), see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). And if a reviewing court employs all of the traditional tools of construction, the court will almost always reach a conclusion about the best interpretation of the law at issue. Kisor, 588 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2448 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in judgment).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,60,"In short, because a court must exhaust all the tools of statutory interpretation before resorting to the rule of lenity, and because a court that does so often determines the best reading of the statute, the rule of lenity rarely if ever comes into play. In other words, if lenity invariably comes in `last,' it should essentially come in never. D. Kahan, Lenity and Federal Common Law Crimes, 1994 S. Ct. Rev. 345, 386. As I see it, that explains why this Court rarely relies on the rule of lenity, at least as a decisive factor.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,61,"I would not upset our rule of lenity case law by making the ambiguity trigger any easier to satisfy. For example, I would not say that any front-end ambiguity in the statute justifies resort to the rule of lenity even before exhausting the tools of statutory interpretation. One major problem  with that kind of ambiguity trigger is that ambiguity is in the eye of the beholder and cannot be readily determined on an objective basis. Applying a looser front-end ambiguity trigger would just exacerbate that problem, leading to significant inconsistency, unpredictability, and unfairness in application. See B. KAVANAUGH, Fixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2118, 2136-2139 (2016).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,62,"For those reasons, I would not alter our rule of lenity case law. That said, I very much agree with Justice GORSUCH about the importance of fair notice in federal criminal law. But as I see it, that concern for fair notice is better addressed by other doctrines that protect criminal defendants against arbitrary or vague federal criminal statutes—in particular, the presumption of mens rea.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,63,"The deeply rooted presumption of mens rea generally requires the Government to prove the defendant's mens rea with respect to each element of a federal offense, unless Congress plainly provides otherwise. See Rehaif v. United States, 588 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2191, 2195, 204 L.Ed.2d 594 (2019), see also Flores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U.S. 646, 652, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How To Read Statutes and the Constitution 350-351 (2016), A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 303-312 (2012). In addition, with respect to federal crimes requiring willfulness, the Court generally requires the Government to prove that the defendant was aware that his conduct was unlawful. See Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191-193, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998), Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 201-203, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,64,"To be sure, if a federal criminal statute does not contain a willfulness requirement and if a defendant is prosecuted for violating a legal prohibition or requirement that the defendant honestly was unaware of and reasonably may not have anticipated, unfairness can result because of a lack of fair notice. That scenario could arise with some malum prohibitum federal crimes, for example. But when that fair notice problem arises, one solution where appropriate could be to require proof that the defendant was aware that his conduct was unlawful. Alternatively, another solution could be to allow a mistake-of-law defense in certain circumstances—consistent with the longstanding legal principle that an act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty. See Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250-252, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-001,65,"In sum, I would not invite the inconsistency, unpredictability, and unfairness that would result from expanding the rule of lenity beyond its very limited place in the Court's case law. I would, however, continue to vigorously apply (and where appropriate, extend) mens rea requirements, which as Justice Robert Jackson remarked, are as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.

I agree with the Court's analysis of the ordinary meaning of the word occasion and its conclusion that Wooden's burglaries count only once under the Armed Career Criminal Act. But I do not share the Court's view that Congress ratified the Solicitor General's brief confessing error in United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (CA8  1986), when it amended the Act to add the occasions clause. This argument depends on two flawed inferences: first, that Congress specifically intended to reject the Eighth Circuit's initial decision in Petty, and second, that it embraced the former Solicitor General's reasoning for why that decision was wrong. The latter error, in particular, is likely to work mischief down the line.* * *",Barrett,0,
2021-001,68,"As an initial matter, the Court errs in asserting that the occasions clause was crafted to reject the result that the Eighth Circuit initially reached in Petty. (Recall that the Eighth Circuit changed its view on remand after the Solicitor General confessed error in this Court.) The Court's evidence for that proposition consists of nothing but a short analysis that Senator Byrd submitted for the Congressional Record in calendaring the proposed amendment. Ante, at 1073.",Barrett,0,
2021-001,69,"Petty's tenuous tie to the statute distinguishes this case from the many in which we have recognized that a judicial decision or line of decisions has provided the impetus for legislation. In some instances, enacted findings have explicitly connected the statute to a prior decision. See, e.g., Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 694, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014) (Congress responded to Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb(a)(4), (b)(1) (stating that RFRA was meant to restore the legal framework in place prior to Smith). In others, a well-established legal backdrop has revealed Congress' reasons for acting. See, e.g., Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 436, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (Given the statute's express designation of voluntariness as the touchstone of admissibility, its omission of any warning requirement, and the instruction for trial courts to consider a nonexclusive list of factors relevant to the circumstances of a confession, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress intended by its enactment to overrule Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)). But here, no enacted language mentions Petty, and the Court wisely does not portray the case—a single, subsequently vacated court of appeals opinion— as part of the settled legal landscape against which ACCA was amended. The only thread connecting the occasions clause to Petty is legislative history, and the problems with legislative history are well rehearsed. See, e.g., American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc., 573 U.S. 431, 458, 134 S.Ct. 2498, 189 L.Ed.2d 476 (2014) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing that the Court had treated a few isolated snippets of legislative history as authoritative evidence of congressional intent even though they come from a single report issued by a committee whose members make up a small fraction of one of the two Houses of Congress).",Barrett,0,
2021-001,70,"The Court needs the Petty backstory, though, to make its second, more significant leap: that Congress endorsed the reasoning behind the Solicitor General's confession of error in that case. Ante, at 1073. This move goes bigger than legislative history because it goes beyond the standard error of treating legislators' views about statutory language as authoritative. It presents Senator Byrd's statement as definitive approval of the Solicitor General's position in Petty (an error of the standard variety), and then uses that approval to graft the particulars of the Solicitor General's brief onto the statute (which is really a bridge too far).",Barrett,0,
2021-001,71,"Again, I will not belabor why this approach is flawed. See, e.g., Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 98, 109 S.Ct. 939, 103 L.Ed.2d 67 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (That the Court should refer to the citation of three District Court cases in a document issued by a single committee of a single house as the action of Congress displays the level of unreality that our unrestrained use of legislative history has attained), A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 386 (2012) (Even if the members of each house wish to do so, they cannot assign responsibility for making law—or the details of law—to one of their number, or to one of their committees). But it is worth discussing the Court's jump from legislative history to litigation history because of what it might mean in later cases.",Barrett,0,
2021-001,72,"The Court elevates the Solicitor General's brief to the status of a governing test. Consider how that choice plays out in this case. The Government argues that Wooden's burglaries occurred on separate occasions because they were committed sequentially (unlike Petty's robberies, which the Government says were committed simultaneously). That argument fails for the reasons that the Court explains in Part II-A of its opinion, which I join: Such close-in-time crimes, even if sequential, happen on the same occasion. But rather than resting only on the statutory language, the Court also invokes the reasoning in the Petty brief. It says that the Government cannot be right because",Barrett,0,
2021-001,73,"nothing about the Solicitor General's confession of error, or the action Congress took in its wake, suggests any concern for the exact ordering of Petty's actions. Each was based instead on another idea: A person who has robbed a restaurant, and done nothing else, is not a `habitual offender' or `career criminal.' It was that focus on `revolving door' felons that the Solicitor General referenced in arguing that the courts in Petty had construed ACCA too broadly. Ante, at 1074 (quoting Addendum to Brief for Petitioner 27a and citing 134 Cong. Rec. 13782-13783 (1988)).",Barrett,0,
2021-001,74,"Thus, in the Court's view, the Government's argument fails not only because of the statutory text but also because the Solicitor General's 35-year-old brief, which the statute supposedly incorporates, rules it out. That is not how statutory interpretation is supposed to work.*",Barrett,0,
2021-001,75,"The Court's approach will likely have downstream effects because it invites both litigants and lower courts to mine the Solicitor General's brief for guidance on the scope of the occasions clause—as the parties did in this case. To be sure, the most important indicators of whether crimes occurred on a single occasion—proximity in time and location—will matter most. But on top of that, lower courts may place weight on the buzzwords that the Court highlights in the Solicitor General's brief: repeat offenders, habitual offenders, recidivists, revolving door offenders, and three time losers. Ante, at 1072-1073 (internal quotation marks omitted). And that could sow unnecessary confusion.",Barrett,0,
2021-001,76,"Take a case involving three drug sales that occurred at 8 o'clock on three consecutive evenings at three different locations. Applying the ordinary meaning of the text  seems straightforward enough: The three offenses are separate occasions because they occurred a day apart and at different locations, notwithstanding the similarity of the crimes. Yet factor in the details of the Solicitor General's brief, and the result is not so clear. Is a defendant who committed three crimes over the course of three days really a revolving door offender or a true recidivist? Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Maybe not—those labels evoke a distinct inquiry. And though the labels may capture what Congress was getting at, the statute chooses a particular way of getting there: the text of the occasions clause. We should leave it at that.* * *",Barrett,0,
2021-001,77,"The Court glosses this statute by leaning on weak evidence of Congress' impetus for amending the statute, followed by still weaker evidence that Congress embraced the reasoning of a brief filed by the Solicitor General. I would impute to Congress only what can fairly be imputed to it: the words of the statute. Crimes within a spree like Wooden's do not count as separate ACCA predicates because of the statutory language, not because those who drafted the amendment had either Petty's case or the Solicitor General's prose in mind.",Barrett,0,

2021-001,79,"Once more we confront the Armed Career Criminal Act. Disputes over the statute's meaning have occupied so much of this Court's attention over so many years that various pieces of the law and doctrines associated with it have earned their own nicknames—the Elements Clause, the Residual Clause, the Categorical Approach. Now comes the Occasions Clause. This subsection requires courts to impose 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentences on individuals who unlawfully possess a gun if they also have three or more prior convictions for certain crimes committed on occasions different from one another. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). For years, lower courts have struggled with the Occasions Clause, reaching contradictory judgments on similar facts. We took this case hoping to bring some clarity to at least this particular corner of the ACCA.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,81,"What do we resolve? The Court rejects the Sixth Circuit's rule that crimes occurring sequentially always occur on different occasions. Sometimes, the Court holds, crimes committed one after another can take place on a single occasion. No one doubts that William Wooden had to break through wall after wall dividing 10 separate storage units to complete his crimes. Or that, by the end of it all, he committed 10 distinct criminal offenses. But, the Court explains, none of this automatically dictates the conclusion that his crimes occurred on different occasions. Ante, at 1068-1070.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,82,"Beyond that clear holding, however, lies much uncertainty. Rather than simply observe that sequential crimes can occur on one occasion and return this case to the Court of Appeals for resolution, the Court ventures further. It directs lower courts faced with future Occasions Clause cases to employ a multi-factored balancing test in which a range of circumstances may be relevant. Ante, at 1070-1071.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,83,"The potentially relevant factors turn out to be many and disparate. The Court says that offenses committed close in time often —but not always—take place on a single occasion. Ibid. Offenses separated by substantial gaps in time or significant intervening events usually occur on separate occasions—though what counts as a  substantial gap or significant event remains unexplained. Ibid. Proximity of location can be important too—but it is not necessarily dispositive. Ibid. Whether the defendant's crimes involve similar or intertwined conduct also may—or may not—make a difference. Ibid. And even this long list of factors probably is not exhaustive. Ante, at 1070-1071. Nor does the list come with any instructions on how to weigh the relative importance of so many factors or how to resolve cases when those factors point in different directions.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,84,"The Court's multi-factor balancing test may represent an earnest attempt to bring some shape to future litigation under the Occasions Clause. But it is still very much a judicial gloss on the statute's terms—and one that is unnecessary to resolve the case at hand. Multi-factor balancing tests of this sort, too, have supplied notoriously little guidance in many other contexts, and there is little reason to think one might fare any better here. In fact, many lower courts faced with Occasions Clause cases already look to the same multiplicity of factors the Court prescribes today, including geographic location, the nature of the offenses, the number of victims, the means employed, and time. See, e.g., United States v. Letterlough, 63 F.3d 332, 335-336 (CA4 1995) (listing factors and collecting cases). So far the results have proven anything but predictable given the almost infinite number of factual permutations these cases can present. And all of this has yielded a grave problem: Some individuals face mandatory 15-year prison terms while other similarly situated persons do not— with the results depending on little more than how much weight this or that judge chooses to assign this or that factor.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,85,"Admittedly, a long list of factors may supply a clear answer in some cases. Who doubts that a single gunshot hitting two people involves two crimes on a single occasion—or that two murders separated by years and miles take place on separate occasions? The problem is that beyond easy cases like those lies a universe of hard ones, where a long list of non-exhaustive, only sometimes relevant, and often incommensurable factors promises to perpetuate confusion in the lower courts and conflicting results for those whose liberties hang in the balance.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,86,"Consider some examples. Imagine a defendant who sells drugs to the same undercover police officer twice at the same street corner one hour apart. Do the sales take place on the same occasion or different ones? Remember, proximity of location and similar or intertwined  conduct suggest a single occasion. Ante, at 1071. But substantial gaps in time often indicate two episodes. Ibid. With these factors pointing in different directions and no clear rule for resolving their conflicting guidance, who can be surprised when reasonable minds reach different conclusions?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,87,"Next, take the Court's barroom brawl hypothetical. Because it involves a continuous stream of closely related criminal acts at one location, the Court says the crimes necessarily occur on a single occasion. Ibid. But what if our hypothetical defendant assaults one victim inside the bar and another 20 minutes later in the street outside, in part because the second victim called the police? Are those two assaults part of a continuous stream of conduct? Do they even occur at one location?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,88,"Imagine, too, an individual who commits a robbery or burglary then later assaults a pursuing police officer: Does the later assault happen on a separate occasion from the initial crime? The times, locations, and crimes differ, but they are related in certain respects too. Unsurprisingly, the courts of appeals have disagreed in cases like these. Compare United States v. Leeson,  453 F.3d 631, 639-640 (CA4 2006) (yes), with United States v. Graves, 60 F.3d 1183, 1184-1185, 1187 (CA6 1995) (no).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,89,"Now return to Mr. Wooden. The Court rightly says that crimes taking place sequentially can sometimes happen on a single occasion. Ante, at 1069-1070. But the Court does not stop there and remand this case to the Court of Appeals. After prescribing a long list of factors for use in future cases, it proceeds to declare that every factor points in the same direction in this case and dictates the conclusion that Mr. Wooden's crimes occurred on a single occasion. Ante, at 1071. In particular, the Court stresses that his crimes involved storage units in the same building (location) and took place over the same night (timing). Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,90,"But even when it comes to Mr. Wooden, it's not entirely clear whether the Court's factors compel only one conclusion. When it comes to location, each storage unit had its own number and space, each burglary infringed on a different person's property, and Mr. Wooden had to break through a new wall to enter each one. Suppose this case involved not adjacent storage units but adjacent townhomes or adjacent stores in a mall. If Mr. Wooden had torn through the walls separating them, would we really say his crimes occurred at the same location?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,91,"The answer is no more certain when the question turns to timing. Nothing in the record before us speaks to how long Mr. Wooden lingered over his crimes—whether they spanned one hour or many. Meanwhile, the record does show that between each of his burglaries Mr. Wooden faced a choice between walking away or breaking through another wall into a new storage unit. In this way, each additional obstacle presented a kind of intervening event. As the Sixth Circuit put it, there was no reason why Mr. Wooden could not have called it a night after the first burglary. 945 F.3d 498, 505 (2019). Every judge who confronted this case before us thought his crimes happened on different occasions. And it's not hard to see how different minds might come to different conclusions.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,92,"So what accounts for the Court's disposition in Mr. Wooden's favor? The Court insists that its array of factors point inexorably to the conclusion that his crimes occurred on a single occasion. But when it comes to location, one could view Mr. Wooden's crimes as having taken place in one location or several, and the Court chooses the more lenient option. When it comes to timing, one could view his crimes as transpiring in a single episode or as having many potential breaks in the action, and again the Court chooses the more forgiving course.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,93,"Respectfully, all this suggests to me that the key to this case does not lie as much in a multiplicity of factors as it does in the rule of lenity. Under that rule, any reasonable doubt about the application of a penal law must be resolved in favor of liberty. Because reasonable minds could differ (as they have differed) on the question whether Mr. Wooden's crimes took place on one occasion or many, the rule of lenity demands a judgment in his favor. The rule seems destined as well to play an important role in many other cases under the Occasions Clause—a setting where the statute at issue supplies little guidance, does not define its key term, and the word it does use (occasions) can lead different people to different intuitions about the same set of facts. No list of factors, however thoughtful, can resolve every case under a law like that. Many ambiguous cases are sure to arise. In them, a rule of decision is required—and lenity supplies it.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,95,"The rule of lenity is a new name for an old idea—the notion that penal laws should be construed strictly. The Adventure, 1 F.Cas. 202, 204 (No. 93) (CC Va. 1812) (Marshall, C. J.). The rule first appeared in English courts, justified in part on the assumption that when Parliament intended to inflict severe punishments it would do so clearly. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 88 (1765) (Blackstone), 2 M. Hale, The History of the Pleas of the Crown 335 (1736), see also L. Hall, Strict or Liberal Construction of Penal Statutes, 48 Harv. L. Rev. 748, 749-751 (1935). In the hands of judges in this country, however, lenity came to serve distinctively American functions —a means for upholding the Constitution's commitments to due process and the separation of powers. Accordingly, lenity became a widely recognized rule of statutory construction in the Republic's early years.1",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,96,"Consider lenity's relationship to due process. Under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, neither the federal government nor the States may deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. U.S. Const., Amdts. 5, 14. Generally, that guarantee requires governments seeking to take a person's freedom or possessions to adhere to those settled usages and modes of proceeding found in the common law. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 277, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1856), N. Chapman & M. McConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1774-1775 (2012). And among those settled usages is the ancient rule that the law must afford ordinary people fair notice of its demands. See, e.g., Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.S. ___, ___-___, 138 S.Ct. 1204, 1224-1225, 200 L.Ed.2d 549 (2018) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Lenity works to enforce the fair notice requirement by ensuring that an individual's liberty always prevails over ambiguous laws.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,97,"Early cases confirm the message. In United States v. Wiltberger, a sailor had killed an individual on a river in China. 5 Wheat. 76, 77, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820). But the federal statute under which he was charged criminalized manslaughter only on the `high seas.' Id., at 93 (quoting Act of Apr. 30, 1790, § 12, 1 Stat. 115). Chief Justice Marshall acknowledged that other parts of the law might have suggested Congress intended to capture the sailor's conduct. 5 Wheat. at 105. But he insisted that penal laws are to be construed strictly because of the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals—and, more specifically, the right of every person to suffer only those punishments dictated by the plain meaning of words. Id., at 95-96. Where the text of a law mandates punishment for the defendant's conduct in terms an ordinary person can understand, a court's job is to apply it as written. Id., at 95. But where uncertainty exists, the law gives way to liberty.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,98,"United States v. Mann tells a similar story. 26 F. Cas. 1153 (No. 15,718) (CC NH 1812). There, Justice Story faced the question whether a federal statute authorized  punishment against a shipowner. After concluding the statutory text did not supply a definite answer, Justice Story explained that it is a principle grown hoary in age and wisdom, that penal statutes are to be construed strictly. Id., at 1157. And that principle more or less resolved the case. I will not be the first judge, Justice Story wrote, to strain a proviso against a citizen, beyond the fair import of its expressions. Ibid. Here again, the connection between lenity and fair notice was clear: If the law inflicting punishment does not speak plainly to the defendant's conduct, liberty must prevail. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,99,"Of course, most ordinary people today don't spend their leisure time reading statutes —and they probably didn't in Justice Marshall's and Justice Story's time either. But lenity's emphasis on fair notice isn't about indulging a fantasy. It is about protecting an indispensable part of the rule of law—the promise that, whether or not individuals happen to read the law, they can suffer penalties only for violating standing rules announced in advance. As the framers understood, subjecting  men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law  has been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instrument of tyranny. The Federalist No. 84, pp. 511-512 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton), see also McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law  fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,100,"Closely related to its fair notice function is lenity's role in vindicating the separation of powers. Under our Constitution, all of the federal government's legislative Powers are vested in Congress. Art. I, § 1. Perhaps the most important consequence of this assignment concerns the power to punish. Any new national laws restricting liberty require the assent of the people's representatives and thus input from the country's many parts, interests and classes. The Federalist No. 51, at 324 (J. Madison). Lenity helps safeguard this design by preventing judges from intentionally or inadvertently exploiting doubtful statutory expressions to enforce their own sensibilities. Mann, 26 F. Cas., at 1157. It places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly, forcing the government to seek any clarifying changes to the law rather than impose the costs of ambiguity on presumptively free persons. United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 514, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) (plurality opinion). In this way, the rule helps keep the power of punishment firmly in the legislative, not in the judicial department. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. at 95.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,101,"Doubtless, lenity carries its costs. If judges cannot enlarge ambiguous penal laws to cover problems Congress failed to anticipate in clear terms, some cases will fall through the gaps and the legislature's cumbersome processes will have to be reengaged. But, as the framers appreciated, any other course risks rendering a self-governing people slaves to their magistrates, with their liberties dependent on the private opinions of the judge. 4 Blackstone 371 (1769). From the start, lenity has played an important role in realizing a distinctly American version of the rule of law—one that seeks to ensure people are never punished for violating just-so rules concocted after the fact, or rules with no more claim to democratic provenance than a judge's surmise about legislative intentions.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,103,It may be understandable why the Court declines to discuss lenity today. Certain controversies and misunderstandings  about the rule have crept into our law in recent years. I would take this opportunity to answer them.,Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,104,"Begin with the most basic of these controversies —the degree of ambiguity required to trigger the rule of lenity. Some have suggested that courts should consult the rule of lenity only when, after employing every tool of interpretation, a court confronts a grievous statutory ambiguity. See, e.g., Shaw v. United States, 580 U.S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 462, 469, 196 L.Ed.2d 373 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). But ask yourself: If the sheriff cited a loosely written statute as authority to seize your home, would you be satisfied with a judicial explanation that, yes, the law was ambiguous, but the sheriff wins anyway because the ambiguity isn't grievous? If a judge sentenced you to decades in prison for conduct that no law clearly proscribed, would it matter to you that the judge considered the law merely —not grievously—ambiguous?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,105,"This grievous business does not derive from any well-considered theory about lenity or the mainstream of this Court's opinions. Since the founding, lenity has sought to ensure that the government may not inflict punishments on individuals without fair notice and the assent of the people's representatives. See supra, at 1081-1084. A rule that allowed judges to send people to prison based on intuitions about merely ambiguous laws would hardly serve those ends. Tellingly, this Court's early cases did not require a grievous ambiguity before applying the rule of lenity. Instead, they followed other courts in holding that, in the construction of a penal statute, it is well settled  that all reasonable doubts concerning its meaning ought to operate in favor of the defendant. Harrison v. Vose, 9 How. 372, 378, 13 L.Ed. 179 (1850) (emphasis added).2 Nineteenth century treatises seeking to record the rule put the point this way: If there is such an ambiguity in a penal statute as to leave reasonable doubts of its meaning, it is the duty of a court not to inflict the penalty. J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 353, p. 444 (1891), see also 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Criminal Law § 133, p. 172 (2d ed. 1858) (Bishop). Many of this Court's contemporary cases employ the same standard too, if sometimes in slightly different words.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,106,"So where did the talk about grievous ambiguities begin? The problem may trace  to Huddleston v. United States, 415 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974). That decision came during a bygone era characterized by a more freewheeling approach to statutory construction. Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2356, 2364, 204 L.Ed.2d 742 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor did the decision pause to consider, let alone overrule, any of this Court's preexisting cases explaining lenity's original and historic scope. Indeed, in the years that followed Huddleston, this Court routinely returned to a more traditional understanding. See n. 3, supra. And even in Huddleston itself, the discussion of grievous ambiguities was dicta—the Court found no ambiguity of any kind in the statute at issue. See 415 U.S. at 831-832, 94 S.Ct. 1262. These peculiar circumstances hardly supply any court with a sound basis for ignoring or restricting one of the most ancient rules of statutory construction —let alone one so closely connected to the Constitution's protections.4",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,107,"A second and related misunderstanding has crept into our law. Sometimes, Members of this Court have suggested that we possess the authority to punish individuals under ambiguous laws in light of our own perceptions about some piece of legislative history or the statute's purpose. See, e.g., Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 109-111, 111 S.Ct. 461, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990), United States v. R. L. C., 503 U.S. 291, 305, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992) (plurality opinion). Today's decision seemingly nods in the same direction. In a sentence in Part II-A, the Court says that statutory purpose is one factor a judge may keep an eye on when deciding whether to enhance an individual's sentence under the Occasions Clause. Ante, at 1070-1071. The Court then proceeds to discuss the Clause's legislative history at length in Part II-B. It may be that the Court today intends to suggest only that judges may consult legislative history and purpose to limit, never expand, punishment under an ambiguous statute. But even if that's so, why take such a long way around to the place where lenity already stands waiting?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,108,"The right path is the more straightforward one. Where the traditional tools of  statutory interpretation yield no clear answer, the judge's next step isn't to legislative history or the law's unexpressed purposes. The next step is to lenity. As Justice Story explained, because penal statutes are construed strictly  forfeitures are not to be inflicted by straining the words so as to reach some conjectural policy. United States v. Open Boat, 27 F.Cas. 354, 357 (No. 15,968) (CC Me. 1829). If cases are not provided for in the text of the act, courts of justice do not adventure on the usurpation of legislative authority. Ibid. Or as Chief Justice Marshall put it, to determine that a case is within the intention of a statute, its language must authorise us to say so. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. at 96. Any other approach would be unsafe and dangerous—risking the possibility that judges rather than legislators will control the power to define crimes and their punishments. Ibid., see also Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 422, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990) (Longstanding principles of lenity  preclude our resolution of the ambiguity on the basis of general declarations of policy in the statute and legislative history), R. L. C., 503 U.S. at 307-311, 112 S.Ct. 1329 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,109,"At least one more misconception has arisen in recent years. In debating the merits of the rule of lenity, some have treated the rule as an island unto itself—a curiosity",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,110,"unique to criminal cases. But in truth, lenity has long applied outside what we today might call the criminal law.5 And it is just one of a number of judicial doctrines that seek to protect fair notice and the separation of powers. Vagueness doctrine and others besides spring from similar aspirations. From time to time and for historically contingent reasons, one or another of these doctrines has come into or gone out of fashion. But narrow one avenue and the same underlying rule-of-law imperatives will eventually find another way to express themselves. None of these doctrines should be artificially divorced from the others, all are worthy of our respect.6",Gorsuch,0,
2021-001,112,"The rule of lenity has a critical role to play in cases under  the Occasions Clause. The statute contains little guidance, and reasonable doubts about its application will arise often. When they do, they should be resolved in favor of liberty. Today, the Court does not consult lenity's rule, but neither does it forbid lower courts from doing so in doubtful cases. That course is the sound course. Under our rule of law, punishments should never be products of judicial conjecture about this factor or that one. They should come only with the assent of the people's elected representatives and in laws clear enough to supply fair warning  to the world. McBoyle, 283 U.S. at 27, 51 S.Ct. 340.7",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,31,"After a state court determines that an error at trial did not prejudice a criminal defendant, may a federal court grant habeas relief based solely on its independent assessment of the error's prejudicial effect under Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)? Or must a federal court also evaluate the state court's decision under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)? The Sixth Circuit ruled that an individual who satisfies Brecht alone is entitled to habeas relief. This was mistaken. When a state court has ruled on the merits of a state prisoner's claim, a federal court cannot grant relief without first applying both the test this Court outlined in Brecht and the one Congress prescribed in AEDPA.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,34,"One evening in 2007, Annette White attended a gathering with Ervine Davenport. On the drive home, Mr. Davenport killed Ms. White. At trial, the only questions concerned why and how. Mr. Davenport claimed self-defense and testified to that effect. On his account, Ms. White grew angry during the trip and tried to grab the steering wheel from him while he was driving. Then she pulled out a box cutter and cut his arm. Mr. Davenport responded by extending one arm and pinning Ms. White against the passenger side of the car, with his hand under her chin. Eventually, she stopped struggling. On discovering that Ms. White was no longer breathing, Mr. Davenport panicked and left her body in a field.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,35,"The prosecution offered a very different version of events. It stressed that Ms. White was 5'2 tall, 103 pounds, and had a broken wrist, while Mr. Davenport was 6'5 tall and weighed nearly 300 pounds. The prosecution presented evidence that Mr. Davenport had bragged to others before the killing that, if he had a problem with someone, he would choke the person. Days before Ms. White's death, Mr. Davenport had done just that—strangling another woman until she lost consciousness and urinated on herself. Nor, on the prosecution's account, were Mr. Davenport's actions after Ms. White's death consistent with his claim of self-defense. Instead of contacting the police, he not only abandoned his victim's body. He also fled the scene and later visited Ms. White's home where he stole electronics and food. He told a witness, too, that he had to off Ms. White.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,36,"The prosecution offered additional proof. When police questioned Mr. Davenport, he gave differing accounts and initially denied any involvement in Ms. White's death. While authorities did locate a box cutter in the car, they did not find it inside the cab of the vehicle but in the trunk and untainted by blood. Also, a forensic pathologist testified that Ms. White died of manual strangulation. The pathologist explained that a victim of strangulation may lose consciousness after 30 seconds, but that  death does not occur until the victim is without air for at least four to five minutes. After Mr. Davenport testified that he merely extended his arm across Ms. White's neck to keep her from cutting him, the forensic pathologist offered his view that this account was not plausible. Ms. White's injuries, found on both sides of her neck, were consistent with strangulation— but inconsistent with the application of broad force across the front of her neck.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,37,"After a 7-day trial, a jury convicted Mr. Davenport of first-degree murder.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,39,"On direct appeal in state court, Mr. Davenport sought to have his conviction set aside in light of Deck v. Missouri, 544 U.S. 622, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005). In Deck, this Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause generally forbids shackling a criminal defendant at trial absent a special need. Id., at 626, 125 S.Ct. 2007. Mr. Davenport noted that during his trial (but not his testimony) officials shackled one of his hands, his waist, and his ankles. Those shackles may not have been visible to many in the courtroom because of a privacy screen around the table where Mr. Davenport sat. But the trial court did not articulate on the record any special need for its security measures.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,40,"Ultimately, the Michigan Supreme Court agreed that the trial court's actions violated Deck. At the same time, the court sought to apply Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). In Chapman, this Court held that a preserved claim of constitutional error identified on direct appeal does not require reversal of a conviction if the prosecution can establish that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824. To answer Chapman's question, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to determine whether the jury saw the defendant's shackles and, if so, whether the prosecution can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the shackling error did not contribute to the verdict against the defendant. People v. Davenport, 488 Mich. 1054, 794 N.W.2d 616 (2011).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,41,"On remand, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing in which it heard from all 12 jurors. Five remembered seeing Mr. Davenport's restraints, the remaining seven did not. All 12 testified that Mr. Davenport's shackles did not enter into their deliberations or influence their unanimous verdict. Based on this evidence, the trial court found that the State had carried its burden to show harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,42,"Again, Mr. Davenport appealed. This time, Michigan's appellate courts declined to disturb the judgment. For its part, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the shackling error did not affect the verdict. People v. Davenport, 2012 WL 6217134, *3 (Dec. 13, 2012) (per curiam). In doing so, the court relied on both the jurors' testimony and that the evidence at trial overwhelmingly established defendant's guilt and belied his contention that he killed the 103-pound victim in self-defense, a theory that was explicitly disputed by expert medical testimony. Id., at *2, n. 2. The Michigan Supreme Court denied Mr. Davenport's request for discretionary review. People v. Davenport, 494 Mich. 875, 832 N.W.2d 389, 390 (2013).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,44,"Mr. Davenport next sought relief in federal district court, filing a habeas petition in the Western District of Michigan. Under AEDPA, however, a federal court may disturb a final state-court conviction in only narrow circumstances. As relevant  here, the statute provides that, when a state court has already ruled on the merits of the habeas petitioner's claim, he must show that decision was either (1) contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by the decisions of this Court, or (2) based on an unreasonable determination of the facts presented in the state-court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,45,"The District Court found relief unwarranted under this standard. The Michigan state courts had ruled on the merits of Mr. Davenport's claim of error. In doing so, they correctly identified this Court's controlling harmless-error rule from Chapman. And their conclusions involved neither an unreasonable application of Chapman nor an unreasonable determination of the facts. To the contrary, the District Court agreed with a Magistrate Judge's assessment that the state-court record contained no evidence that the jurors were influenced by his restraints and overwhelming evidence of Mr. Davenport's guilt. Davenport v. MacLaren, 2016 WL 11262506, *4 (WD Mich., Nov. 7, 2016), see also Davenport v. MacLaren, 2017 WL 4296808, *1-*2 (WD Mich., Sept. 26, 2017) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,47,"After that loss, Mr. Davenport appealed to the Sixth Circuit, where a divided panel reversed. Davenport v. MacLaren, 964 F.3d 448 (2020).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,48,"Unlike the District Court, the Sixth Circuit declined to analyze the case under AEDPA. Instead, it held, only this Court's decision in Brecht v. Abrahamson governed its review. Handed down before Congress adopted AEDPA, Brecht sought to adapt Chapman's harmless-error rule, developed for cases on direct appellate review, for use in federal habeas proceedings. Brecht, 507 U.S., at 633-635, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Citing the need to afford appropriate respect to final state-court decisions that have already endured direct appeal, including potential review in this Court, Brecht effectively inverted Chapman's burden. 507 U.S., at 635, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Rather than require the prosecution to prove that a constitutional trial error is harmless, Brecht held that a state prisoner seeking to challenge his conviction in collateral federal proceedings must show that the error had a `substantial and injurious effect or influence' on the outcome of his trial. Id., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Persuaded that Mr. Davenport could satisfy his burden under Brecht, the panel majority ordered Michigan to retry or release him promptly. 964 F.3d, at 464-468.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,49,"Judge Readler dissented. He argued that Brecht and AEDPA set forth independent tests, and that both must be satisfied before habeas relief becomes permissible. In Judge Readler's view, too, the District Court correctly rejected Mr. Davenport's petition under AEDPA because the state courts hearing his case had not acted contrary to, or unreasonably applied, this Court's decisions. 964 F.3d, at 469, 478.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,50,"The Sixth Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a vote of 8 to 7. Davenport v. MacLaren, 975 F.3d 537 (2020). Judges Griffin and Thapar issued dissenting opinions.

We granted Michigan's petition for certiorari to resolve the conflict in the federal courts of appeals about the proper interaction between these two tests. Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U. S.",Gorsuch,0,

2021-003,53,"When Congress supplies a constitutionally valid rule of decision, federal courts must follow it. In AEDPA, Congress announced such a rule. It instructed that a federal court shall not  grant relief with respect to a claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court's decision was (1) contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by the decisions of this Court, or (2) based on an unreasonable determination of the facts presented in the state-court proceeding. § 2254(d) (emphasis added).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,54,"The upshot of these directions for our case is straightforward. No one questions that a state court's harmless-error determination qualifies as an adjudication on the merits under AEDPA. See Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 269, 135 S.Ct. 2187, 192 L.Ed.2d 323 (2015), Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 119, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007), Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 10-11, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) (per curiam). No one disputes that such a decision exists here. Nor does Mr. Davenport pursue any claim to relief under § 2254(d)(2). From this, it follows that he must satisfy § 2254(d)(1) to secure federal habeas relief. To be sure, where Brecht is implicated a federal court must also ensure a habeas petitioner has carried his burden under its terms before granting relief. But in cases like ours satisfying Brecht is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition to relief. AEDPA too must be satisfied. The Sixth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,56,"Some background helps explain this arrangement. From the founding, Congress authorized federal courts to issue habeas writs to federal custodians. § 14, 1 Stat. 81-82. After the Civil War, Congress extended this authority, allowing federal courts to issue habeas writs to state custodians as well. See Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, § 1, 14 Stat. 385. But these statutes used permissive rather than mandatory language, federal courts had the power to grant writs of habeas corpus in certain circumstances. That same structure lives on in contemporary statutes, which provide that federal courts may grant habeas relief as law and justice require. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241, 2243, Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 285, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992) (plurality opinion).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,57,"Over the centuries, a number of writs of habeas corpus evolved at common law to serve a number of different functions. See Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 97-98, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807), 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 129-131 (1768). But the most notable among these writs was that of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, often called the Great Writ. Id., at 131. When English monarchs jailed their subjects summarily and indefinitely, common-law courts employed the writ as a way to compel the crown to explain its actions—and, if necessary, ensure adequate process, such as a trial, before allowing any further detention. See Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1, ch.1, ¶¶ 5, 8 (1628). The Great Writ was, in this way, no less than the instrument by which due process could be insisted upon. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 555, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,58,"At the same time, even this writ had its limits. Usually, a prisoner could not use it to challenge a final judgment of conviction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. See, e.g., Opinion on the Writ of Habeas Corpus, Wilm. 77, 88, 97 Eng. Rep. 29, 36  (K. B. 1758). If the point of the writ was to ensure due process attended an individual's confinement, a trial was generally considered proof he had received just that. See, e.g., Bushell's Case, Vaugh. 135, 142-143, 124 Eng. Rep. 1006, 1009-1010 (C. P. 1670).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,59,"This traditional understanding extended from England to this country and persisted through much of our history. Asked to apply the Nation's first habeas statute to a duly convicted prisoner, Chief Justice Marshall invoked the common-law rule that a judgment of conviction after trial was conclusive on all the world. Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 202-203, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830). Acknowledging that Congress had authorized the Court to inquire into the sufficiency of the cause of the petitioner's detention, Marshall asked rhetorically, is not that judgment in itself sufficient cause? Id., at 202 (emphasis added), see also Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S. 18, 21-22, 23 L.Ed. 787 (1876), P. Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 465-469 (1963) (Bator).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,60,"If the answer was nearly always yes, an important exception existed in both English and American law: A habeas court could grant relief if the court of conviction lacked jurisdiction over the defendant or his offense. See Watkins, 3 Pet., at 202-203, Bator 471-472. A perceived error in the judgment or proceedings, under and by virtue of which the party is imprisoned, constituted no ground for relief. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 375, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880). Instead, a habeas court could examine only the power and authority of the court to act, not the correctness of its conclusions. Harlan v. McGourin, 218 U.S. 442, 448, 31 S.Ct. 44, 54 L.Ed. 1101 (1910). To be sure, the line between mere errors and jurisdictional defects was not always a luminous beacon and it evolved over time. Bator 470, Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1547, 209 L.Ed.2d 651 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (Op., at 1568). But this Court generally sought to police the doctrine's boundaries in cases involving federal and state prisoners alike.1",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,61,"By 1953, however, federal habeas practice began to take on a very different  shape. That year in Brown v. Allen this Court held that a state-court judgment is not res judicata in federal habeas proceedings with respect to a petitioner's federal constitutional claims. 344 U. S. 443, 458, 73 S.Ct. 397 (1953). A state court may reject the petitioner's claims after a fair hearing. No appellate court, including this one, may see fit to reverse that final judgment. Yet still, Brown suggested, a federal district court approaching the same case years later should be free to decide de novo whether the state-court proceedings resulted in a satisfactory conclusion and to issue habeas relief if that conclusion is found wanting. Id., at 463, 73 S.Ct. 397, see also Wright, 505 U.S., at 287-288, 112 S.Ct. 2482 (plurality opinion). The traditional distinction between jurisdictional defects and mere errors in adjudication no longer restrained federal habeas courts. Full-blown constitutional error correction became the order of the day.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,62,"This shift did not go unnoticed. Concurring only in the result, Justice Jackson contended that the Court's decision trivialized the writ and was inconsistent with the presumption of finality that traditionally attached to criminal convictions. Brown, 344 U.S., at 536, 543, 73 S.Ct. 397. He warned, too, that the Court's ruling threatened haystacks of new habeas petitions—and that federal courts would struggle to identify the meritorious needles among them. Id., at 537, 73 S.Ct. 397. Over the ensuing years, that prediction proved prescient: Federal courts struggled with an exploding caseload of habeas petitions from state prisoners. See, e.g., Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 274, n. 37, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring) (In 1971  state prisoners alone filed 7,949 petitions for habeas in federal district courts, over 14 times the number filed when Mr. Justice Jackson voiced his misgivings), B. Garrett & L. Kovarsky, Federal Habeas Corpus 135-136 (2013) (documenting the rise of habeas filings by state prisoners).2  B",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,63,"Eventually, this Court responded to the post-Brown habeas boom by devising new rules aimed at separating the meritorious needles from the growing haystack. The habeas statutes themselves provided the starting place for these efforts. Recall that Congress invested federal courts with discretion when it comes to supplying habeas relief—providing that they may (not must) grant writs of habeas corpus, and that they should do so only as law and justice require. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241, 2243. This language, the Court recognized, serves as authorization to adjust the scope of the writ in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations. Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 U.S. 264, 278, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008), see also Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 716, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Foremost among those considerations is the States' powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty. Calderon v.

2021-003,65,"Brecht was part of this effort. In Chapman, this Court held that, when a defendant demonstrates on direct appeal that a constitutional error occurred at his trial, his conviction cannot stand unless the government proves the error's harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. 386 U.S., at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824. In Brecht, the Court resolved that this same standard was inappropriate for use in federal habeas review of final state-court judgments. 507 U.S., at 633-634, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Instead, the Court reasoned, a state prisoner should not receive federal habeas relief based on trial error unless he can show the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the verdict. Id., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching its judgment, the Court stressed that undoing a final state-court judgment  is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for only `extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice system' and different in kind from providing relief on direct appeal. Id., at 633-634, 113 S.Ct. 1710. To allow a federal habeas court to set aside a conviction based on nothing more than speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error would be to give short shrift to the State's sovereign interest in its final judgment. Calderon v. Coleman, 525 U.S. 141, 146, 119 S.Ct. 500, 142 L.Ed.2d 521 (1998) (per curiam). Much as the Court had filled the gaps of the habeas statute with respect to other matters, it found it necessary to do so again, in a by-now familiar exercise of its equitable discretion.

2021-003,67,"Three years after Brecht, and apparently finding the Court's equitable doctrines insufficient, Congress introduced its own reforms in AEDPA.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,68,"In many ways, the statute represented a sea change in federal habeas law. As we have seen, Congress instructed that, if a state court has adjudicated the petitioner's claim on the merits, a federal court shall not grant habeas relief unless certain conditions are satisfied. § 2254(d). Some of these conditions were new to the law at the time of their adoption, all are demanding. See Richter, 562 U.S., at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,69,"Still, Congress did not wash away everything that came before. While AEDPA announced certain new conditions to relief, it did not guarantee relief upon their satisfaction. Instead, Congress left intact the equitable discretion traditionally invested in federal courts by preexisting habeas statutes. So even a petitioner who prevails under AEDPA must still today persuade a federal habeas court that law and justice require relief. § 2243. See Fry, 551 U.S., at 119, 127 S.Ct. 2321, Horn v. Banks, 536 U.S. 266, 272, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) (per curiam).

2021-003,70,"Today, then, a federal court must deny relief to a state habeas petitioner who fails to satisfy either this Court's equitable precedents or AEDPA. But to grant relief, a court must find that the petitioner has cleared both tests. The Sixth Circuit erred when it held Mr. Davenport to just one of these burdens. It granted relief after finding for him on Brecht. But it failed to ask the further question whether he satisfied AEDPA. In doing so, the court disregarded Congress's instruction that habeas relief shall not be granted unless AEDPA's terms are satisfied. § 2254(d).",Gorsuch,0,

2021-003,74,"Mr. Davenport first suggests the Sixth Circuit's failure to discuss AEDPA amounted to no more than a forgivable peccadillo. On his account, the AEDPA inquiry represents a logical subset of the Brecht test. So even though the Sixth Circuit did not formally find that he satisfied AEDPA, it implicitly did so when it found his case cleared Brecht.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,75,"This theory is mistaken. Proof of prejudice under Brecht does not equate to a successful showing under AEDPA. Instead, the inquiries are entirely different in kind. J. Greabe, The Riddle of Harmless Error Revisited, 54 Houston L. Rev. 59, 113, n. 297 (2016) (emphasis deleted). They pose courts with different questions to resolve and require courts to answer those questions based on different legal materials.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,76,"Take the questions the two tests pose. When a state court has applied Chapman, § 2254(d)(1) requires a habeas petitioner to prove that the state court's decision was unreasonable. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011), Fry, 551 U.S., at 119, 127 S.Ct. 2321. To accomplish that, a petitioner must persuade a federal court that no fairminded jurist could reach the state court's conclusion under this Court's precedents. Ayala, 576 U.S., at 269, 135 S.Ct. 2187 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, if a petitioner alleges the state court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts under § 2254(d)(2), it is not enough to show that reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the finding in question. Brumfield v. Cain, 576 U.S. 305, 314, 135 S.Ct. 2269, 192 L.Ed.2d 356 (2015) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). By contrast, under Brecht a petitioner may prevail by persuading a federal court that it alone should harbor grave doubt—not absolute certainty—about whether the trial error affected the verdict's outcome. O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 435, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). In sum, where AEDPA asks whether every fairminded jurist would agree that an error was prejudicial, Brecht asks only whether a federal habeas court itself harbors grave doubt about the petitioner's verdict.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,77,"Next, consider the legal materials a court may consult when applying the two tests. Section 2254(d)(1) limits habeas relief to cases where a state-court decision contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is not enough that the state-court decision offends lower federal court precedents. See, e.g., Glebe v. Frost, 574 U.S. 21, 24, 135 S.Ct. 429, 190 L.Ed.2d 317 (2014) (per curiam). This Court's dicta cannot supply a ground for relief. See, e.g., White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. 415, 419, 134 S.Ct. 1697, 188 L.Ed.2d 698 (2014). Nor can holdings that speak only at a high level of generality. See, e.g., Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.S. 1, 6, 135 S.Ct. 1, 190 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014) (per curiam), Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). Under AEDPA too, state-court decisions are measured against this Court's precedents as of `the time the state court renders its decision' and cannot be held unreasonable only in light of later decided cases. Pinholster, 563 U.S., at 182, 131 S.Ct. 1388 (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003)). None of these restrictions applies under Brecht. There, a federal habeas court may consult and draw on the whole body of law. So, for example, a petitioner might be able to prevail under Brecht thanks to favorable circuit case law but still lose under AEDPA because no comparable holding exists in this Court's precedents.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,78,"Today's case illustrates how these differences matter. The Sixth Circuit granted relief to Mr. Davenport after concluding that it harbored grave doubts about the jury's verdict. It did not claim that every reasonable jurist would share its doubts. Nor did it purport to hold that the Michigan  state courts had acted contrary to or unreasonably applied a decision of this Court. Instead, the Sixth Circuit said only that the state-court decisions in this case could not be reconciled with a roughly analogous precedent from the Ninth Circuit. 964 F.3d, at 467. Even assuming the Sixth Circuit's analysis was enough to permit relief under Brecht, none of its reasoning was enough to warrant relief under AEDPA. Nor can any of this come as a surprise. As we have seen, if AEDPA makes winning habeas relief more difficult, it is because Congress adopted the law to do just that.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,80,"Failing in his first argument, Mr. Davenport offers an alternative. Even if all we have said is true as a matter of logic, he suggests, we should rule for him anyway as a matter of precedent thanks to Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007), and Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 135 S.Ct. 2187, 192 L.Ed.2d 323 (2015).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,81,"Here, too, we cannot agree. Start with Fry. Because no state court had ruled on the merits of the petitioner's Chapman claim, everyone in Fry agreed that AEDPA did not apply to his federal habeas petition. Seeking to leverage that fact to his further advantage, the petitioner argued that Congress implicitly swept away this Court's equitable habeas precedents when it adopted AEDPA. 551 U.S., at 119, 127 S.Ct. 2321. The upshot? On the petitioner's view, this meant a federal habeas court had to apply Chapman (not Brecht or AEDPA) to his case. Ultimately, the Court rejected this argument, confirming instead that our equitable precedents remain applicable whether or not AEDPA applies. 551 U.S., at 121, 127 S.Ct. 2321.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,82,"None of this answers the question we face today. Where the petitioner in Fry sought to suggest that AEDPA rendered Brecht a dead letter, the petitioner here argues nearly the opposite. And the Court's ruling in Fry is, if anything, affirmatively unhelpful to Mr. Davenport. Not only did Fry hold that this Court's equitable precedents like Brecht coexist side-by-side with AEDPA, it expressly recognized that AEDPA sets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief  not an entitlement to it. 551 U.S., at 119-120, 127 S.Ct. 2321. Rather than suggest Brecht duplicates AEDPA or vice versa, Fry thus stands as a reminder that the two tests impose analytically distinct preconditions to relief.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,83,"Mr. Davenport offers no persuasive reply. Instead, he invites us to overlook all of this and train our attention to a brief  passage at the end of Fry's relevant analysis. There, he notes, the Court said this: It certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests (AEDPA/Chapman and Brecht) when the latter obviously subsumes the former. 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321. On Mr. Davenport's telling, whatever else Fry did or said, this language means it adopted his theory that a court applying Brecht necessarily applies AEDPA along the way.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,84,"We do not see how we might read so much into so little. Doubtless, there are some cases when Brecht does subsume AEDPA, just as Fry says. 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321. As we have seen, and as was the case in Fry, if a state court has not adjudicated the petitioner's claim on the merits, AEDPA falls away. Likewise, if a federal court determines that a habeas petition fails because of Brecht, there is no need to prolong the matter by formally applying AEDPA as well. 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321. But none of this means, and Fry never said, that a Brecht inquiry always subsumes an AEDPA inquiry. Nor did Fry even have reason to consider the relationship between Brecht and AEDPA in cases like ours—where a state court has issued a decision on the merits of the petitioner's claim and AEDPA does apply. To the extent Fry had anything to say about that scenario, all it said was consistent with what we say today: In such cases, the Court recognized, relief may not be granted unless the state court's adjudication was unreasonable under AEDPA. 551 U.S., at 119, 127 S.Ct. 2321.4",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,85,"That leaves Davis v. Ayala, where a similar story unfolds. There, the California Supreme Court did rule on the merits of the petitioner's claim: It determined that any federal constitutional errors in his trial-court proceedings were harmless under Chapman. Ayala, 576 U.S., at 263-264, 135 S.Ct. 2187. In later federal habeas proceedings, the Ninth Circuit applied Brecht, found prejudice, and granted relief without pausing to consider AEDPA directly. Ayala v. Wong, 756 F.3d 656, 674 (CA9 2014). Instead, it asserted, much as Mr. Davenport does, that a favorable finding for a petitioner under Brecht necessarily answers AEDPA's distinct inquiry. 756 F.3d, at 674, n. 13. In the end, however, this Court reversed. We held that the Ninth Circuit misapplied Brecht and that a proper Brecht analysis precluded relief. Along the way, we indicated that the petitioner could not prove eligibility for relief under AEDPA's demanding standard either.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,86,"With nothing in this holding to help him, Mr. Davenport again asks us to focus on a carefully curated snippet. Borrowing language from Fry, Ayala observed that a prisoner who seeks federal habeas corpus relief must satisfy Brecht, and if the state court adjudicated his claim on the merits, the Brecht test subsumes the limitations imposed by AEDPA. Ayala, 576 U.S., at 270, 135 S.Ct. 2187 (citing Fry, 551 U.S., at  119-120, 127 S.Ct. 2321). Again, though, it is hard to see how this much might carry the day. When a federal court determines, as we did in Ayala, that a petitioner has failed to carry his burden under Brecht, that conclusion subsumes (or perhaps more precisely, obviates the need for) a separate AEDPA inquiry, relief must be denied. But none of this resolves the distinct question we face today—whether a petitioner who can satisfy Brecht also necessarily secures a victory under AEDPA. The Ayala Court had no occasion to address that question. And to the extent it spoke to it, it spoke much as Fry had, taking pains to reject any suggestion that Brecht somehow abrogates the limitation on federal habeas relief that § 2254(d) plainly sets out. Ayala, 576 U.S., at 268, 135 S.Ct. 2187.5",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,87,"In the end, Mr. Davenport's appeals to Fry and Ayala (echoed by the dissent) rest on a misunderstanding of stare decisis. At its best, that doctrine is a call for judicial humility. It is a reminder to afford careful consideration to the work of our forbearers, their experience, and their wisdom. But respect for past judgments also means respecting their limits. This Court has long stressed that the language of an opinion is not always to be parsed as though we were dealing with the language of a statute. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 341, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979). Yet that is exactly what Mr. Davenport and the dissent ask of us. They would have us override a lawful congressional command—that no federal habeas relief should issue unless AEDPA's applicable conditions are satisfied. § 2254(d). And they would have us do so on the basis of a handful of sentences extracted from decisions that had no reason to pass on the argument Mr. Davenport presents today. We neither expect nor hope that our successors will comb these pages for stray comments and stretch them beyond their context—all to justify an outcome inconsistent with this Court's reasoning and judgments and with Congress's instructions. Such an exalted view of this Court's every passing remark would turn stare decisis from a tool of judicial humility into one of judicial hubris.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,89,"Having concluded that the Sixth Circuit erred by failing to apply AEDPA before granting habeas relief, one question remains: Assuming Mr. Davenport can satisfy Brecht as the Sixth Circuit held, can he satisfy AEDPA? The answer helps illustrate how the two inquiries are distinct and why a federal court must answer both before overturning a state-court conviction.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,90,"Under the statute's terms, we assess the reasonableness of the last state-court adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claim. Greene v. Fisher, 565 U.S. 34, 40, 132 S.Ct. 38, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011). In this case, that is the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals. To be sure, after that intermediate court ruled against Mr. Davenport he sought discretionary review in the Michigan Supreme Court, which denied his request. See 494  Mich., at 875, 832 N.W.2d, at 390. But a discretionary denial of leave to appeal does not typically entail an adjudication of the underlying claim's merits under AEDPA's terms. Instead, it usually represents a decision by the state supreme court not to hear the appeal—that is, not to decide at all. Greene, 565 U.S., at 40, 132 S.Ct. 38, cf. Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 805-806, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991) (The discretionary denial of review on direct appeal by the California Supreme Court is not even a `judgment').",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,91,"In this respect, the Michigan Supreme Court follows a familiar practice. The denial of a writ of certiorari in this Court imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case. United States v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 490, 43 S.Ct. 181, 67 L.Ed. 361 (1923). And the Michigan Supreme Court has long described its denials of applications for leave to appeal in the same terms. See, e.g., Malooly v. York Heating & Ventilating Corp., 270 Mich. 240, 246-247, 258 N.W. 622, 624 (1935), see also Mich. Ct. Rules 7.303(B)(1), 7.305(B)(1)-(3) (2021). In the past, too, this Court has treated lower Michigan court decisions as the relevant AEDPA adjudication despite discretionary denials of review by the State Supreme Court. Woods v. Donald, 575 U.S. 312, 314-315, 317, 135 S.Ct. 1372, 191 L.Ed.2d 464 (2015) (per curiam), Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. 12, 20, 134 S.Ct. 10, 187 L.Ed.2d 348 (2013), Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156, 161, 173, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,92,"Turning to the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals, Mr. Davenport principally argues that it was contrary to or an unreasonable application of this Court's decision in Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986). But it is hard to see how that could be the case. For one thing, Holbrook was a decision about whether a constitutional trial error occurred at all, not whether the alleged error was prejudicial. For another, Holbrook rejected the defendant's claim that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial when  the customary courtroom security force was supplemented by four uniformed state troopers sitting in the first row of the spectator's section. Id., at 562, 106 S.Ct. 1340. Nothing in that analysis is inconsistent with the Michigan Court of Appeals' disposition of Mr. Davenport's shackling claim.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,93,"Unable to make use of Holbrook's holding, Mr. Davenport once more asks us to turn our attention elsewhere. In particular, he notes that the trial court in Holbrook asked potential jurors at the outset of trial whether the presence of state troopers would affect their ability to consider fairly the defendant's case, they said no. This Court indicated that such questions and answers cannot alone dispositively resolve the question whether security measures prejudice a defendant's right to a fair trial. Id., at 570, 106 S.Ct. 1340. Instead, the Court reasoned that jurors will not necessarily be fully conscious of the effect such measures will have on their attitude toward the accused. This will be especially true when jurors are questioned at the very beginning of the proceedings, at that point, they can only speculate on how they will feel after being exposed to a practice daily over the course of a long trial. Ibid. Mr. Davenport highlights that the Court in Deck favorably quoted some of these passages too. 544 U.S., at 635, 125 S.Ct. 2007.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,94,"Even bearing all this in mind, however, we cannot see how the Michigan Court of Appeals acted contrary to or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law. The Michigan court found the shackling in Mr. Davenport's case harmless for two reasons —both because of the overwhelming evidence against him, and because jurors testified that his shackling did not  affect their verdict. 2012 WL 6217134, at *1-*2, and n. 2. Holbrook does not compel a different ruling on the first score. It addressed a different evidentiary record and affirmed the defendant's conviction.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,95,"Nor does the decision compel a different ruling on the second score. Holbrook cast doubt only on attempts to assess prejudice based on testimony from prospective jurors speculating about how the security measures might affect their perceptions over the course of an upcoming trial. Nothing in the decision purported to forbid courts from considering post-trial testimony about how trial security measures actually affected juror deliberations. Nor may this or any federal court use an AEDPA case as an opportunity to pass on the wisdom of extending old precedents in new ways. AEDPA permits relief only when a state court acts contrary to or unreasonably applies this Court's preexisting and clearly established rules. See, e.g., Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. 58, 64, 133 S.Ct. 1446, 185 L.Ed.2d 540 (2013) (per curiam), Woodall, 572 U.S., at 424-426, 134 S.Ct. 1697, Lopez, 574 U.S., at 6, 135 S.Ct. 1.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,96,"As a backup, Mr. Davenport suggests that the Michigan Court of Appeals committed an independent error by unreasonably applying Chapman. But Chapman merely announced the default burden of proof for evaluating constitutional errors on direct appeal: The prosecution must prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. 386 U.S., at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824. And this Court has repeatedly explained that, when it comes to AEDPA, the more general the federal rule, the more leeway state courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations before their decisions can be fairly labeled unreasonable. Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. 766, 776, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,97,"The case before us does not come close to exceeding that leeway. The Michigan Court of Appeals properly identified the controlling standard. 2012 WL 6217134, at *1.

Id., at *1-*2, and n. 2. Even if some fairminded jurist applying Chapman could reach a different conclusion, we cannot say that every fairminded jurist must.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-003,98,"Finally, in a variation on his Chapman argument, Mr. Davenport faults the Michigan Court of Appeals for unreasonably focusing on a false choice between first-degree murder and self-defense. Brief for Respondent 45. In his view, the state court improperly ignored the possibility that Mr. Davenport's shackling might have influenced the jury toward a conviction for first-degree murder rather than second-degree murder. But Mr. Davenport never presented this theory to the Michigan Court of Appeals. See Brief for Appellant in People v. Davenport, No. 306868, pp. 22-24 (arguing only that Mr. Davenport's shackling influenced jurors' receptiveness to his self-defense theory). Nor does it directly respond to what the state court called the overwhelming record evidence he committed murder in the first degree. In these circumstances we cannot say that every fairminded court would have both identified and adopted Mr. Davenport's forfeited theory.*  Even assuming Mr. Davenport met his burden under Brecht, he cannot do so under AEDPA.

Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), it need not also run through the test set out in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). That is because, we have both times explained, the Brecht standard obviously subsumes the more liberal AEDPA one: If a defendant meets the former, he will necessarily meet the latter too. Fry, 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321, Ayala, 576 U.S., at 270, 135 S.Ct. 2187.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,102,"Today, the Court discards those crystal-clear statements, subscribed to on each occasion by every Justice. The majority reverses the Court of Appeals for following our prior guidance, allowing the use of the Brecht test alone. And in declaring Brecht insufficient, the majority consigns future habeas courts to a regimen of make-work. Now those courts will have to jump through AEDPA's hoops as well, even though that extra analysis will never lead to a different result. I respectfully dissent from that pointless demand.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,104,"Because the majority begins with some law-chambers history, see ante, at 1520-1523, I do too—though fair warning: My discussion is no more relevant than the majority's to the issue before us. Not surprisingly, neither of the parties to this small and legally mundane case thought it a suitable occasion for a from-Blackstone-onward theory of habeas practice. Yet the majority, unprompted, embarks on that project, perhaps hoping that the seeds it sows now will yield more succulent fruit in cases to come. In the majority's story, post-conviction habeas relief was all but unavailable until the mid-20th century— when in an instant the Court in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953), upended the rules. That account repeats the views expressed in a recent concurrence, authored by the same Justice as today delivers the majority opinion. See Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U. S. ___, ___-___, 141 S.Ct. 1547, 209 L.Ed.2d 651 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., concurring) (Op., at 1566-1570), id., at ___, 141 S.Ct. 1547 (Op., at 1567) (Habeas historically provided no recourse for a prisoner confined pursuant to a final judgment of conviction). But the theory, in its fundamentals, is wrong. Federal courts long before Brown extended habeas relief to prisoners held in violation of the Constitution —even after a final conviction.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,105,"This Court started reviewing post-conviction constitutional claims under Congress's first grant of habeas authority, included in the Judiciary Act of 1789. That provision, applying only to federal prisoners, did not specifically provide for collateral review of constitutional claims. See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, § 14, 1 Stat. 81-82 (enabling federal courts to grant habeas  writs to inquire into the cause of a federal prisoner's commitment). But even without explicit permission, the Court in the mid-19th century invoked the habeas law to adjudicate those claims—including some from petitioners already convicted and sentenced. See 1 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 2.4di, p. 51 (7th ed. 2020). In Ex parte Wells, 59 U.S. 307, 18 How. 307, 15 L.Ed. 421 (1856), for example, only the dissent thought that the fact of a conviction and sentence precluded granting habeas relief (as today's opinion says was the firm rule). See id., at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting) (asserting that habeas could not aid a person imprisoned under a circuit court's criminal sentence). The majority, ignoring that objection, scrutinized the merits of the claim in detail before deciding that no constitutional violation had occurred and the applicant should remain in prison. Id., at 315, see id., at 309-315. And in Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1874), the Court (again acting under the original habeas law) went further: It granted relief to a convicted prisoner after finding a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court explained that it was carrying out a sacred duty in declaring that the prisoner was being held without authority, and that he should therefore be discharged. Id., at 178.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,106,"When Congress amended the Judiciary Act after the Civil War, the scope of federal habeas review—including over post-conviction claims—grew far larger. The text of the amendment (similar to current law) gave federal courts expansive power: to grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the Federal Constitution. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, 14 Stat. 385, see 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(a), (c)(3). And any person in all cases meant just that: State prisoners, not just federal ones, could now apply for habeas relief. Those state cases of course involved separate sovereigns, acting under their own laws. But even in that sphere, the Court soon decided that the federal judiciary's authority extended to hearing constitutional challenges to final convictions. Under the new statute, the Court explained, a single federal judge on habeas corpus could free a prisoner, after conviction in a State court, upon finding him unconstitutionally restrained. Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 253, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886). Or as held in another decision, a party was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus, even after his case had gone to conviction and sentence, when the state court had no constitutional authority or power to condemn him. In re Nielsen, 131 U.S. 176, 184, 9 S.Ct. 672, 33 L.Ed. 118 (1889). A leading treatise of the time summarized the state of the law: A federal court may, on habeas corpus, release one who is restrained of his liberty in violation of the constitution of the United States, though held under the criminal process of a state court, and either before or after judgment. W. Church, Writ of Habeas Corpus § 84, p. 117 (2d ed. 1893).",Kagan,0,
2021-003,107,"In line with that view, this Court granted habeas relief, on an assortment of constitutional grounds, to both federal and state prisoners challenging their convictions or sentences. The Court granted post-conviction relief to protect habeas applicants' rights to a grand jury indictment, to a jury trial, to assistance of counsel, and against self-incrimination. See, e.g., Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417, 425-426, 429, 5 S.Ct. 935, 29 L.Ed. 89 (1885), Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540, 547-548, 556-557, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 32 L.Ed. 223 (1888), Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 552, 585-586, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892), Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 467-469, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). The  Court granted post-conviction relief for violations of the Equal Protection Clause, the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto Clause. See, e.g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-374, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), Nielsen, 131 U.S., at 190-191, 9 S.Ct. 672, In re Medley, 134 U.S. 160, 170-173, 10 S.Ct. 384, 33 L.Ed. 835 (1890). And as due process rights expanded in the first half of the 20th century, the Court held post-conviction habeas relief proper for those claims too. See, e.g., Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 90-92, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543 (1923), Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 104-105, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942) (per curiam), Wade v. Mayo, 334 U.S. 672, 683-684, 68 S.Ct. 1270, 92 L.Ed. 1647 (1948).",Kagan,0,
2021-003,108,"The modern Court has repeatedly acknowledged that history. Over the years, the Court explained (referencing most of the cases cited above), the writ of habeas corpus evolved as a remedy available to effect discharge from any confinement contrary to the Constitution or fundamental law. Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 485, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Or again: Citing Wells and Lange (among others), the Court described how judicial decisions had expanded the availability of habeas relief to include challenges to final convictions. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 79, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). Or once more: The Court cited a string of 19th- and early 20th-century cases to illustrate how habeas had expanded to remedy convictions obtained under an unconstitutional statute or without adequate procedural protections for the defendant. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 478, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 317-318, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (citing McCleskey and Wainwright and noting the broadening of the scope of the writ to encompass review of constitutional error in criminal proceedings).",Kagan,0,
2021-003,109,"The majority tries to cram the many habeas decisions belying its position into a narrow jurisdictional exception, ante, at 1520-1521—but its effort does no more than reveal the peril of looking at history through a 21st-century lens. In the majority's view, a habeas court could grant relief only if the court of conviction lacked jurisdiction, not if it committed errors in adjudication. Ante, at 1520-1521, 1522. But some of the decisions the majority must contend with made no mention at all of the convicting (or sentencing) court's jurisdiction. See, e.g., Wells, 18 How., at 308-315, Yick Wo, 118 U.S., at 365-374, 6 S.Ct. 1064. And those that did so often used the word to mean something different from what it does today. The concept of jurisdictional defects (ante, at 1521) could at that time include—rather than contrast with—constitutional errors of the kind described above.1 As one legal historian puts the point: The jurisdictional inquiry was then (though of course not now) often merits based. A. Woolhandler, Demodeling Habeas, 45 Stan. L. Rev. 575, 630 (1993). That is why this Court could  say in the late 19th century that a court of conviction has jurisdiction only when, in taking custody of the accused, and in its modes of procedure to the determination of the question of his guilt or innocence, and in rendering judgment, the court keeps within the limitations prescribed by the law. In re Bonner, 151 U.S. 242, 257, 14 S.Ct. 323, 38 L.Ed. 149 (1894). Or why a roughly contemporaneous habeas treatise could state: No court has jurisdiction to imprison a person or detain him in custody in violation of the Constitution. 1 W. Bailey, Law of Habeas Corpus and Special Remedies § 25, p. 67 (1913). So the majority's supposedly narrow jurisdictional exception in fact allowed expansive relief: From the mid-1800s on, federal courts granted habeas writs to prisoners, federal and state alike, who on the way to conviction or sentence had suffered serious constitutional harms.2",Kagan,0,
2021-003,110,"Contrary to the majority, then, our decision in Brown built on decades and decades of history. No doubt, Brown was significant —a landmark of a kind—because it made explicit, and delineated in precise style, the broad scope of federal habeas. Wainwright, 433 U.S., at 79, 97 S.Ct. 2497. But the decision, as the leading modern treatise on habeas explains, worked no revolution. 1 Hertz & Liebman § 2.4dviii, at 73. Rather, the principles that Brownnicely catalogued were already long established, to anyone with the patience to search them out from among the literally hundreds of individually unimportant cases in which they lay dispersed. 1 Hertz & Liebman, at 73-75.3",Kagan,0,
2021-003,111,"So the majority should not be so sure that it really wishes judicially developed habeas doctrines to return the Great Writ closer to its historic office, ante, at 1523—at least if that office refers to the longstanding practice of the federal courts under a statute broadly authorizing habeas writs. The majority might then find itself bound to grant habeas relief, with more regularity and less compunction than it  would prefer, to address violations of convicted prisoners' constitutional rights.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,112,"But let's be frank: My view of the history, just like the majority's, has precious little—no, has nothing—to do with resolving this case. Although it is more entertaining to play amateur historian, it is past time to put in some work on the technical issue before us: what standard(s) a habeas court should use to decide whether a state trial court's constitutional error was harmless.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,114,"Except that little work is in truth necessary —because we have already, and unanimously, resolved that question twice before.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,115,"To see how (and why) we have done so, first consider the two possible answers. As the majority frames it, the choice is between (1) applying the Brecht standard alone (as Ervine Davenport wants) and (2) applying both Brecht and AEDPA (as the State desires). See ante, at 1517, 1524. (Trust me: I will in a moment set out what those standards are.) That formulation of the choice is appropriate as shorthand, indeed, I will use it myself. But it remains an oversimplification. For in arguing that the Brecht test suffices, Davenport does not contend that a federal habeas court may simply ignore AEDPA. Although the majority veils the point, Davenport readily acknowledges that a court must always comply with AEDPA's limitation on the legal materials a court may consult and draw on to justify habeas relief. Ante, at 1525-1526, see Brief for Respondent 16-17 (explaining that a court's Brecht analysis is sufficient only if it relies exclusively on the legal and factual materials allowed under AEDPA). All Davenport claims is that if the habeas court confines itself to using AEDPA-approved materials, then it need only find the Brecht standard met to grant relief.4 That means (here, finally, is the Brecht standard) the court has to find actual prejudice—more specifically, that there is grave doubt about whether an error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on a verdict. Brecht, 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 436, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). But no more is required: The court need not, Davenport says, separately apply the AEDPA test. Which means it does not have to analyze (here is the AEDPA test) whether the state appellate court acted unreasonably, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), when it decided, under Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), that an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Is Davenport right?",Kagan,0,
2021-003,116,"This Court (first) made clear in Fry v. Pliler that he is. The question there was whether a federal habeas court should assess harmless error under Brecht (rather than Chapman) even when the state court had failed to make the harmlessness finding Chapman requires on direct review. Justice Scalia, speaking for a unanimous Court, explained why the habeas court should still apply Brecht: Use of the defendant-friendly Chapman test on habeas would undermine the States' interest in  the finality of convictions. 551 U.S., at 117, 127 S.Ct. 2321 (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710). But Fry raised an objection. In recently enacting AEDPA, he claimed, Congress had abolished the Brecht test—replacing it with a new AEDPA/Chapman standard of review. That argument, of course, differs from Davenport's. See ante, at 1526-1527. But the Court's reply, in describing the relationship between Brecht and AEDPA, answers today's question:",Kagan,0,
2021-003,117,"Given our frequent recognition that AEDPA limited rather than expanded the availability of habeas relief, it is implausible that, without saying so, AEDPA replaced the Brecht standard of actual prejudice with the more liberal AEDPA/Chapman standard which requires only that the state court's harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt determination be unreasonable. That said, it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests (AEDPA/Chapman and Brecht) when the latter obviously subsumes the former. 551 U.S., at 119-120, 127 S.Ct. 2321 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).",Kagan,0,
2021-003,118,"That passage is clear on its face, as Justice Scalia's opinions typically are. But because the majority pretends it does not say what it says, see ante, at 1526-1527, it is worth going over. The key points are two. First, the Brecht standard is harder for a prisoner to meet—i.e., less liberal—than the AEDPA/Chapman standard. And second, because that is so—because Brecht so obviously subsumes AEDPA/Chapman—it makes no sense to require a court to formally apply both. Just apply Brecht and be done with it. Not in some cases, and not in select scenarios, as today's majority imagines. Ante, at 1526-1527. But as a rule. Because if a prisoner can satisfy Brecht, he can obviously satisfy AEDPA/Chapman, and courts should not have to do needless work.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,119,"But we need not take Fry's word for the point, because the Court in Davis v. Ayala reaffirmed everything Justice Scalia said. In Ayala, a federal court held on habeas that a state trial error caused actual prejudice under Brecht. This Court disagreed and reversed, but it made clear that the Brecht test governed. See 576 U.S., at 267, 135 S.Ct. 2187 (In a collateral proceeding, the test is Brecht's actual prejudice standard). After describing that standard (with stress on its strictness), the Court addressed its relation to AEDPA. Brecht in no way abrogates AEDPA, the Court noted. 576 U.S., at 268, 135 S.Ct. 2187. But the Court explained—several times over— that Brecht makes AEDPA functionally immaterial on matters relating to harmlessness. In Fry, the Ayala Court began, we held that the Brecht standard `subsumes' the requirements that AEDPA imposes when a federal habeas petitioner contests a state court's determination that a constitutional error was harmless under Chapman. 576 U.S., at 268, 135 S.Ct. 2187. Because that is so, Ayala continued (again quoting Fry), a federal habeas court need not `formally' apply both Brecht and `AEDPA/Chapman.' 576 U.S., at 268, 135 S.Ct. 2187 (alteration in original). And if that were not clear enough, the Court reprised: In sum, a prisoner who seeks federal habeas corpus relief must satisfy Brecht, and if the state court adjudicated his claim on the merits, the Brecht test subsumes the limitations imposed by AEDPA. Id., at 270, 135 S.Ct. 2187. But still, the Court was not done. In turning to whether the error at issue had caused Ayala harm, the Court noted that he necessarily would not satisfy Brecht if he had failed to satisfy AEDPA/Chapman—which is the flipside of saying he necessarily would satisfy AEDPA/Chapman if he had satisfied Brecht. 576 U.S., at 270, 135 S.Ct.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,120,"2187. Both are a function, once again, of Brecht obviously subsuming AEDPA/Chapman.5",Kagan,0,
2021-003,121,"Today's majority contorts Ayala, too, beyond recognition. The majority insists that only a carefully curated snippet of that decision—one sentence, in fact—cuts against today's holding. Ante, at 1527 1528. But see all the quotations above. Ayala repeats the key point favoring Davenport —that a court applying Brecht need not separately apply AEDPA—multiple times over a span of more than three pages (with the rest of that section providing supportive analysis). See 576 U.S., at 267-270, 135 S.Ct. 2187. Similarly, the majority asserts that the word subsumes, as introduced in Fry and echoed in Ayala, does not really mean subsumes—which is to say, fully encompasses as a component element. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1246 (11th ed. 2005). Rather, when the greatest wordsmith in modern Supreme Court history used the term to describe the relationship between two legal tests, he really meant (more precisely meant (!), ante, at 1527-1528) that they merely overlapped—so that sometimes a person meeting one test necessarily meets the other, but then again, sometimes not. If all this shows respect for past judgments, as the majority declares, ibid., then that phrase too has an unconventional meaning. What Ayala held, adhering to Fry, was that anytime a habeas petitioner satisfies Brecht, he of necessity satisfies AEDPA/Chapman. And because that is so, a habeas court need not apply both. I hate to assign homework to readers of Supreme Court opinions, but if you don't know what to make of the majority's and my contrasting descriptions of Fry and Ayala: well, just go read them.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,122,"The majority departs from those two decisions because it disagrees with what they said. The straightforward basis of Fry and Ayala, as just described, is that the AEDPA/Chapman test is more liberal than the Brecht test—i.e., easier for the habeas petitioner to meet. Fry, 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321. (That is why, Fry explained, the Congress enacting AEDPA—intent as it was on limiting habeas —could not have meant to replace Brecht.) The majority here asserts that this view of the two tests is just not true. Its theory goes: Whereas AEDPA asks whether every fairminded jurist would find the requisite prejudice, Brecht asks only whether a federal habeas court itself would do so. Ante, at 1525 (emphasis in original).",Kagan,0,
2021-003,123,"But that description tells only part of the story—and not the most important part. Consider a fuller description of what a habeas court addressing the prejudicial effect of an error asks under each standard. See supra, at 1535-1536. Applying AEDPA, the court asks whether the state court acted unreasonably in finding (under Chapman) that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt— meaning that there is no reasonable possibility it might have contributed to the conviction. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), Chapman, 386 U.S., at 23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824. Applying Brecht, the court instead asks whether the error was actually prejudicial —meaning that there is, at a minimum, grave doubt about whether an error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on a verdict. Brecht, 507 U.S., at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, O'Neal, 513 U.S., at 435-436, 115 S.Ct. 992. The majority is  quite right to note that AEDPA's language of reasonableness directs a court to think about how all fairminded jurists would approach a question, while Brecht tells a court to decide a question for itself. Cf. ante, at 1526, n. 3 (somehow still asserting that I paper over this difference). But what the majority obscures is that those two questions are starkly different. A court doing AEDPA puts a reasonableness overlay on the Chapman question, a court doing Brecht of course asks the Brecht question. And the Chapman question —see just above—is far easier for a defendant to prevail on. Accord, ante, at 1523-1524. (That is why the Brecht test was created—to better protect the finality of convictions on habeas. See Brecht, 507 U.S., at 637-638, 113 S.Ct. 1710.) So much easier, indeed, that Fry thought it self-evident (obvious) that even with the AEDPA overlay, the Chapman inquiry would require the release of more prisoners. Fry, 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321.",Kagan,0,
2021-003,124,"The relationship between Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman means that today's holding will make no difference to habeas outcomes. Consider a court that has found the Brecht test satisfied: It has, at the least, grave doubt about the error affecting the verdict. Will that same court say that a reasonable jurist could find no such effect beyond a reasonable doubt—that the jurist could deny there was even a reasonable possibility of the error mattering? The answer is no. And that is not just what our precedents say. It is also what the real world shows. Several Circuits formerly followed the rule the majority announces today: Habeas courts there could not grant relief before separately applying Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman. Yet neither the majority nor the State has come up with a single case (nor have I) in which a court held that a petitioner satisfied Brecht but not AEDPA/Chapman. Which for all the reasons Fry, Ayala, and I have given is no wonder. Apply Brecht alone or apply both Brecht and AEDPA: The same people will, and will not, receive habeas relief.6",Kagan,0,
2021-003,125,"All today's holding does going forward is compel habeas courts, and the parties before them, to spin their wheels. All it does is what Fry observed certainly makes no sense: require formal application of two tests when only one—Brecht—matters. 551 U.S., at 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321. Of course, it is not the worst thing in the world to have to do unnecessary work of this kind, parties and courts alike will find ways to limit the inefficiencies involved. But really, why should they have to? Our prior decisions got the question here right. The courts that have followed their instructions did everything needed. Better, by far, to have left it at that.",Kagan,0,
2021-004,26,"In 2006, a stray 9-millimeter bullet killed a 2-year-old child in the Bronx.

2021-004,27,"Years later, the State prosecuted petitioner Darrell Hemphill for the same murder. At his trial, Hemphill blamed Morris, and he elicited undisputed testimony from a prosecution witness that police had recovered 9-millimeter ammunition from Morris' nightstand. Morris was outside the United States and not available to testify. The trial court allowed the State to introduce parts of the transcript of Morris' plea allocution as evidence to rebut Hemphill's theory that Morris committed the murder. The court reasoned that Hemphill's arguments and evidence had opened the door to the introduction of these testimonial out-of-court statements, not subjected to cross-examination, because they were `reasonably necessary' to `correct' the `misleading impression' Hemphill had created.

2021-004,33,"The police arrested Morris the next day and observed bruising on his knuckles consistent with fist fighting. Gilliam then surrendered and identified Morris as the shooter. Gilliam later returned to the police station and recanted, stating that Hemphill, Gilliam's cousin, had in fact been the shooter. Investigators initially did not credit Gilliam's recantation, instead, the State charged Morris with the child's murder and for possession of a 9-millimeter handgun. After opening statements at Morris' 2008 trial, however, the State decided not to oppose Morris' application for a mistrial to allow the State to reconsider the charges against him.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,34,"Approximately six weeks later, the State agreed to dismiss the murder charges against Morris if he pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon. But rather than having Morris plead to the charge in the existing indictment for possession of a 9-millimeter handgun, the State filed a new charge alleging that Morris had possessed a .357-magnum revolver, a different type of firearm than the one used to kill the victim. In exchange for this plea, the prosecution recommended a sentence of time served. The State and Morris' counsel agreed that there was insufficient evidence of Morris' possession of a .357-magnum revolver to obtain an indictment absent Morris' willingness to admit to the allegations. Morris did so, against his attorney's advice, to secure his release that day.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,35,"In 2011, the State learned that Hemphill's DNA matched a sample from a blue sweater that police had recovered in a search of Gilliam's apartment shortly after the crime. Eyewitnesses had described the shooter as wearing a blue shirt or sweater. In 2013, Hemphill was arrested and indicted for the murder.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,37,"At trial, Hemphill pursued a third-party culpability defense by blaming Morris for the shooting. In his opening statement, Hemphill's counsel noted that officers had recovered 9-millimeter ammunition from Morris' nightstand hours after a 9-millimeter bullet killed the victim. The State did not object, but later contended that Hemphill's argument had been misleading because officers also had found .357-caliber bullets on the nightstand and because Morris ultimately pleaded guilty to possessing a .357 revolver.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,38,"Morris, however, was unavailable to testify at Hemphill's trial. As a result, the State sought to introduce the transcript of Morris' plea allocution to suggest that he had possessed only a .357 revolver. Hemphill's counsel objected, arguing that the plea allocution was clearly hearsay and that Hemphill was being deprived of an opportunity for cross-examination. App. 107. The trial court deferred ruling and, in the meantime, allowed the State to put on testimony regarding the .357-caliber bullets on Morris' nightstand. Accordingly, both the State and Hemphill elicited undisputed testimony from a law enforcement officer that a 9-millimeter cartridge and.357-caliber bullets were recovered from Morris' nightstand.",Sotomayor,0,

In Reid, New York's highest court held that a criminal defendant could open the door to evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause if the evidence was `reasonably necessary to correct a misleading impression' made by the defense's `evidence or argument.' Id., at 388, 948 N.Y.S.2d at 227, 971 N.E.2d, at 357 (quoting People v. Massie, 2 N.Y.3d 179, 184, 777 N.Y.S.2d 794, 797, 809 N.E.2d 1102, 1105 (2004)). The trial court applied Reid as follows:",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,42,"A significant aspect of the defense in this case is that Morris, who was originally prosecuted for this homicide, was, in fact, the actual shooter and that as such, the defendant, Hemphill, was excluded as the shooter. There is, however, evidence contrary to the argument presented by the defense in this case . In my judgment, the defense's argument, which in all respects is appropriate and under the circumstances of this case probably a necessary argument to make, nonetheless, opens the door to evidence offered by the State refuting the claim that Morris was, in fact, the shooter. App. 184, 185.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,43,"Based on this ruling, the State published to the jury the portions of the transcript of Morris' plea hearing containing Morris' admission to possessing a .357 revolver and his counsel's statements that he was doing so against counsel's advice, without corroborating evidence, in order to get out of jail immediately.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,44,"Hemphill premised his closing argument, like the rest of his defense, on the theory that Morris was the shooter. The State, in its closing, cited Morris' plea allocution and emphasized that possession of a .357 revolver, not murder, was the crime Morris actually committed. Id., at 356. After deliberations spanning multiple days, the jury found Hemphill guilty, and the court sentenced him to 25 years to life in prison.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,46,"Hemphill appealed. Before the Appellate Division, he argued, citing the State and Federal Constitutions, that the court denied Mr. Hemphill his right to confront the witness against him where it admitted Nicholas Morris's guilty plea statements because the defense had opened the door to this evidence even though counsel had scrupulously followed the court's in limine rulings. Supp. App. to Brief in Opposition SA107.

2021-004,47,"The Appellate Division affirmed. In relevant part, it reasoned that during the trial, defendant created a misleading impression  that Morris possessed a 9 millimeter handgun, which was consistent with the type used in the murder, and introduction of the plea allocution was reasonably necessary to correct that misleading impression.

2021-004,53,"This Court has almost unfailingly refused to consider any federal-law challenge to a state-court decision unless the federal claim `was either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we have been asked to review.' Howell v. Mississippi, 543 U.S. 440, 443, 125 S.Ct. 856, 160 L.Ed.2d 873 (2005) (per curiam) (quoting Adams v. Robertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86, 117 S.Ct. 1028, 137 L.Ed.2d 203 (1997) (per curiam)). `No particular form of words or phrases is essential' for satisfying the presentation requirement, so long as the claim is `brought to the attention of the state court with fair precision and in due time.' Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 584, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969) (quoting New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, 278 U.S. 63, 67, 49 S.Ct. 61, 73 L.Ed. 184 (1928)).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,54,"Hemphill has satisfied this requirement. At every level of his proceedings in state court, Hemphill argued that the admission of Morris' plea allocution violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation as interpreted by this Court in Crawford. Before the trial court, Hemphill timely objected that admission of the plea allocution would be a Crawford violation. App. 160. Before the Appellate Division, he argued that the trial court denied Mr. Hemphill his 6th Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. Supp. App. to Brief in Opposition SA108. And before the Court of Appeals, he contended that the Appellate Division's analysis, which had affirmed the trial court's admission of the plea allocution, is absurd in the context of the Confrontation Clause, the purpose of which is to afford the accused the right to meaningfully test the prosecution's proof. App. 388. Once a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992). The Court may therefore consider any argument Hemphill raises in support of his claim that he did not forfeit his right to exclude evidence otherwise barred by the Confrontation Clause by opening the door to responsive evidence. Pet. for Cert. i.2  Accordingly, the Court turns to the merits of that claim.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,57,"One of the bedrock constitutional protections afforded to criminal defendants is the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which states: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right  to be confronted with the witnesses against him.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,58,"In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), this Court had held that this confrontation right did not bar the admission of statements of an unavailable witness so long as those statements had adequate `indicia of reliability,' meaning that they fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or otherwise bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. However, 24 years later, this Court rejected that reliability-based approach to the Confrontation Clause. See Crawford, 541 U.S., at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,59,"In charting a different path, the Crawford Court examined the history of the confrontation right at common law and concluded that the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused. Id., at 50, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Court continued, the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Id., at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.4 Because the text of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developed by the courts, the requirement was most naturally read to admit only those exceptions established at the time of the founding. Id., at 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, see also Giles v. California, 554 U.S. 353, 377, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (declining to approve an exception to the Confrontation  Clause unheard of at the time of the founding or for 200 years thereafter).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,61,"The State accepts all of the foregoing principles. It does not dispute that Morris' plea allocution was testimonial, meaning that it implicated Hemphill's rights under the Confrontation Clause. Nor does the State argue that the opening the door rule announced in People v. Reid and applied in Hemphill's case was an exception to the right to confrontation at common law.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,62,"The State's primary contention is that the Reid rule is not an exception to the Confrontation Clause at all. Brief for Respondent 36. Instead, the State attempts to characterize the Reid rule as a mere procedural rule that treats the misleading door-opening actions of counsel as the equivalent of failing to object to the confrontation violation. Brief for Respondent 31. So construed, the argument goes, the Reid rule limits only the manner of asserting the confrontation right, not its substantive scope.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,63,"It is true that the Sixth Amendment leaves States with flexibility to adopt reasonable procedural rules governing the exercise of a defendant's right to confrontation. For example, States are free to adopt procedural rules governing objections, including contemporaneous objection requirements and, in the context of forensic evidence, notice-and-demand statutes. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 327, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009). In addition, the Confrontation Clause will not bar a defendant's removal from a courtroom if, despite repeated warnings, he insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,64,"The door-opening principle incorporated in Reid, however, is not a member of this class of procedural rules. Rather, it is a substantive principle of evidence that dictates what material is relevant and admissible in a case. See Massie, 2 N.Y.3d, at 182-484, 777 N.Y.S.2d, at 796-797, 809 N.E.2d, at 1104-1105 (citing People v. Melendez, 55 N.Y.2d 445, 449 N.Y.S.2d 946, 434 N.E.2d 1324 (1982), a case about the admissibility of hearsay testimony, as the leading case in this Court on `opening the door'), New York State Unified Court System, Guide to New York Evidence Rule 4.08 (2021) (explaining the open the door principle as a rule of evidence). As this case illustrates, the principle requires a trial court to determine whether one party's evidence and arguments, in the context of the full record, have created a misleading impression that requires correction with additional material from the other side.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,65,"Moreover, the State's argument would negate Crawford's emphatic rejection of the reliability-based approach of Ohio v. Roberts. If Crawford stands for anything, it is that the history, text, and purpose of the Confrontation Clause bar judges from substituting their own determinations of reliability for the method the Constitution guarantees. The Clause commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. Crawford, 541 U.S., at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354. It thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined. Ibid. A mere judicial determination regarding the reliability of evidence is no substitute for  the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability. Id., at 62, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The upshot is that the role of the trial judge is not, for Confrontation Clause purposes, to weigh the reliability or credibility of testimonial hearsay evidence, it is to ensure that the Constitution's procedures for testing the reliability of that evidence are followed.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,66,"The trial court here violated this principle by admitting unconfronted, testimonial hearsay against Hemphill simply because the judge deemed his presentation to have created a misleading impression that the testimonial hearsay was reasonably necessary to correct. For Confrontation Clause purposes, it was not for the judge to determine whether Hemphill's theory that Morris was the shooter was unreliable, incredible, or otherwise misleading in light of the State's proffered, unconfronted plea evidence. Nor, under the Clause, was it the judge's role to decide that this evidence was reasonably necessary to correct that misleading impression. Such inquiries are antithetical to the Confrontation Clause.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,68,"The State next insists that the Reid rule is necessary to safeguard the truth-finding function of courts because it prevents the selective and misleading introduction of evidence. See Reid, 19 N.Y.3d, at 388, 948 N.Y.S.2d, at 227, 971 N.E.2d, at 357. The State relies on this Court's precedents recognizing the need for sensitivity to `the legitimate demands of the adversarial system.' Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 413, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988) (quoting United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 241, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), emphasis deleted). This argument falls short as well. Even as it has recognized and reaffirmed the vital truth-seeking function of a trial, the Court has not allowed such considerations to override the rights the Constitution confers upon criminal defendants.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,69,"The State cites a series of cases in which this Court permitted a State to impeach a defendant using evidence that would normally be barred from use at trial. Brief for Respondent 32 (citing Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U.S. 586, 129 S.Ct. 1841, 173 L.Ed.2d 801 (2009), Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954)). None of those cases, however, involved exceptions to constitutional requirements. Rather, in each case, the Court considered the appropriate scope of a prophylactic rule designed to remedy a violation that had already occurred. Ventris, 556 U.S., at 593, 129 S.Ct. 1841. For example, the Court distinguished violations of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches or seizures from the prophylactic rule designed to deter violations of that guarantee by excluding the fruits of such searches or seizures from trial. Id., at 590-591, 129 S.Ct. 1841. Because the prophylactic exclusionary rule is a deterrent sanction rather than a substantive guarantee, the Court applied a balancing test to allow States to impeach defendants with the fruits of prior Fourth Amendment violations, even though the rule barred the admission of such fruits in the State's case-in-chief. Id., at 591, 129 S.Ct. 1841 (citing Walder, 347 U.S., at 65, 74 S.Ct. 354).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,70,"In contrast, the Court has not held that defendants can open the door to violations of constitutional requirements merely by making evidence relevant to contradict their defense. Thus, in New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 450, 458-459, 99 S.Ct. 1292, 59 L.Ed.2d 501 (1979), the Court rejected a State's effort to impeach a defendant through the introduction of his own coerced testimony. It did so despite  the strong and obvious interest in preventing perjury because the very introduction of the coerced testimony would violate the Fifth Amendment's provision that no person  shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. In view of that guarantee, balancing of interests was not simply unnecessary, but impermissible. Portash, 440 U.S., at 459, 99 S.Ct. 1292. The Sixth Amendment speaks with equal clarity: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right  to be confronted with the witnesses against him. It admits no exception for cases in which the trial judge believes unconfronted testimonial hearsay might be reasonably necessary to correct a misleading impression. Courts may not overlook its command, no matter how noble the motive. See United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 145, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) (It is true enough that the purpose of the rights set forth in the Sixth Amendment is to ensure a fair trial, but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,72,"The State warns that a reversal will leave prosecutors without recourse to protect against abuses of the confrontation right. These concerns are overstated. State and federal hearsay rules generally preclude all parties from introducing unreliable, out-of-court statements for the truth of the matter asserted. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 802. Even for otherwise admissible evidence, well-established rules, such as Federal Rule of Evidence 403, permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury. Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 326, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006). If a court admits evidence before its misleading or unfairly prejudicial nature becomes apparent, it generally retains the authority to withdraw it, strike it, or issue a limiting instruction as appropriate. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 105, New York State Unified Court System, Guide to New York Evidence Rule 1.13(1) (Absent undue prejudice to a party, a judge may revisit his or her own evidentiary rulings during trial).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,73,"Finally, the Court does not decide today the validity of the common-law rule of completeness as applied to testimonial hearsay. Under that rule, a party `against whom a part of an utterance has been put in, may in his turn complement it by putting in the remainder.' Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. 153, 171, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988) (quoting 7 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2113, p. 653 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1978)), see also Fed. Rule Evid. 106. The parties agree that the rule of completeness does not apply to the facts of this case, as Morris' plea allocution was not part of any statement that Hemphill introduced. Whether and under what circumstances that rule might allow the admission of testimonial hearsay against a criminal defendant presents different issues that are not before this Court.5* * *  The Confrontation Clause requires that the reliability and veracity of the evidence against a criminal defendant be tested by cross-examination, not determined by a trial court. The trial court's admission of unconfronted testimonial hearsay over Hemphill's objection, on the view that it was reasonably necessary to correct Hemphill's misleading argument, violated that fundamental guarantee. The judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,74,It is so ordered.,Sotomayor,0,
2021-004,75,"Justice ALITO, with whom Justice KAVANAUGH joins, concurring.",Alito,0,
2021-004,76,I agree with the Court's conclusion that—assuming Morris's statement was testimonial—its admission violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. I write separately to address the conditions under which a defendant can be deemed to have validly waived the right to confront adverse witnesses.,Alito,0,
2021-004,77,"The question of a waiver of a federally guaranteed constitutional right is, of course, a federal question controlled by federal law. Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 4, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966). Waiver consists in the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). But a valid waiver need not be express. Implied waiver can be established through `a course of conduct' even absent formal or express statements of waiver. Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370, 383-384, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (quoting North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979)). In the prototypical case of implied waiver, the relevant course of conduct signals an intention to relinquish the right at issue. But as a general proposition, the law can presume that an individual who, with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish the protection those rights afford. Berghuis, 560 U.S., at 385, 130 S.Ct. 2250.",Alito,0,
2021-004,78,"Our precedents establish that a defendant can impliedly waive the Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses through conduct.* The cause of implied waiver can be a failure to object to the offending evidence in accordance with the procedural standards fixed by state law. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 314, n. 3, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009). But implied waiver can also occur when a defendant engages in a course of conduct that is incompatible with a demand to confront adverse witnesses. In Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970), for instance, we held that a defendant may relinquish his right to confront adverse witnesses by conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom. Id., at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057.",Alito,0,
2021-004,79,"The problem with the New York rule at issue in this case is that its application is predicated on neither conduct evincing intent  to relinquish the right of confrontation nor action inconsistent with the assertion of that right. The introduction of evidence that is misleading as to the real facts does not, in itself, indicate a decision regarding whether any given declarant should be subjected to cross-examination. Nor is that kind of maneuver inconsistent with the assertion of the right to confront a declarant whose out-of-court statements could potentially set the record straight.",Alito,0,
2021-004,80,"There are other circumstances, however, under which a defendant's introduction of evidence may be regarded as an implicit waiver of the right to object to the prosecution's use of evidence that might otherwise be barred by the Confrontation Clause. Under the traditional rule of completeness, if a party introduces all or part of a declarant's statement, the opposing party is entitled to introduce the remainder of that statement or another related statement by the same declarant, regardless of whether the statement is testimonial or there was a prior opportunity to confront the declarant. See, e.g., 1 B. Bergman, N. Hollander, & T. Duncan, Wharton's Criminal Evidence § 4:10 (15th ed. 1997) (explaining rule of completeness and collecting cases), Fed. Rule Evid. 106 (partially codifying rule of completeness with respect to writings and recorded statements).",Alito,0,
2021-004,81,"The rule of completeness fits comfortably within the concept of implied waiver. By introducing part or all of a statement made by an unavailable declarant, a defendant has made a knowing and voluntary decision to permit that declarant to appear as an unconfronted witness. As a result, the defendant cannot consistently maintain that the remainder of the declarant's statement or the declarant's other statements on the same subject should not be admitted due to the impossibility of cross-examining that declarant. The defendant's decision to present the statement of an unavailable declarant is inconsistent with the simultaneous assertion of the Sixth Amendment right to subject that declarant to cross-examination.",Alito,0,

The remainder of the declarant's statement or statements —and any other statements by the same declarant on the same subject—are fair game. The defendant cannot reasonably claim otherwise, given his tactical choice to put the declarant's statements on the relevant subject in contention despite his unavailability for cross-examination. And that is true regardless of whether the defendant attempts to invoke his right to confront an unavailable declarant after introducing his out-of-court statements.

2021-004,92,"Here, there was no contest upon any federal claim in the New York Court of Appeals. In his briefing before that court, Hemphill asserted that the only issue before that Court was whether the defense opened the door to Morris's testimonial hearsay. App. 385 (emphasis added). To that end, Hemphill argued that his defense's presentation of evidence was not misleading under Massie, Reid, and other cases. See App. 386-387. Of course, whether Hemphill triggered New York's substantive principle of evidence, ante, at 691, is a question of state law not subject to review here, Moore v.

Federal law does not govern whether a defendant's presentation of his case is misleading. Thus, Hemphill pressed only a state-law claim in the New York Court of Appeals.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,93,"True, Hemphill cited one Sixth Amendment precedent, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and stated that the introduction of Morris's guilty plea minutes violated his Sixth Amendment right. App. 385. But Hemphill reached that conclusion not because there was a real contest  upon the constitutionality of the Reid rule, Morrison, 154 U.S., at 115, 14 S.Ct. 995, but rather because the trial court misapplied Reid and thus improperly admitted unconfronted testimonial hearsay. Put another way, Hemphill never argued that evidence that complied with Reid violated the Confrontation Clause. To the contrary, Hemphill understood Reid to be constitutional. As Hemphill explained, both the trial judge and the Appellate Division recognized that Morris' statements would otherwise be barred by the Confrontation Clause if he had not opened the door. App. 385. (emphasis added). In short, everyone agreed on what the Sixth Amendment required, the only dispute was whether the trial court misapplied New York's door-opening doctrine.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,94,"The Court declines to address the substance of Hemphill's argument in the Court of Appeals. It focuses instead on Hemphill's remark, toward the end of his analysis, that the Appellate Division's ruling unjustifiably undermined the right to confrontation and was absurd in the context of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 388. But this was not a challenge to the constitutionality of the Reid rule, rather, it was an explanation why the Appellate Division's approach to Reid represented a radical shift never adopted by the New York Court of Appeals in Reid or its progeny. App. 388. Hemphill repeated that charge at length in his reply brief. See id., at 404-406. Notably, he faulted the trial court for its basic misunderstanding of the Reid doctrine. Id., at 406. Thus, as before, Hemphill challenged only the misapplication of state law.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,95,"Nonetheless, even if the Court were correct that Hemphill's fleeting reference to the Confrontation Clause addressed the constitutionality of the Reid rule, Hemphill still would not have raised a properly  presented federal claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1257. Adams, 520 U.S. at 86, 117 S.Ct. 1028. For more than a century, this Court has held that a general statement that the decision of a court is against the constitutional rights of the objecting party  will not raise a federal question. Clarke v. McDade, 165 U.S. 168, 172, 17 S.Ct. 284, 41 L.Ed. 673 (1897), see also Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. McGuire, 196 U.S. 128, 131, 25 S.Ct. 200, 49 L.Ed. 413 (1905) (mere suggestion of a violation of a Federal right— rather than the distinct presentation of a Federal question—is inadequate). A litigant must adequately develop any federal claim in his state briefing in order to give the state court a fair opportunity to assess the claim. Adams, 520 U.S., at 87, 117 S.Ct. 1028 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Court highlights two statements from Hemphill's state-court briefing that, at best, offered a general and unreasoned assertion that the New York courts violated the Sixth Amendment. Such an unspecific statement manifestly failed to give the Court of Appeals a fair opportunity to assess any constitutional claim.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,96,"The Court tacitly recognizes that its chosen excerpts from Hemphill's brief are inadequate. It asserts that Hemphill, after making those statements, proceeded to explain the basis for a Confrontation Clause claim. Ante, at 689-690, n. 2. The record demonstrates otherwise. Hemphill did not cite a single case. He made no legal argument. In fact, he did not even address the right to confront adverse witnesses. Rather, Hemphill lamented that, as a practical matter, the Appellate Division's approach created a minefield for counsel in which the only way for the accused to rely on the rules of evidence or constitutional protections is to remain mute. App. 388. This general grievance about the inability to present evidence or argument in defense says nothing about the Confrontation Clause. To the contrary, under our precedents, the right to present a defense in a state criminal trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967). A claim under those provisions would not preserve a Confrontation Clause claim. See Gates, 462 U.S., at 219-220, 103 S.Ct. 2317. It follows that Hemphill's assertion about the practicalities of criminal defense, with no citation to any authority, is even more obviously inadequate.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,97,"Ultimately, the Court all but concedes Hemphill's failure to develop his claim below, but relies on Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992), for the proposition that we may consider any argument Hemphill raises in support of his claim. Ante, at 689. But Yee still requires a federal claim to be properly presented to the state court, even if a new argument in support of that claim is raised for the first time here. 503 U.S., at 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522. So, in Yee, the Fifth Amendment taking claim was properly presented because the petitioners unquestionably raised that claim in the state courts based on a physical taking argument, and it was unclear only whether they also raised a related regulatory taking argument. Ibid. Here, by contrast, Hemphill developed no basis for any federal claim before the Court of Appeals. Yee is therefore inapplicable and § 1257 bars this Court's review.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,99,"Hemphill's failure to properly present his Sixth Amendment claim to the New York Court of Appeals divests this Court of jurisdiction. To be sure, on rare occasions, this Court has excused the failure to present a federal claim in state court. See, e.g., Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold  Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U.S. 877, 883, 106 S.Ct. 2305, 90 L.Ed.2d 881 (1986). Our insistence on proper presentation has been `almost,' though not completely, `unfailing.' Ante, at 688-689 (quoting Howell v. Mississippi, 543 U.S. 440, 443, 125 S.Ct. 856, 160 L.Ed.2d 873 (2005) (per curiam)). But, in my view, the Court's recent treatment of § 1257's proper-presentation requirement as merely prudential is erroneous. We have no authority to forgive a petitioner's failure to raise a federal claim in state court, because the proper-presentation requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review. Absent jurisdiction, the only appropriate remedy is dismissal.1",Thomas,0,
2021-004,100,"Since the Judiciary Act of 1789, § 25, 1 Stat. 85, Congress has permitted this Court to review the judgments of state courts only when petitioners properly present their federal claims to those courts below. See Gates, 462 U.S., at 218, 103 S.Ct. 2317. This Court's earliest cases held that the absence of a federal claim in the state court defeats this Court's jurisdiction. See, e.g., Owings v. Norwood's Lessee, 5 Cranch 344, 347 (1809). Justice Story explained: To give this court appellate jurisdiction two things should have occurred and be apparent in the record: first, that some one of the federal questions did arise in the court below, and secondly, that a decision was actually made thereon by the same court. Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 392 (1836).2 That conclusion was unremarkable given that the proper presentation requirement has always appeared in this Court's only statutory grant of jurisdiction to review statecourt decisions.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,101,"For nearly 200 years, this Court adhered to the proper-presentation requirement as a jurisdictional rule. The Court routinely dismissed cases for lack of jurisdiction when the petitioner failed to properly present his federal claim to the state court. See, e.g., Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County, 166 U.S. 648, 660, 17 S.Ct. 709, 41 L.Ed. 1149 (1897), Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Slade, 216 U.S. 78, 83-84, 30 S.Ct. 230, 54 L.Ed. 390 (1910), Cardinale v.

Even a century ago, it was well settled that this Court was without jurisdiction to review the judgment of a State court  by reason of a federal question which was not raised below or called to the attention of or decided by the State court. New York ex rel. Rosevale Realty Co. v. Kleinert, 268 U.S. 646, 650, 45 S.Ct. 618, 69 L.Ed. 1135 (1925).",Thomas,0,
2021-004,102,"Despite this long tradition, our more recent cases say it is unsettled whether the proper-presentation requirement is a jurisdictional bar or merely a prudential consideration.

Two cases in the mid-20th century unsettled the doctrine with little justification. First, in Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949), the petitioner raised a First Amendment challenge to a city ordinance in state court, but failed to challenge the jury instruction interpreting that ordinance either below or in this Court. The Court sidestepped the proper-presentation requirement by reading the jury instruction as a construction of the ordinance  as binding on us as though the precise words had been written into the ordinance. Id., at 4, 69 S.Ct. 894. Later, in Vachon v. New Hampshire, 414 U.S. 478, 94 S.Ct. 664, 38 L.Ed.2d 666 (1974) (per curiam), the Court deviated yet further from the jurisdictional understanding of the proper-presentation rule. For the first time, and in an unreasoned footnote, the Court explicitly forgave a petitioner's failure to present a federal claim to the state court. See id., at 479, n. 3, 94 S.Ct. 664. Other than Terminiello, the Court cited three cases that reviewed claims from federal court, see 414 U.S., at 483, 94 S.Ct. 664 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), where the requirement to present a federal claim has never been jurisdictional, see, e.g., Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259, 107 S.Ct. 1114, 94 L.Ed.2d 293 (1987) (per curiam).",Thomas,0,
2021-004,103,"Since Vachon, the Court has not explained why the requirement to present a federal claim in state court is prudential rather than jurisdictional. Instead, we have repeatedly ducked the issue. See Howell, 543 U.S., at 445-446, 125 S.Ct. 856 (collecting cases). I see no reason to prolong this Court's ambivalence. The proper-presentation requirement appears in the only statute that grants this Court jurisdiction to review state-court decisions. For most of our history, that requirement was unfailingly understood to be jurisdictional. And our cases have since departed from this principle without squaring that departure with § 1257's unqualified text. Accordingly, I would hold that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear a federal claim on review from a state court where a petitioner, like Hemphill, fails to properly present his claim to the court below.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,105,"That the Court decides this case despite Hemphill's failure to present his claim to the New York Court of Appeals is not a mere academic defect. Federal nullification of a state statute, or any state rule, is a grave matter. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 135, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986), see also Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 17, 138 S.Ct. 2305, 2324, 201 L.Ed.2d 714 (2018) (the inability to enforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State). And it is unseemly in our dual system of government to disturb the finality of state judgments on a federal ground that the state court did not have occasion to consider. Adams, 520 U.S., at 90, 117 S.Ct. 1028 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, it is important that state courts be given the first opportunity to consider the applicability of state rules, particularly in light of constitutional challenge, since the rules may be construed in a way which saves their constitutionality. Cardinale, 394 U.S., at 439, 89 S.Ct. 1161. A state court's interest in deciding whether to  amend its rules to avoid potential constitutional challenges is undeniable. Adams, 520 U.S., at 90, 117 S.Ct. 1028.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,106,"Today, the Court disregards these important principles of comity. Webb v. Webb, 451 U.S. 493, 499, 101 S.Ct. 1889, 68 L.Ed.2d 392 (1981). In the Court of Appeals, Hemphill argued that state law required  an affirmative attempt to mislead the jury  before the door can be opened to otherwise inadmissible evidence. App. 386. Hemphill maintained that the doctrine is not so capacious as to allow the admission of any evidence made relevant by the opposing party's strategy. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, the Court describes Reid as permitting the prosecution to introduce all evidence that is arguably relevant to rebut the defendant's theory of defense. Ante, at 686-687. The Court thus redefines Reid to be what Hemphill said it was not, and then holds that caricature of Reid unconstitutional without giving the Court of Appeals an opportunity to clarify its evidentiary rule in light of a concrete constitutional challenge. Even if Massie, Reid, and their progeny do not clearly define what it means to mislead a jury, any uncertainty is all the more reason for this Court to refrain from deciding this case prematurely. That the New York courts may clarify their doctrine in a later case does not forgive the Court's impetuosity here.",Thomas,0,
2021-004,107,"The Court's neglect of our settled jurisdictional principles is particularly unfortunate in this case. As Hemphill concedes, New York's Appellate Division does not appear to apply the door-opening doctrine consistently. See Reply Brief 10, n. 4. Some cases hold that Massie and Reid do not permit the prosecution to introduce evidence merely to counter the defendant's theory of the case. People v. Richardson, 95 App.Div.3d 1039, 1040, 943 N.Y.S.2d 599, 600 (2012). Others seem to apply the rule more aggressively. See People v. Cole, 59 App.Div.3d 302, 302-303, 873 N.Y.S.2d 603, 604 (2009). Either way, the Court today purports to resolve what is effectively an intramural disagreement within the New York judiciary in order to reach a novel constitutional claim.

See 28 U.S.C. § 1782 (permitting district courts to order production of testimony or documents for use in a proceeding in a foreign  tribunal). The Government intervened.

The Government argues that the privilege should apply because Zubaydah's discovery request could force former CIA contractors to confirm the location of the detention site and that confirmation would itself significantly harm national security interests.

Section 1782 says that a district court may order a person in its district to provide testimony or documents for use in a proceeding in a foreign  tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.

It did not accept the Government's claim that merely confirming that a detention site was operated in Poland would pose a grave risk to national security. Id., at 59a. But it nonetheless thought the state secrets privilege applied. It concluded that the state secrets privilege allowed the Government to suppress operational details concerning the specifics of cooperation with a foreign government, including the roles and identities of foreign individuals. Id., at 55a-56a (emphasis added). And it believed that it was not possible to conduct meaningful discovery  in this matter without disclosing these (or other) protected types of information. Id., at 57a. The court rejected Zubaydah's suggestion that it would be possible to conduct further discovery through the use of code names that would conceal the locations of CIA detention facilities.

2021-005,54,"Zubaydah appealed. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.

But the panel majority held that the District Court nonetheless should not have dismissed the case. That was because, in its view, the state secrets privilege did not apply to information that was already publicly known. 938 F.3d at 1133. It added that because Mitchell and Jessen are private parties, their disclosures would not tend to show that the Government itself had confirmed or denied anything. Ibid.",Breyer,0,

2021-005,59,"The state secrets privilege permits the Government to prevent disclosure of information when that disclosure would harm national security interests.

2021-005,60,"To assert the privilege, the Government must submit to the court a formal claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 7-8, 73 S.Ct. 528. The court itself must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege. Id., at 8, 73 S.Ct. 528. Judicial control over the evidence in a case cannot be abdicated to the caprice of executive officers. Id., at 9-10, 73 S.Ct. 528. Nonetheless, in assessing the Government's claim that disclosure may harm national security, courts must exercise the traditional reluctance to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs. Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988).",Breyer,0,
2021-005,61,"Although the court itself must assess the sufficiency of the Government's privilege claim, the showing of necessity which is made, by the party seeking disclosure of the ostensibly privileged information, will determine how far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Where there is a strong showing of necessity, the claim of privilege should not be lightly accepted. Ibid. In contrast, where necessity is dubious, a formal claim of privilege, demonstrating a reasonable possibility of harm to national security, will have to prevail. Ibid. And in all events, even the most compelling necessity cannot overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,62,"Justice GORSUCH agrees that the Government must show a reasonable danger of harm to national security, that a court must decide for itself whether the occasion is appropriate for claiming the privilege, and that in camera review is not always required to make that determination. Post, at 994-995 (dissenting opinion). We diverge from the dissent on how those principles should apply to the specific discovery requests Zubaydah has made in this litigation. Of course, our answer to that question is not a judgment of Zubaydah's alleged terrorist activities, nor of his treatment at the hands of the United States Government. Obviously the Court condones neither terrorism nor torture, but in this case we are required to decide only a narrow evidentiary dispute.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,64,"An important factor in our analysis of that narrow issue is the specific language of Zubaydah's discovery requests and the Ninth Circuit's opinion, which both make it clear that any response Mitchell and Jessen give to Zubaydah's subpoenas would tend to confirm (or deny) the existence of a CIA detention site in Poland. As we have said, 12 of Zubaydah's 13 document requests contain the word Poland or Polish. Appendix, infra, at 972-973. (The exception is a broad request for any and all documents concerning Zubaydah himself. Ibid.) Ten of the requests specifically seek documents, correspondence, or memoranda  concerning the alleged CIA detention site in Stare Kiejkuty, Poland. Ibid. If Mitchell and Jessen acknowledge the existence of documents responsive to these requests, they will effectively acknowledge the existence of the detention facility referenced therein. Conversely, denying the existence of responsive documents would deny the existence of such a facility. In any event, any response to the lion's share of Zubaydah's document requests will either confirm or deny that the CIA operated a detention site in Poland.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,65,"The problem is confirmed by the Ninth Circuit's opinion, which allowed continued discovery into three topics: the existence of a CIA detention facility in Poland, the conditions of confinement and interrogation at that facility, and Zubaydah's treatment at that location. 938 F.3d at 1134. The first category, of course, requires Mitchell and Jessen to directly confirm or deny the existence of a Polish detention site. The latter two categories require, at the very least, confirmation or denial, since acknowledging that any confinement, interrogation, or treatment occurred at a CIA detention facility located in Poland would confirm that such a facility exists or existed.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,66,"Because any response to Zubaydah's subpoenas allowed by the Ninth Circuit's decision will have the effect of confirmation or denial (by the Government or its former contractors) of the existence of a CIA facility in Poland, the primary question for us must be whether the existence (or non-existence) of a CIA detention facility in Poland falls within the scope of the state secrets privilege. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,68,"We agree with the Government that sometimes information that has entered the public domain may nonetheless fall within the scope of the state secrets privilege. But see 938 F.3d, at 1133 (In order to be a `state secret,' a fact must first be a `secret'). The Government here has provided a reasonable explanation of why Mitchell and Jessen's confirmation or denial of the information Zubaydah seeks could significantly harm national security interests, even if that information has already been made public through unofficial sources.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,69,"The CIA Director stated in his declaration that the Agency's counterterrorism efforts rely on clandestine relationships with foreign intelligence services. App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a-131a. The Director explained that foreign intelligence services are a critical intelligence source, whose help is vital to our world-wide efforts to collect intelligence and thwart terrorist attacks. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,70,"He further explained that these sensitive relationships with other nations are based on mutual trust that the classified existence and nature of the relationship will not be disclosed. Id., at 135a-136a. To confirm the existence of such a relationship would breach that trust and have serious negative consequences, including jeopardizing relationships with other foreign  intelligence or security services. Id., at 131a-132a. In light of these concerns, the CIA has steadfastly refused to confirm or deny the accuracy of public speculation about its cooperation with Poland, leaving an important element of doubt about the veracity of that speculation, providing an additional layer of confidentiality, and at least confirming that the United States will stand firm in safeguarding any coordinated clandestine activities, despite the passage of time, the existence of media reports, and changes in public opinion. Id., at 133a-136a. In a word, to confirm publicly the existence of a CIA site in Country A, can diminish the extent to which the intelligence services of Countries A, B, C, D, etc., will prove willing to cooperate with our own intelligence services in the future.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,71,"Justice GORSUCH believes that the Government has failed to meet its burden of showing that a `reasonable danger' of harm to national security would follow from sharing the information sought. Post, at 997. In his view, the Director's declaration is insufficient to demonstrate that requiring the government to acknowledge that the CIA did or did not operate a detention facility in Poland in the early 2000s would invite a reasonable danger of additional harm to national security. Post, at 997. We disagree. It stands to reason that a former CIA insider's confirmation of confidential cooperation between the CIA and a foreign intelligence service could damage the CIA's clandestine relationships with foreign authorities. Confirmation by such an insider is different in kind from speculation in the press or even by foreign courts because it leaves virtually no doubt as to the veracity of the information that has been confirmed. And there is ample reason to think that the circumstances of this case—particularly the specific discovery requests at issue here—could lead to this kind of confirmation. In any event, the CIA's refusal to confirm or deny its cooperation with foreign intelligence services plays an important role in and of itself in maintaining the trust upon which those relationships are based.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,72,"Nor, as Justice GORSUCH believes, do we reach this conclusion by incorrectly placing the burden on Zubaydah to disprove the Government's assertion of harm. Post, at 997-998. To the contrary, we agree with Justice GORSUCH that the Government bears the burden of showing that the privilege should apply—we simply disagree with his conclusion that it failed to meet that burden here. In our view, the Director's declaration adequately establishes that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence at issue will expose  matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. And we have found nothing in the evidentiary record that casts doubt on our conclusion that the Government has met its burden here. Reynolds itself contemplated that a similar basis for a claim of privilege could prevail without further examination by the court of the ostensibly privileged evidence. Id., at 9-11, 73 S.Ct. 528.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,73,"In contrast, Justice THOMAS, referring to Reynolds, believes that we need not consider the Government's justifications for invoking the privilege at all because Zubaydah has not made a `strong showing of necessity' for the requested information. Post, at 973-974 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Reynolds, however, taken as an example, indicates that the Government initially must formally invoke the privilege. 345 U.S., at 8, 73 S.Ct. 528. Then the court itself must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of  privilege. Ibid. And only after satisfying itself that the Government has offered a valid reason for invoking the privilege would a court turn to the issue of necessity (a matter that would help the court determine how deeply to probe the details of, and basis for, the Government's privilege claim). Id., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528. We follow Reynolds' example here.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,75,"Additionally, the Government cites legal authority from the separate but roughly analogous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) context, which supports our conclusion that the CIA's concerns warrant application of the state secrets privilege. Brief for Petitioner 32-34. The FOIA contains exemptions that permit an agency to withhold Government records that a member of the public has requested and which the agency would otherwise have to disclose. 5 U.S.C. § 552. But the exemptions do not apply (and the agency must make the information available) if the information has already become public, provided that it has been officially acknowledged by the agency from which the information is sought. Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (C.A.D.C. 1990) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals held that, under the circumstances present in Fitzgibbon, if there has been official acknowledgment then the agency must disclose the information despite the exemption. Ibid. If the agency has not officially acknowledged the information, however, then it may withhold the information (under an applicable exemption) despite the fact that the information has become public. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,76,"To be clear, the FOIA doctrine is only an (imperfect) analogy, and nothing in this opinion should be taken to suggest that the waiver standards in that area apply directly to the state secrets privilege. However, the principles underlying the FOIA rule provide at least some support for the Government's position here. Lower courts have explained that the official acknowledgement doctrine recognizes the reality that official confirmation of sensitive information may pose risks that unofficial disclosure does not. It is one thing for a reporter or author to speculate or guess that a thing may be so or even, quoting undisclosed sources, to say that it is so, it is quite another thing for one in a position to know of it officially to say that it is so. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. v. Colby, 509 F.2d 1362, 1370 (C.A.4 1975). Official confirmation may dispel lingering doubts or reveal that the information currently in the public domain is incomplete or itself a cover story. Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 744-745 (C.A.D.C. 1981).",Breyer,0,
2021-005,77,"This logic helps to explain why disclosure by Mitchell and Jessen could be harmful in ways that disclosure by other sources would not. Here, the Government has not confirmed or otherwise officially acknowledged the existence of a CIA detention site in Poland and it has explained why, under these circumstances, confirmation of that information could reasonably be expected to significantly harm national security interests. That is sufficient to demonstrate that the occasion for the privilege is appropriate. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. (The Polish government has also never confirmed whether it cooperated with the CIA, so we need not decide in this case what significance, if any, that disclosure would have.)",Breyer,0,
2021-005,79,"The Court of Appeals also believed that, because Mitchell and Jessen are private parties, their disclosures were not equivalent to the United States confirming or denying anything. 938 F.3d at 1133. We do not agree with this conclusion.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,80,"Mitchell and Jessen worked directly for the CIA as contractors. Zubaydah contends (without contradiction) that Mitchell and Jessen devised and implemented the CIA's enhanced-interrogation program and that they personally interrogated Zubaydah. Brief for Respondents 1-2. Given Mitchell and Jessen's central role in the relevant events, we believe that their confirmation (or denial) of the information Zubaydah seeks would be tantamount to a disclosure from the CIA itself. Indeed, the CIA Director's Declaration describes the harm that would result from Mitchell and Jessen responding to the subpoenas, not the risks of a response from the CIA (or any other CIA official or employee).",Breyer,0,
2021-005,82,"At the same time, Zubaydah's need is not great. At oral argument Zubaydah suggested that he did not seek confirmation of the detention site's Polish location so much as he sought information about what had happened there. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44 (We know where Abu Zubaydah was. We want to establish how he was treated there).",Breyer,0,
2021-005,84,"For these reasons, we conclude that in this case the state secrets privilege applies to the existence (or nonexistence) of a CIA facility in Poland. It therefore precludes further discovery into all three categories of information the Ninth Circuit concluded to be nonprivileged because, as we have explained, such discovery will inevitably confirm or deny the existence of such a facility. See supra, at 967-968.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,86,"While Justice KAGAN and Justice GORSUCH would send the case back for additional proceedings, we believe that it must be dismissed. Although application of the state secrets privilege does not always require dismissal, we are unpersuaded that the litigation at issue here, founded upon the specific document requests set forth in the Appendix, infra, at 972-973, can survive the Government's successful privilege claim.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,87,"Justice GORSUCH first suggests that we should remand for the District Court to conduct in camera review of any evidence the government might wish to present to substantiate its privilege claim. Post, at 998. It is true that sometimes a court must personally review the evidence at issue in order to assess the Government's assertion of the state secrets privilege. See Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. However, additional judicial probing is inappropriate here for two reasons taken together. First, for the reasons explained above, the CIA Director's affidavit, together with the lack of contrary evidence, is sufficient to satisfy us  that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the privileged evidence will expose  matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged. Ibid. Second, the necessity of additional judicial probing depends, as we have explained, on Zubaydah's need for the information he seeks. We have explained that much of that information is already publicly available from other sources. Supra, at 964-965. The public availability of information concerning Zubaydah's treatment diminishes his need for the discovery he seeks from Mitchell and Jessen, and thus for further judicial probing of the Government's privilege claim. See Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528 (necessity is greatly minimized by an available alternative). Zubaydah's need for information about his treatment may be further diminished by the Government's representation that (subject to a security review) it will allow Zubaydah to send a declaration that could be transmitted to  Polish prosecutors. Letter from B. Fletcher, Acting Solicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court 3 (Oct. 15, 2021). And, as we just said, Zubaydah's counsel stated at oral argument: We know where Abu Zubaydah was. We want to establish how he was treated there. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,88,"Alternatively, both Justice KAGAN and Justice GORSUCH suggest that even if the existence or nonexistence of a detention site in Poland really does qualify as a state secret, we should nonetheless remand so that discovery may continue on a different topic: Zubaydah's treatment from December 2002 through September 2003 and without reference to geography. Post, at 998 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting), see also post, at 983-985 (KAGAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In their view, familiar judicial tools, such as protective orders and code names, would be adequate to protect against the possibility of an inadvertent disclosure of privileged information. Post, at 998-999 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.), see also post, at 984-985 (opinion of KAGAN, J.).",Breyer,0,
2021-005,89,"Unfortunately, this suggestion ignores the nature of the specific discovery requests at issue here. It may well be that such techniques have successfully prevented the disclosure of classified information in previous litigation on related subject matter. See post, at 998-999 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (describing protective measures used to prevent disclosure of classified information in United States v. Khalid Shaikh Mohammad and Salim v. Mitchell, No. 2:15-cv-286 (ED Wash.)). But the nature of this case (an exclusively discovery-related proceeding aimed at producing evidence for use by Polish criminal investigators) and the specific discovery requests before us convince us that these techniques would not be effective here. In particular, as we have already explained, both the subpoena's language and the Ninth Circuit's decision are such that any response to Zubaydah's discovery requests would inevitably tend to confirm or deny whether the CIA operated a detention site located in Poland. Supra, at 967. All this is true regardless of protective measures that might be employed by the courts below. Of course, we need not and do not here decide whether a different discovery request filed by Zubaydah might avoid the problems that preclude further litigation regarding the requests at issue here.",Breyer,0,
2021-005,90,"Finally, Justice GORSUCH ignores the nature of this litigation. This case arises from Zubaydah's ex parte application for discovery under § 1782. It is a purely evidentiary proceeding and thus unlike most litigation, which may, after a successful assertion of the state secrets privilege, continue without the government's privileged proof. Post, at 998. Here, the privilege blocks Zubaydah's discovery requests, which are the proceeding's sole object. Given that fact, we can see no reason to remand for further proceedings.",Breyer,0,

The United States now moves to quash Zubaydah's § 1782 application by invoking the state-secrets privilege, citing national-security interests.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,120,"In Reynolds, this Court held that the Government may invoke the state-secrets privilege whenever there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged. 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. Upon the Government's formal claim of privilege, the court itself must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege, and yet do so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect. Id., at 7-8, 73 S.Ct. 528 (footnote omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-005,121,"Reynolds prescribed a two-step framework instructing courts how far they should probe in satisfying themselves that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate. Id., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. First, courts must assess the requesting party's need for the Government's privileged material. If the party's need is dubious, a formal claim of privilege will have to prevail without judicial inquiry into the basis for the Government's claim. Ibid. A party has a dubious need unless it can show that the proposed discovery is immediately and essentially applicable to the party's case. United States v. Burr, 25 F.Cas. 30, 37 (C.C. Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.). For example, a dubious showing of necessity arises if a party has an available alternative to privileged material that might give him the evidence to make out his case without forcing a showdown on the claim of privilege. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Likewise, a party's need is dubious if it is possible  to adduce the essential facts without resort to material touching upon military secrets. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,122,"Second, if a party has made a strong showing of necessity, immediate dismissal of the discovery request is not required. Ibid. The court may then ask whether there is a reasonable danger that military secrets are at stake. Id., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528. When answering that question, in camera review is not automatic, id., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, but rather a last resort, Larson v. Department of State, 565 F.3d 857, 870 (C.A.D.C. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). And, in all cases, the court must afford the utmost deference to the Executive's assessment of national-security threats. Egan, 484 U.S., at 530, 108 S.Ct. 818 (internal quotation marks omitted).1 Such deference is  required because it is the responsibility of the Executive, not that of the judiciary, to weigh the variety of complex and subtle factors in determining whether disclosure of information may lead to an unacceptable risk of compromising the Nation's safety. CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 180, 105 S.Ct. 1881, 85 L.Ed.2d 173 (1985). Ultimately, if the court is satisfied that military secrets are at stake, even the most compelling necessity cannot overcome the claim of privilege. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528, see also Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2412, 2438-2439, 207 L.Ed.2d 907 (2020) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).",Thomas,0,
2021-005,123,"Reynolds itself involved only a dubious need for privileged material. The plaintiffs were widows of three civilians who died when a military flight testing secret electronic equipment crashed. 345 U.S., at 3, 73 S.Ct. 528. The plaintiffs filed suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346 et seq., and the Government invoked the state-secrets privilege to withhold the Air Force's accident investigation report and related materials. See 345 U.S., at 3-4, 73 S.Ct. 528. The Court sustained the privilege because the plaintiffs posed the privilege question for decision with the formal claim of privilege set against a dubious showing of necessity. Id., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Specifically, the plaintiffs had adduced nothing to suggest that the electronic equipment  had any causal connection with the accident, making discovery into the equipment unnecessary. Ibid. The Government also had offered to make the surviving crew members available for examination, but the plaintiffs declined that invitation. Ibid. For these reasons, and not because the Court independently assessed whether military secrets were at stake, ibid., the Court found the plaintiffs' need dubious and ordered the dismissal of their discovery request.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,125,"In this case, the Court inverts the Reynolds test so that courts first ask whether the Government has offered a valid reason for invoking the privilege, and then ask whether the requesting party has demonstrated sufficient need for the discovery. Ante, at 969-970. Now, a court turns to the issue of necessity not to determine whether to evaluate the Government's reasons for invoking the state-secrets privilege, but rather to ascertain how deeply to probe the details of, and basis for, the Government's privilege claim. Ante, at 970.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,126,"Reynolds squarely forecloses the Court's reasons-first approach. Regardless of need, a claim of privilege must prevail once the Government has given a valid reason to support it, because even the most compelling necessity cannot overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. The Court offers no explanation how a court might discern a valid reason to invoke the state-secrets privilege without also being satisfied that state secrets are in issue. Here, to determine whether the Government has offered a valid reason, the Court even searched the evidentiary record to ensure that nothing  casts  doubt on its conclusion. Ante, at 969. Thus, to start by evaluating the Government's reasons for privilege, as the Court does, leaves Reynolds' analysis of need with no role to play. That result is flatly inconsistent with Reynolds, where the Court did not evaluate the Government's reasons to support its privilege claim, but instead ordered dismissal of the discovery request in light of the plaintiffs' dubious showing of necessity. 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. In upending Reynolds' test, the Court fails to grapple with or even discuss Reynolds' analysis.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,127,"Unfortunately, by invoking need as Reynolds' second step, with a cryptic instruction to probe the Government's reasons yet more deeply, ante, at 970, the Court twice puts the Nation's security at risk. First, any judicial inquiry more searching than the Court's analysis here likely will lead to in camera review whenever the requesting party demonstrates adequate need. Because the Court already dissects the CIA Director's declaration, see ante, at 968-969, it is unclear how else the Government could support its privilege claim other than by disclosing evidence in camera. But making in camera review turn on the party's need improperly prescribes automatic  disclosure to the judge in the narrow but important class of cases for which the moving party demonstrates adequate need. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. Such an approach also ignores that examination of the evidence  by the judge alone jeopardizes the security which the privilege is meant to protect. Ibid. While the Executive can control its subordinates' access to state secrets and enforce penalties if such material is mishandled, it has little control once state secrets fall into the Judiciary's hands. Disclosure to a judge, therefore, poses a very real national-security threat. The plurality's cavalier statement that sometimes in camera review is warranted fails even to acknowledge that risk. Ante, at 971.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,128,"Second, the Court's inverted Reynolds test undermines the utmost deference owed to the Executive's national-security judgments. Egan, 484 U.S., at 530, 108 S.Ct. 818 (internal quotation marks omitted). While the Court purports to apply that standard in this case, see ante, at 967, it then instructs courts to probe more deeply the basis for  the Government's privilege claim when need is established, ante, at 970. This will inevitably result in judicial second-guessing of core national-security determinations, defeating the unity, secrecy, and dispatch that the Founders believed to be so important to the Executive Branch. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 592, 124 S.Ct. 2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), see also The Federalist No. 64, pp. 392-393 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (because perfect secrecy is sometimes requisite in international affairs, the President must be able to manage the business of intelligence in such manner as prudence may suggest).",Thomas,0,
2021-005,130,"Justice KAVANAUGH joins the Court's opinion but would reframe its test. Rather than invert Reynolds' two-step approach, he maintains that the Government's assertion of privilege should prompt a threshold judicial inquiry in which a court asks whether the `circumstances indicate a reasonable possibility' that state secrets are involved. Post, at 982 (opinion concurring in part) (quoting Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528). Justice KAVANAUGH fails to describe what this analysis entails, other than to characterize it as not demanding and the result as typically self-evident. Post, at 982-983. But his Reynolds step 0 cannot be meaningfully different from the Court's upfront demand for  reason giving. He concedes that this is a case of `dubious' need, post, at 982-983 (quoting Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528), so he cannot think that the Court properly applies Reynolds' second step. He also joins the Court's analysis in relevant part, which indicates that his threshold judicial inquiry includes both the Court's searching evaluation of the CIA Director's declaration and its review of the record to ensure that nothing casts doubt on the Director's explanation. See ante, at 969 970 (majority opinion). In short, Justice KAVANAUGH's tripartite test must likewise require plenary (though deferential) review at the threshold, with more exacting review (sometimes including in camera review) as the party's need grows.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,131,"To be sure, Reynolds acknowledged that the Government raised the state-secrets privilege under circumstances indicating a reasonable possibility that military secrets were involved. 345 U.S., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Justice KAVANAUGH relies on that language to create Reynolds step 0. See post, at 982-983 (opinion concurring in part). But Reynolds did not envision the threshold reason-giving requirement that Justice KAVANAUGH proposes and the Court now applies. Instead, in discussing the circumstances, Reynolds merely characterized the facts of the case: There was a reasonable possibility that military secrets were involved because the case involved a military plane which had gone aloft to test secret electronic equipment. 345 U.S., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528. It did not require a threshold judicial inquiry to make that observation. Nor does it require any meaningful inquiry to observe that this case involves an alleged clandestine detention site. Again, Reynolds' only threshold inquiry was to assess the plaintiffs' need for the Government's privileged material. That is why the Court decided that the Government's claim of privilege cut off further demand for the documents on the showing of necessity without assessing the validity of the Government's reasons. Id., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. The Court and Justice KAVANAUGH's reasons-first, need-later approach has no basis in our case law.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,133,"Finally, Justice GORSUCH would dispense with Reynolds and instruct judges to evaluate de novo the Government's invocation of the state-secrets privilege. He does not say de novo, but his analysis makes the point clear. He summarily dismisses the CIA Director's 15-page declaration as a conclusory assertion, post, at 997-998 (dissenting opinion), proposes that courts often should review state secrets in camera, post, at 994-995, and then suggests that courts independently evaluate that privileged information, post, at 993. This approach finds no support in Reynolds, Egan, or related cases, see Part II-A, supra, as Justice GORSUCH effectively concedes. He rejects Egan, see, e.g., post, at 994, and he criticizes Reynolds for accepting the Government's claim of privilege at face value without even pausing to review the privileged information, post, at 993. True, quoting Reynolds, Justice GORSUCH indicates that courts should ask whether discovery would present a `reasonable danger' to national security. Post, at 994 (quoting 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528). But the question remains: in whose judgment? His answer is clear: our independent judgment. Post, at 994.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,134,"Justice GORSUCH offers three arguments to support de novo judicial review of a state-secrets claim, none of which has merit. First, he asserts that courts generally must respect  the ancient rule that the public enjoys a right to `every man's evidence.' Post, at 991 (quoting 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law § 2192, p. 2965 (1905)). But whatever right there may be to civil discovery  generally,2 there is no right to state secrets specifically. As Wigmore explained, when any of the various privileges applies, the obligation to produce evidence is not insisted upon. Id., at 2967. The state-secrets privilege, of course, is a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 6-7, 73 S.Ct. 528, see also Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 23 L.Ed. 605 (1876), Burr, 25 F.Cas. at 37. Thus, to assert a right to discovery proves nothing, because the formal claim of the state-secrets privilege overrides it here.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,135,"Second, Justice GORSUCH posits that because Congress has expressly authorized the Judiciary to entertain this suit by enacting § 1782, it follows that we may not reflexively defer to the Executive's wish to see it dismissed. Post, at 991, n. 10. But that argument omits an important caveat found in the same provision on which Justice GORSUCH relies. Ibid. Section 1782(a) provides: A person may not be compelled to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing in violation of any legally applicable privilege. Thus, far from inviting de novo review, Congress instructed federal courts to apply all privileges—including the state-secrets privilege—with full force. Invoking § 1782 merely presents anew the question in this case: what does the state-secrets privilege require.3",Thomas,0,
2021-005,136,"Third, Justice GORSUCH invokes Chief Justice Marshall's two opinions in the Burr prosecution, but both cut decisively against him. In 1807, the Federal Government prosecuted Aaron Burr, the former Vice President, for treason and, later, misdemeanor incitement. Vance, 591 U. S., at ___, ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2421, 2423. Burr moved for a subpoena duces tecum ordering President Jefferson to produce a letter from General James Wilkinson, Burr's principal accuser. Id., at ___-___, 140 S.Ct., at 2421-2422. Chief Justice Marshall explained that it did not  appear to the court that the the president did object to the production of any part of Wilkinson's letter. United States v. Burr, 25 F.Cas. 187, 192 (C.C. Va. 1807), see also Burr, 25 F.Cas. at 31, 37. But had the president done so and subjected the letter to certain restrictions, and stated that in his judgment the public interest required certain parts of it to be kept secret, Chief Justice Marshall assured that all proper respect would have been paid to the President's invocation of privilege. Burr, 25 F.Cas. at 192.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,137,"Justice GORSUCH nonetheless reasons that it would not have been enough, to defeat the subpoena, for President Jefferson to have objected on state-secrets grounds. Chief Justice Marshall supposedly would have required the President to `state the particular reasons' for withholding  the Wilkinson letter, and the court then could have decided for itself whether to sustain a claim of privilege. Post, at 991 (quoting Burr, 25 F.Cas. at 192). Justice GORSUCH's argument by selective quotation is incorrect. Chief Justice Marshall explained that on objections being made by the president to the production of a paper, the court would not proceed further in the case without such an affidavit as would clearly show the paper to be essential to the justice of the case. Id., at 192 (emphasis added), see also Burr, 25 F.Cas. at 37 (If it does contain any matter which  it is not the wish of the executive to disclose, such matter, if it be not immediately and essentially applicable to the point, will, of course, be suppressed). That analysis tracks Reynolds' first step: The Government invokes the state-secrets privilege, and the privilege will prevail unless the requesting party makes the requisite showing of need. Thus, Justice GORSUCH is simply incorrect that Chief Justice Marshall nowhere suggested that the state secrets privilege should apply in this country without  a statement of reasons to support the privilege. Post, at 992, n. 11.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,138,"Justice GORSUCH further errs in asserting that a reviewing court must demand a statement of reasons and then decide for itself whether those reasons are adequate. Post, at 991-992. Quite the opposite: Chief Justice Marshall explained that the president may, not must, state the particular reasons for his claim of privilege, and that the court will unquestionably allow  full force to those reasons, 25 F.Cas., at 192 (emphasis added), not decide for itself whether they pass muster, post, at 991-992. That analysis follows Reynolds' second step: If there is adequate need, the Government may explain the basis for privilege and the court affords utmost deference or full force to those reasons. The reality of Burr, then, is the opposite of what Justice GORSUCH proposes.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,139,"Ultimately, Justice GORSUCH's animating concern is that judicial deference to the Executive's national-security judgments risks collapsing the many points of difference between our Chief Executive and the 18th-century British monarch. Burr, 25 F.Cas., at 34. Not so. This Court's standard of utmost deference bears little relation to the privilege the English crown enjoyed. Post, at 992. In contrasting the American Executive and the British monarch, Chief Justice Marshall explained that only a king could not be made to appear under the process of the court, and therefore he alone could object even to the issuance of a subpoena. Burr, 25 F.Cas., at 34. The President, meanwhile, must move to quash a subpoena rather than object to its being issued, and then he may invoke the law of evidence as grounds for not obeying the process of the court. Ibid. That is precisely how the Executive Branch proceeded here. After the District Court first granted Zubaydah's discovery application, the Government moved to quash it in light of the state-secrets privilege. See ante, at 965-966. To eviscerate that privilege, as Justice GORSUCH proposes, would not protect the Nation from monarchy. Rather, it would contravene the constitutional directive that the Executive has primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 34, 135 S.Ct. 2076, 192 L.Ed.2d 83 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-005,141,"While the Court recognizes that Zubaydah's need for discovery from Mitchell and Jessen is not great, ante, at 971, see also  ante, at 971-972 (plurality opinion), it refuses to dismiss Zubaydah's discovery application in light of his dubious showing of necessity, Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Instead, as explained above, the Court begins at Reynolds' second step and concludes that the Government has provided a reasonable explanation why Zubaydah's proposed discovery could significantly harm national security interests. Ante, at 968.4 I agree that the Government has offered, at the very least, a reasonable explanation to support its claim of state secrets, but I would dismiss Zubaydah's discovery application at Reynolds' first step.5 For at least three reasons, Zubaydah has failed to prove any nontrivial need for his requested discovery.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,142,"First, Zubaydah will not use the requested discovery in a case that can offer him any meaningful relief. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 9, 73 S.Ct. 528. While even the plaintiffs in Reynolds sought to exercise a federal right that potentially entitled them to damages, Zubaydah, by contrast, does not assert any federal right to relief. He does not allege, for example, that the proposed discovery would support his release from federal custody. Nor could he, as the sought discovery will be shipped overseas for the benefit of another country's judicial system, and at that point, totally out of control of a domestic court. 965 F.3d, at 792 (opinion of BRESS, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, Zubaydah requests discovery on behalf of foreign authorities to help them prosecute foreign nationals who allegedly committed crimes in a foreign country. At least for purposes of the state-secrets privilege, Zubaydah has no cognizable need to serve as a conduit for foreign discovery. This Court has never held that an individual's desire to litigate a foreign case, let alone his desire merely to assist in the litigation of someone else's foreign case, establishes any need under Reynolds, dubious or otherwise.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,143,"Second, Zubaydah has failed to pursue an available alternative that might have given him the evidence to make out his case without forcing a showdown on the claim of privilege. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Before this Court, Zubaydah recognizes that his testimony as an alleged survivor of CIA interrogation could substitute for discovery from Mitchell and Jessen. Brief for Respondents 40. After all, what the Polish authorities supposedly need to know is what happened inside Abu Zubaydah's cell between December 2002 and September 2003. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. While Zubaydah complains that the Government holds him incommunicado, he also admits that his attorneys may communicate on his behalf with the Government's pre-clearance. Brief for Respondents 40. At oral argument, the Government confirmed that Zubaydah has never asked to offer testimony under this preclearance procedure, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 73, and the Government has since confirmed that the preclearance procedure  remains available, see Letter Brief for United States 3. Faced with that confirmation, Zubaydah now concedes that it is at least theoretically possible that the preclearance process will lead to a declaration that can assist the Polish prosecutor. Letter Brief for Respondents 2. He even asks that we hold his case in abeyance until he can prepare a declaration. See ibid. But that request comes too late. Zubaydah's failure to pursue an available alternative before demanding state secrets betrays a dubious showing of necessity that cannot overcome the Government's formal claim of privilege. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528.",Thomas,0,
2021-005,144,"Third, on Zubaydah's own telling, it is possible  to adduce the essential facts without resort to material touching upon military secrets. Ibid. At oral argument, Zubaydah's counsel clarified that Zubaydah does not need evidence about Poland specifically and seeks discovery only regarding the conditions of his confinement while in CIA custody. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Of course, that discovery would still tend to confirm or deny the existence of a detention site in Poland. See ante, at 972 (plurality opinion). But, regardless, discovery is not warranted because Zubaydah effectively disclaims any need for such evidence. In his brief, Zubaydah claims already to have abundant evidence of his detention and torture on Polish soil. Brief for Respondents 11. Similarly, at argument, Zubaydah's counsel represented that Polish authorities have interviewed 62 people and amassed 43 volumes of documents. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. His counsel further explained: We're simply trying to supplement information the Polish prosecutor already has. Id., at 66. In light of these admissions, it is clear that Zubaydah has already adduced the essential facts that he believes are necessary to support the Polish prosecution.

2021-005,148,"For the state secrets privilege to apply, the relevant government agency head must first assert the privilege. The court must then determine that the circumstances indicate a reasonable possibility that state secrets are involved. Id., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. That threshold judicial inquiry is not demanding because, as our precedent and this case illustrate, those circumstances are typically self-evident when the Executive Branch asserts the state secrets privilege. See, e.g., id., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 106-107, 23 L.Ed. 605 (1876).",Kavanaugh,0,

Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. In many state secrets disputes, the case ends there—again, this case proves the point. See Part III, ante. If the requester has demonstrated a strong need for the information, the court may under certain circumstances review the requested documents in camera to confirm that the information falls within the privilege. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528-11. To be clear, however, even if the requester has a strong need, a court should nonetheless not demand to examine the evidence—even alone, in chambers—if the Government can satisfy the court, from all the circumstances of the case, that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged. Id., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, see also id., at 11, n. 26, 73 S.Ct. 528 (noting that in Totten, the action was dismissed on the pleadings because it was so obvious that the very subject matter of the action, a contract to perform espionage, was a matter of state secret).",Kavanaugh,0,

2021-005,153,"Justice KAGAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.",Kagan,0,
2021-005,154,"Both sides have substantial interests in this case—the Government in safeguarding its relationships with foreign intelligence partners, Abu Zubaydah in obtaining information needed to right past wrongs. Sometimes, interests of that kind are wholly irreconcilable, and the state secrets privilege may then put an end to the suit. But that is not so here. The Government's national-security concerns all relate to confirming the location of detention sites. Zubaydah requests evidence of a broader scope, concerning not just where he was detained, but also what happened there. The District Court, using established methods, can segregate the two kinds of evidence—protecting classified information about location while giving Zubaydah access to unclassified information about detention conditions and interrogation methods. I would remand the case to allow that process to go forward. So although I join the Court in much of its analysis, I respectfully dissent from its decision to dismiss this suit.",Kagan,0,
2021-005,155,"Start with where I join the Court: I agree the Government has met its burden of showing that testimony by former CIA contractors confirming the location of Zubaydah's detention would pose a reasonable danger of harm to national security. United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, 97 L.Ed. 727 (1953), see ante, at 968-971. That is true for two reasons. First, testimony of that kind would remove whatever element of doubt exists about the accuracy of public reporting on the  detention site's location, potentially undermining other CIA activities in that country. App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a (Decl. of Michael Pompeo, Director, CIA). Second (and possibly more important here), official confirmation would conflict with commitments the Government has made to foreign intelligence services to never disclose clandestine relationships—even as time passes and new political parties or officials come to power or media leaks occur. Id., at 136a. Standing by those commitments, the Government credibly states, is critical to preserving current intelligence partnerships and establishing new ones. Id., at 132a, see id., at 136a, ante, at 968-970. Those concerns explain why the Government has refused, across three Presidential administrations, to confirm or deny reports about the foreign countries involved in the CIA's former detention and interrogation program. App. to Pet. for Cert. 133a, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. The Court is right to respect that decision, and thus to deny Zubaydah's request for the location of his detention.",Kagan,0,
2021-005,156,"But that does not mean, as the Court insists, that we should dismiss Zubaydah's suit. From the beginning of this litigation, Zubaydah has distinguished between the where and the what—the location of the detention site at issue and the treatment he received there. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a (District Court Order). And in this Court, his attorney made clear that Zubaydah's primary interest is in obtaining information on the latter subject. He wants the CIA contractors to testify about what happened inside his cell during a particular 10-month period, irrespective of where that cell may have been. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, see ibid. (I'm not planning to ask did it happen in Poland . I want to ask simple questions like, how was Abu Zubaydah fed? What was his medical condition? What was his cell like? And, yes, was he tortured?). For its part, the Government concedes that information about Zubaydah's treatment is no longer classified: It is, on any understanding, not a state secret. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6 (explaining that the Government in 2014 decided to declassify information about the treatment of detainees like Zubaydah to facilitate public scrutiny of the United States' actions). That creates the possibility of segregating the classified (location) information from the unclassified (treatment) information and allowing discovery into the latter.",Kagan,0,
2021-005,157,"That kind of segregation has happened before, showing what could be done in this case. In 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a nearly 700-page Report, describing the CIA's torture of various detainees—all while using code words like Detention Site Green and Detention Site Blue to designate particular facilities. See S. Rep. No. 113-288 (2014) (Senate Report). More recently, the CIA permitted its former contractors to testify, in civil litigation and Military Commission hearings, about their use of enhanced interrogation techniques on detainees—again without disclosing any locations. See, e.g., Stipulation Regarding Discovery in Salim v. Mitchell, No. 2:15-cv-286 (ED Wash.), ECF Doc. 47, pp. 5, 7-8. Both the Senate Report and the contractors' testimony discuss Zubaydah, explaining how he was tortured at the first facility he was brought to (whose location has also been identified in public reporting). See, e.g., Senate Report, at 17-48, 231, n. 1316 (describing, among other interrogation methods, more than 80 waterboardings), see also post, at 987-988 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). But neither source details what happened to Zubaydah at the site here in question, the second facility at which he was detained. What Zubaydah now mainly wants is to fill that gap. He is requesting the same  information about the second facility as he already has about the first: the contractors' testimony about the treatment he received there, scrubbed of any reference to where it occurred. So the procedures that worked before—to protect the classified while disclosing the unclassified—can work again. And this case can go forward on that basis.",Kagan,0,
2021-005,158,"The Court offers no satisfactory explanation for rejecting that approach. It says that segregation cannot succeed because of the specific language of Zubaydah's discovery requests—twelve of which contain the word `Poland' or `Polish.' Ante, at 967-968, see ante, at 971-972. That is fair enough, so far as it goes: Responses to the requests as currently written would, as the Court says, either confirm or deny that Poland hosted a CIA-operated detention site. Ante, at 967-968. But a problem of phrasing can be solved by rephrasing. Zubaydah has long made clear—not just in this Court but also below—that he would modify his requests if that would make a difference. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-44, 49-50, App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. All that now needs to happen is for this Court to say that it would. Then Zubaydah would excise any country name from his discovery requests, and the contractors would answer those requests as they previously have done—by describing his treatment at a detention site, without divulging where that site was. Even the Court admits that possibility, though in a backhanded way. The Court says it does not here decide whether Zubaydah could obtain location-cleansed testimony by filing a new suit containing narrowed discovery requests. Ante, at 972. But the question of segregation can be decided now, and in this suit, rather than by sending Zubaydah back to square one. See also post, at 1000-1001 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). I would allow Zubaydah to amend his requests to remove all Poland-specific references, so that he can obtain testimony about his detention —in whatever country it took place.",Kagan,0,
2021-005,159,"In short, the holding that national-security risks attach to confirming the location of Zubaydah's detention—with which I agree—should not end this case. A court can segregate that classified information from unclassified material about the nature of Zubaydah's detention. I would remand the case for that to occur, thus protecting not only the United States's security interests but also Zubaydah's interest in forcing disclosure of government abuse.",Kagan,0,

2021-005,161,"There comes a point where we should not be ignorant as judges of what we know to be true as citizens. See Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 52, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949). This case takes us well past that point. Zubaydah seeks information about his torture at the hands of the CIA. The events in question took place two decades ago. They have long been declassified. Official reports have been published, books written, and movies made about them. Still, the government seeks to have this suit dismissed on the ground it implicates a state secret—and today the Court acquiesces in that request. Ending this suit may shield the government from some further modest measure of embarrassment. But respectfully, we should not pretend it will safeguard any secret.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,164,"Start with what the government itself has said about Zubaydah. In 2014, a Select Committee of the United States Senate published a 683-page report about the CIA's detention and interrogation practices. The report did not focus on Zubaydah  alone, but it included certain details about his treatment, including the following. After his capture in Pakistan in March 2002, the government transported him to a black site known as Detention Site Green. See S. Rep. No. 113-288, pp. 21-23 (2014) (Senate Report).1 At that time, CIA officials thought Zubaydah might have been the third or fourth man in al Qaeda and withholding information about the September 11 attacks and potential future assaults. Id., at 410-411 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,165,"In an effort to extract that information, the CIA hired two contractors, James Mitchell and John Jessen, and authorized them to employ what it called enhanced interrogation techniques. Brief for United States 3. Mitchell and Jessen worked on a near 24-hour-per-day basis starting August 4, 2002. Senate Report 40, see also id., at 35, 42.2 They waterboarded Zubaydah at least 80 times, simulated live burials in coffins for hundreds of hours, and performed rectal exams designed to establish total control over the detainee. Id., at 42-43, 82, 231, n. 1316, 488, 495 (internal quotation marks omitted). Six days into his ordeal, Zubaydah was sobbing, twitching, and hyperventilating. Id., at 41, 43, 111-112. During one waterboarding session, Zubaydah became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth. Id., at 43-44 (internal quotation marks omitted). He became so compliant that he would prepare for waterboarding at the snap of a finger. Id., at 43.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,166,"By this point, Mitchell and Jessen concluded that it was `highly unlikely' that Zubaydah possessed the information they were seeking, and they sought to end the interrogations. Id., at 42. It seems their assessment may have been correct. Although Zubaydah's relationship with al Qaeda remains the subject of debate today, the authors of the Senate Report found that the CIA's records do not support the suggestion that he was involved in the September 11 attacks. Id., at 410. At the time, however, CIA headquarters was not yet persuaded by Mitchell's and Jessen's report. It instructed the pair to continue their work. Id., at 43. Following these directions, Mitchell and Jessen carried on for two more weeks until their superiors finally concluded that Zubaydah did not possess any new terrorist threat information. Id., at 40, 45.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,167,"In December 2002, the government moved Zubaydah to another black site, this one known as Detention Site Blue. Id., at 67. After a stay there and, it seems, years of further transfers among other black sites, Zubaydah was transferred to the government's detention center in Guantánamo Bay in 2006. Brief for United States 2. More than 15 years later, he remains there still. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,169,"The Senate Report is only the start of what we know. As far back as 2007, the Council of Europe issued a lengthy report finding that the CIA held Zubaydah at a black site in Poland after his capture.3 In  2012, Aleksander Kwasniewski, the President of Poland from 1995 to 2005, told reporters that the CIA site was established with his knowledge.4 In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights found beyond reasonable doubt that Zubaydah was detained in Poland from December 2002 until September 2003.5 In support of its conclusion, the ECHR cited evidence spanning over 100 pages, including declassified flight records, Polish governmental records, and eyewitness testimony. Many other public sources have likewise documented that Zubaydah was transported from Detention Site Green to Detention Site Blue in Poland in December 2002— and that he remained there until September 2003.6",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,170,"We know even more from Mitchell and Jessen themselves. The pair have spoken and written extensively—without governmental objection—about their activities. In 2016, the CIA permitted Mitchell to publish a book. Enhanced Interrogation is available on Amazon from $13.99, where it is touted as lifting the curtain on the CIA's interrogation program, including its methods, and its downfall.7 In 2017, as part of a lawsuit brought by other former CIA detainees, the government allowed Mitchell and Jessen to testify how they conceived the idea of waterboarding detainees, how they asked the CIA to discontinue the use of enhanced interrogation techniques with Zubaydah, and how headquarters refused. See Stipulation Regarding Discovery in Salim v. Mitchell, No. 2:15-cv-286 (ED Wash. 2015), ECF Doc. 47, Brief for Respondents 7-8. In 2020, the pair testified with governmental permission once more, this time in military commission hearings at Guantánamo Bay. Over eight days, covering 2,000 pages of testimony, Mitchell explained how Zubaydah was waterboarded and kept awake for 126 consecutive hours, along with other details about the CIA's techniques.8 Jessen provided similar testimony.9 In 2021, Mitchell even appeared in an HBO documentary about his activities and treatment of Zubaydah. See The Forever Prisoner (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,172,"Still, Zubaydah's story remains incomplete. While we know that the CIA held Zubaydah at Detention Site Blue from December 2002 until September 2003, and while we know that the site was in Poland, what happened to him there remains unclear. The Senate Report explains that he was tortured immediately before that period, during his time at Detention Site Green. Senate Report 208, n. 1207. The Senate Report also recounts how Mitchell and Jessen tortured other detainees at Detention Site Blue, including details about how they waterboarded one detainee 183 times over two weeks. Id., at 65-72, 77-93, 101, 103, 268. But, Zubaydah's lawyers tell  us, the details of Zubaydah's treatment during this singular period are not yet publicly documented.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,173,"Today, Polish prosecutors are seeking to unravel that part of the story and determine whether criminal charges are appropriate in that country. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1782, Zubaydah's attorneys filed this domestic lawsuit to obtain discovery from Mitchell and Jessen to assist the Polish investigation. Section 1782 allows suits of just this kind: It provides that federal courts may order persons in this country to give testimony or produce documents for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,174,"Early in the litigation, Zubaydah's lawyers issued subpoenas to Mitchell and Jessen seeking their depositions and the production of documents. See Appendix, ante, at 972-973. Essentially, the requests fell into three main categories. Zubaydah's lawyers sought: (1) information to confirm that Detention Site Blue was located in Poland, (2) details about Zubaydah's interrogation, his treatment, and his conditions of confinement, and (3) information about the involvement of Polish officials.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,175,"The government filed a motion seeking to have the petition for discovery dismissed in its entirety. In support, the government supplied a declaration from then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo. The declaration conceded that the enhanced interrogation techniques employed with respect to specific detainees in the program, and their conditions of confinement, are no longer classified. App. to Pet. for Cert. 143a, id., at 153a. At the same time, the declaration asserted that the location of Detention Site Blue remained a state secret. And the declaration averred that soliciting information about the involvement of Polish nationals could complicate national security. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,176,"In response, Zubaydah's lawyers sought an accommodation. While they continued to pursue all of their requested discovery, they also acknowledged the District Court's power to modify or limit their discovery requests. Id., at 42a. And they stressed that valuable discovery may proceed without requiring Mitchell and Jessen to confirm either the location of any particular site, or the cooperation of any particular government. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Zubaydah's lawyers noted, too, that the government had previously allowed Mitchell and Jessen to testify about their activities at other detention sites using code names, and they offered to follow the same protocol here. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,177,"In the end, however, the District Court granted the government's motion to dismiss. In doing so, the court rejected the government's suggestion that its detention site in Poland remained a state secret. The court concluded the state secrets privilege did not apply because of how much attention the site had received over the years and the government's failure to explain how acknowledging the site would cause further harm. Id., at 52a-53a, 59a. Still, the court expressed concern that if Mitchell and Jessen exposed the names of Polish officials and their roles at the site, it could complicate national security in light of the government's declaration. Id., at 59a.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,178,"On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. With respect to the third category of information Zubaydah sought, concerning the involvement of Polish nationals, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court and the government. Discovery into the identities and roles of foreign individuals involved with the detention facility, operational details about the facility, and any contracts  made with Polish government officials or private persons residing in Poland might implicate the CIA's intelligence gathering efforts. Husayn v. Mitchell, 938 F.3d 1123, 1134 (C.A.9 2019).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,179,"At the same time, the Ninth Circuit held that the District Court erred by refusing discovery into the first and second categories of information Zubaydah sought. With respect to the first, the Court of Appeals pointed to the District Court's finding that the CIA's detention facility in Poland was widely known and did not qualify as a state secret. Ibid. Given that finding, the Court of Appeals concluded, Zubaydah was entitled to discovery about the site's location. Ibid. With respect to the second category, the Court of Appeals held that information about the use of interrogation techniques, conditions of confinement, and the details of Abu Zubaydah's treatment could be provided without risk to any state secret. Ibid. The court stressed that Mitchell and Jessen had already provided similar information about Zubaydah's treatment at other locations in past cases using code names, it saw no reason why the same course could not be followed here. Id., at 1137. The Court of Appeals faulted the District Court for failing to disaggregate or limit the scope of Zubaydah's requests before dismissing them all. Id., at 1136-1137.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,181,"Dissatisfied with its partial victory before the Ninth Circuit, the government seeks further relief in this Court. But as it comes to us, the parties' dispute is limited. Zubaydah does not appeal the Ninth Circuit's decision. So while the majority (repeatedly) emphasizes the breadth of his initial discovery requests, ante, at 965-966, 967-968, that is beside the point. No one argues that Zubaydah may pursue the third category of information he initially sought—including the identities and roles of foreign individuals involved with the detention facility.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,182,"Even when it comes to the two remaining categories of information at issue—the location of the government's detention site and the CIA's treatment of Zubaydah there—the parties' dispute has narrowed substantially. The District Court found that the site's location did not implicate a state secret, and the Court of Appeals agreed. The government asserts this decision was mistaken, while Zubaydah's lawyers defend it. But, as they have throughout the litigation, Zubaydah's lawyers also offer an alternative. Before the District Court, they stressed that valuable discovery could proceed into Zubaydah's interrogations, treatment, and conditions of confinement without requiring Mitchell and Jessen to confirm the location of any particular site or the cooperation of foreign nationals. App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a (internal quotation marks omitted). Before this Court, they stress the same point. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,183,"As it arrives before us, then, the central question in this case concerns the request for information about what happened inside Abu Zubaydah's cell between December 2002 and September 2003. Ibid. It is this information—about Zubaydah's interrogation, treatment, and conditions of confinement at the hands of the CIA—that Zubaydah's lawyers say they need most. Nor does anyone suggest this request implicates a state secret. The government does not (and cannot) claim that its custody of Zubaydah at a black site remains a state secret: That much was declassified and documented in the Senate Report years ago. See, e.g., Senate Report 67. The government has conceded, too, that the interrogation techniques Mitchell and Jessen employed and Zubaydah's conditions of confinement and treatment within his  cell during that period are no longer classified. App. to Pet. for Cert. 143a, id., at 153a. At a minimum, Zubaydah's lawyers argue, all this means he should be allowed discovery from Mitchell and Jessen about his interrogations, treatment, and conditions of confinement from December 2002 until September 2003, with safeguards to protect against the disclosure of the site's location and the involvement of foreign nationals.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,184,"This request is not a novel one. As Zubaydah's attorneys observe, the Senate Report discussed the treatment of detainees at various sites during specific time periods while referring to those locations by code name—Green, Cobalt, Blue. See, e.g., Senate Report 99-108 (referencing torture of various detainees at Detention Site Cobalt). In extensive civil litigation preceding this suit, Mitchell and Jessen testified using the same practice—speaking about the treatment of detainees during specific periods while using code names where appropriate. Stipulation Regarding Discovery in Salim v. Mitchell, No. 2:15-cv-286. The military commissions where the government allowed Mitchell and Jessen to appear employed the same procedure too.

2021-005,189,"At the same time, in this arena as in many others, the Constitution sometimes envisions a degree of interdependence between the branches of our government. So, for example, while the Executive bears many responsibilities over foreign affairs, Congress alone possesses the power to raise armies, maintain a navy, declare war, and fund foreign expeditions. Art. I, § 8. Also, Congress enjoys substantial power when it comes to regulating the jurisdiction of the federal courts—a power it has employed from time to time to authorize judges to entertain cases and controversies implicating foreign affairs.

In this country, no one stands above the law, not even the President may deflect evidentiary inquiries just because they may prove inconvenient or embarrassing. See Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 2412, 2427-2428, 207 L.Ed.2d 907 (2020), Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 646, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (JACKSON, J., concurring) (No penance would ever expiate the sin against free government of holding that a President can escape control of executive powers by law through assuming his military role).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,191,"None of this is to suggest that the state secrets privilege is inconsistent with our separation of powers. Even a statute that constitutionally allows federal courts to pass on matters touching on foreign affairs in most cases may, in some applications, trench on powers the Constitution reserves for the Executive. It is simply that the privilege is no blunderbuss and courts may not flee from the field at its mere display. Instead, when the Executive seeks to withhold every man's evidence from a judicial proceeding thanks to the powers it enjoys under Article II, that claim must be carefully assessed against the competing powers Articles I and III have vested in Congress and the Judiciary. The original design of the Constitution and our historic commitment to the rule of law demand no less. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).10",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,193,"The Constitution's insistence on this point is clear from our history. Today, the Executive demands utmost deference to its judgment that Zubaydah's suit should be dismissed. Brief for United States 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). But over 200 years ago, an attorney for the United States acting on behalf of President Jefferson pursued a similar line, insisting on the President's right to withhold evidence that might contain state secrets from the trial of Aaron Burr. United States v. Burr, 25 F.Cas. 30, 31 (C.C. Va. 1807). And Chief Justice Marshall expressly refused to afford that kind of latitude.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,194,"To be sure, under English law the King could do no wrong, he could not be named in debate, and he enjoyed largely unfettered discretion to withhold evidence from legal proceedings. See id., at 34. But, Chief Justice Marshall explained, such rules have no place in our Republic given that many points of difference  exist between the first magistrate in England and the first magistrate of the United States. Ibid. Instead, if the President wishes to withhold evidence from a lawfully authorized judicial proceeding he must at least state the particular reasons for his action. United States v. Burr, 25 F.Cas. 187, 192 (C.C. Va. 1807). And while the Judiciary should pay all proper respect to those reasons, as an independent branch of government it must decide for itself whether to sustain a claim of privilege in  its proceedings, bearing in mind that it is a very serious thing to allow any party to withhold relevant evidence. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,195,"Had Chief Justice Marshall envisioned a rule of utmost deference to executive claims of privilege replicating something like the privilege the English crown enjoyed, it would have been the simplest thing for him to say so. Instead, the clear implication of his opinions in Burr is that the President's special interests may warrant a careful judicial screening of subpoenas after the President interposes an objection, but that some subpoenas will nevertheless be properly sustained by judicial orders of compliance. Nixon v. Sirica, 487 F.2d 700, 710 (C.A.D.C. 1973). And the ultimate decision on such matters remains with a court of law. Ibid., see also Vance, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2423.11",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,196,"Almost 150 years after Burr, the Court reaffirmed this same understanding in United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 73 S.Ct. 528, 97 L.Ed. 727 (1953). There, executive officials once more sought something like utmost deference to their claim that evidence should be suppressed from judicial proceedings in the name of national security. Id., at 6, 73 S.Ct. 528. And once more the Court refused to indulge that view. In England, Kings may have enjoyed the kind of latitude the government sought. Id., at 7, 73 S.Ct. 528 (citing Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., 1942 A. C. 624). But under our Constitution, Reynolds emphasized, the Executive may not judge its own case: Judicial control over the evidence in a case cannot be abdicated to the caprice of executive officers. 345 U.S., at 9-10, 73 S.Ct. 528.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,197,"In this particular, our Nation broke from English practice. The Declaration of Independence did not endorse crown prerogatives but described many as evils. The Constitution did not create a President in the King's image but envisioned an executive regularly checked and balanced by other authorities. Our Founders knew from hard experience the intolerable abuses that flow from unchecked executive power.

2021-005,199,"United States, the President persuaded this Court to permit the forced internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War II. 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944). The President did so in part by relying on a military report that insisted immediate action was imperative to national security. Id., at 235-236, 65 S.Ct. 193 (MURPHY, J., dissenting). The report, however, contained information executive officials knew to be false at the time. Yet it took decades before the government publicly acknowledged its misrepresentation to this Court. See Dept. of Justice, Archives, N. Katyal, Confessions of Error: The Solicitor General's Mistakes During the Japanese-American Internment Cases (May 20, 2011). And still more years passed before this Court formally repudiated its decision. See Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 2392, 2423, 201 L.Ed.2d 775 (2018).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,200,"In Reynolds, a similar story unfolded. There, families of civilians killed in the crash of an Air Force plane sued the government for negligence and sought its official accident report. The government invoked the state secrets privilege and filed a declaration asking courts to shield the document from disclosure. In response, this Court refused to afford the government utmost deference but ultimately allowed it to withhold the report. The Court did so without even pausing to review the report independently in chambers or asking a lower court to take up that task. See Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528. Decades later, when the government released the report, it turned out to contain no state secrets—only convincing proof of governmental negligence. See J. Weinstein, The Role of Judges in a Government of, by, and for the People: Notes for the Fifty-Eighth Cardozo Lecture, 30 Cardozo L. Rev. 1, 92 (2008). So it seems that, in the very case where this Court stressed the importance of carefully examining claims of privilege, families were denied access to proof to which they were lawfully entitled only because this Court accepted the Executive's declaration at face value.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,201,"More recent history bears its cautions too. The government invoked the state secrets privilege only 16 times between 1961 and 1980. See Brief for Public Citizen as Amicus Curiae 9. Yet it has done so at least 49 times between 2001 and 2021. See id., at 9-10. What is more, the propriety of several of these assertions has been called into question. Id., at 10-17 (collecting examples), see also id., at 21-24 (documenting alleged improper governmental withholding of information in FOIA cases), W. Weaver & R. Pallitto, State Secrets and Executive Power, 120 Pol. Sci. Q. 85, 101, 107-112 (2005) (Weaver & Pallitto).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,202,"For decades, public servants ranging from Erwin Griswold to Donald Rumsfeld and Porter Goss have complained about overclassification by the Executive Branch. See, e.g., Brief for Public Citizen as Amicus Curiae 17-19. Officials who have served in the Executive Branch have estimated that between 50% and 90% of classified material does not merit that treatment. Id., at 19-20. In 1996, the federal government made about 5.8 million classification decisions, by 2017, that number reached approximately 49 million. Compare Nat. Archives and Records Admin., Information Security Oversight Office, 2010 Report to the President 12, with Nat. Archives and Records Admin., Information Security Oversight Office, 2017 Report to the President 1-2.

2021-005,203,"It may be understandable that those most responsible for the Nation's security  will seek to press every tool available to them to maximum advantage. There has always been something of a hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to test the outer limits of its power. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983). It may be nothing less than human nature. But when classification standards are so broadly drawn and loosely administered, temptation enough exists for executive officials to cover up their own mistakes and even their wrongdoing under the guise of protecting national security. K. Mayer, With the Stroke of a Pen: Executive Orders and Presidential Power 145 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court hardly needs to add fuel to that fire by abdicating any pretense of an independent judicial inquiry into the propriety of a claim of privilege and extending instead utmost deference to the Executive's mere assertion of one. Walking that path would only invite more claims of secrecy in more doubtful circumstances—and facilitate the loss of liberty and due process history shows very often follows.12",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,205,"Accepting that independent judgment is required of us in cases like this one, how exactly should we proceed? If the government's utmost deference test is not appropriate, what rules are? Our precedents offer a number of lessons.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,206,"First, Reynolds held that, when the Executive seeks to withhold evidence from a congressionally authorized judicial proceeding, it must show a reasonable danger of harm to national security would follow otherwise. 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. To be sure, most parties who seek to invoke an evidentiary privilege bear the burden of showing their entitlement to do so by a preponderance of proof. See, e.g., 1 C. Mueller & T. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence § 1:32, pp. 213-214 (4th ed. Supp. 2021). And here the government's burden is a good deal more forgiving. But I can also see why. The line Reynolds drew seeks to accommodate the separation of powers: It ensures that a congressional mandate to entertain a case or controversy will not be automatically frustrated. It guarantees a degree of independent judicial review. Yet it also seeks to respect the Executive's specially assigned constitutional responsibilities in the field of foreign affairs and the delicate and complex predictive judgments the Executive often must make there.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,207,"Second, when assessing a state secrets claim courts may—and often should—review the evidence supporting the government's claim of privilege in camera. Reynolds said that when the government can show a reasonable danger of harm exists by means of a declaration, a court  should not  insist upon an examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers. 345 U.S., at 8, 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. But at the same time, the Court also stressed that, before excluding evidence, a judge must be satisfied that a reasonable danger of harm would flow from its production—and that this is a responsibility no court may abdicate. Id., at 9-10, 73 S.Ct. 528. From this, it follows that in cases of doubt more careful scrutiny is required before a court may uphold a claim of privilege.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,208,"It is at this point, too, where the magnitude of a party's need for the requested evidence may become relevant. Reynolds explained that the extent of a party's need for the government's evidence can inform how far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate. Id., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. But Reynolds did not create a threshold inquiry requiring a litigant to demonstrate its need for relevant evidence before the government must show a reasonable danger of harm would flow from its production. Today's majority recognizes this point, explaining that only after satisfying itself that the Government has offered a valid reason for invoking the privilege would a court turn to the issue of necessity. Ante, at 970 (citing Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10-11, 73 S.Ct. 528).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,209,"Here again, I see a balance consistent with the Constitution's design. A court persuaded that the government has met its burden by declaration may find the privilege properly invoked. But a court harboring questions must probe further and examine the bases for the government's assertions in camera. Nor may a court allow the government to deny access to every man's evidence unless and until it establishes its lawful entitlement to do so. This Court has endorsed a similar procedure for resolving claims of executive privilege in other contexts. See, e.g., Nixon, 418 U.S., at 713-715, and n. 21, 94 S.Ct. 3090. Congress has authorized parallel procedures in several statutes implicating national security information. See, e.g., Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 1785, as amended, 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. App. § 4, p. 414. And courts routinely test claims of entitlement to other ancient and venerable privileges in just this way. See, e.g., United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 556, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989) (holding that in camera review may be used to probe crime-fraud challenges to attorney-client privilege), see also n. 12, supra (observing that privileges generally should be recognized only within the narrowest limits defined by the principles animating them (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,210,"Third, the state secrets privilege protects the government from the duty to supply certain evidence, but it does not prevent a litigant from insisting that the government produce nonprivileged evidence in its possession. Nor does the privilege preclude a litigant from pursuing its case otherwise. As our cases explain, the trial simply goes on without the government's privileged proof. General Dynamics Corp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 485, 131 S.Ct. 1900, 179 L.Ed.2d 957 (2011), see also Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 11, 73 S.Ct. 528. In this way, the state secrets privilege again operates like many others —whether self-incrimination, attorney-client, or spousal—by suspending a party's duty to provide privileged evidence but never prohibiting an opponent from seeking nonprivileged evidence or proving its case using facts obtainable through other means. See, e.g., Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 761, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). In this way, too, it seems to me that the privilege seeks to respect the separation of powers. The Executive  may have a national security interest in keeping certain evidence to itself. It may have an interest in avoiding the necessity of having to confirm or deny a fact. But that executive interest does not extend to quashing suits that Congress has authorized the Judiciary to entertain—and that the Judiciary has a virtually unflagging duty to resolve. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist., 424 U.S., at 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,211,"Admittedly, this Court has held that some contract disputes between spies and the government may be dismissed at their outset. See Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 107, 23 L.Ed. 605 (1876), Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 3, 125 S.Ct. 1230, 161 L.Ed.2d 82 (2005). But the Court has done so only on the ground and to the extent that allowing these cases to proceed would `inevitably lead to the disclosure of' state secrets. General Dynamics, 563 U.S., at 486, 131 S.Ct. 1900 (quoting Totten, 92 U.S. at 107). In rare cases like these, it may simply be impossible to adjudicate a claim without privileged evidence from the government. Still, none of that displaces the general rule that the privilege protects only against the production of certain evidence —not the inconvenience of lawsuits. If a way exists for a court to discharge its statutory duty to entertain a case without the government's privileged proof, that way must be found. Dismissal may be an easy out, but it is only rarely the correct one. Even English courts applying the old crown privilege sometimes afforded litigants the chance to prove their cases independently without the benefit of privileged proof. See, e.g., H. M. S. Bellerophon, 44 LJR 5, 5-9 (Admlty. 1875).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,212,"Fourth, after the government properly invokes the privilege, a court may still be able to explore options to make the government's evidence available to litigants in some form as long as it fully respects the government's national security interests. Lower courts have a long history here. They have used protective orders and other security procedures to allow sensitive governmental information to be shared— options Congress has borrowed and endorsed for use in cases arising under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the Classified Information Procedures Act. 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), 18 U.S.C. App. §§ 3-4, p. 414. Lower courts have appointed special masters with security clearances to provide unclassified summaries to litigants who lack such clearances. See, e.g., In re United States Dept. of Defense, 848 F.2d 232, 234 (C.A.D.C. 1988). Judges have worked with executive officials to craft nonprivileged substitute versions of particular pieces of evidence. Cf. In re Sealed Case, 494 F.3d 139, 153 (C.A.D.C. 2007), see also 18 U.S.C. App. § 6(c)(1), p. 415. Suppressing evidence from a congressionally authorized judicial proceeding may not be an appropriate remedy if valid executive interests can be fully protected by less intrusive means.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,214,"The majority does not dispute that the principles set out in Part II should guide the resolution of any state secrets dispute. See ante, at 967-968. Instead, the majority insists that the only disagreement between us concerns how these principles should apply to the specific discovery requests Zubaydah has made in this litigation. Ibid. Recall that the Ninth Circuit permitted discovery on just two things: (1) the location of the CIA's detention site, and (2) details about Zubaydah's interrogation by the CIA, his treatment, and his conditions of confinement.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,216,"Start with the first of these. The Executive seeks to withhold evidence about the  location of its detention site from a congressionally authorized judicial proceeding. To do so, it bears the burden of showing that a reasonable danger of harm to national security would follow from sharing the information sought. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. How does the government seek to discharge that burden in this case? Zubaydah seeks evidence from Mitchell and Jessen. The pair have long since stopped working for the government. Still, the government insists, any evidence they supply would be widely understood as speaking for the Executive Branch. Brief for United States 26. (That premise I accept for argument's sake.) And, the government continues, if the pair were asked to confirm or deny the existence of a black site in Poland, their answer could complicate efforts to secure assistance from foreign governments for future operations. Id., at 27-28.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,217,"Even on its own terms, however, the government's submission faces an immediate problem. What was once a secret can, with the passage of time, become old news. See United States v. Ahmad, 499 F.2d 851, 855 (C.A.3 1974). There may be cases where requiring the government to confirm a widely known but not officially disclosed fact could pose a national security risk sufficient to justify withholding evidence. See ante, at 698-969. Hypothetically, as the Court explains, demanding the government to admit the existence of a CIA site in Country A could diminish the extent to which the intelligence services of Countries A, B, C, D, etc. might be willing to cooperate with our own intelligence services in the future. Ante, at 969. The difficulty is, the government has not carried its burden of showing this case falls into that category.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,218,"The record before us is stark. Zubaydah's detention in Poland took place 20 years ago. The location of the CIA's detention site has been acknowledged by the former Polish President, investigated by the Council of Europe, and proven beyond reasonable doubt to the European Court of Human Rights. See Part I-B, supra. Doubtless, these disclosures may have done damage to national security interests. But nothing in the record of this case suggests that requiring the government to acknowledge what the world already knows to be true would invite a reasonable danger of additional harm to national security. The government's only evidence is a declaration couched in conclusory terms, which the District Court found unpersuasive. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, 52a-53a, 59a. It rests on the same sort of hypothetical the majority posits today—making no effort to grapple with the particulars of this case.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,219,"Even the majority seems uncomfortable with the government's declaration. The best the majority can say is this: The location of a CIA detention site in Poland qualifies as a state secret because we have found nothing in the evidentiary record that casts doubt on the declaration's conclusory assertion that national security harms could follow from acknowledging its existence. Ante, at 969-970. But notice how this effectively reverses the burden of proof. The majority starts with the government's conclusory assertion—and then proceeds to place on Zubaydah the burden of disproving it. A bare expression of national security concern becomes reason enough to deny the ancient right to every man's evidence.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,220,"This may be a nice move, but it is unpersuasive. Since Burr, this Court has held that the Executive must do more than assert a harm to national security might follow from producing evidence. See Part II-B, supra. Since Reynolds, this Court has required a reasonable, not a speculative, showing of harm. See Part II-B, supra.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,221,"If the government could withhold evidence and even compel the dismissal of lawsuits based on nothing more than a conclusory assertion of national security concerns—and if the burden fell on private persons to disprove those concerns—it is hard to imagine what case a court could not be forced to close. That kind of executive prerogative might have once been part of the law of England, it has never been the law here. See Parts II-B and II-C, supra.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,222,"Under our law, a court not fully satisfied by the government's showing of harm has a duty to inquire further. See Part II-C, supra. In this case, I would have thought that concerns about the conclusory nature of the government's declaration would have led the Court at least to remand the matter to the District Court for in camera review of any evidence the government might wish to present to substantiate its privilege claim. Crediting doubtful representations has led this Court to embarrassments in the past. See Part II-B, supra. I would not risk a repeat.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,224,"Looking past these problems only serves to expose another and maybe more fundamental one. Assume now with the government that confirming the existence of a detention site in Poland really does qualify as a state secret. Put aside that part of the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing discovery to proceed on that question. What about the Court of Appeals' separate holding that Zubaydah is entitled to discovery about his interrogation, treatment, and conditions of confinement? Recall that Zubaydah's lawyers have long maintained that, at a minimum, they should be allowed to ask about those matters within the date range of December 2002 through September 2003 and without reference to geography or Polish personnel. See Part I-C, supra. Recall, too, that even the government has conceded that the enhanced interrogation techniques employed with respect to specific detainees in the program, and their conditions of confinement, are no longer classified. App. to Pet. for Cert. 143a. Normally, a statutorily authorized case must continue without the government's privileged proof. See Part II-C, supra. Why should this case be different and face dismissal at its outset?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,225,"A plurality of the Court answers with a worry.13 It fears that any response to Zubaydah's discovery requests would inevitably tend to confirm or deny whether the CIA operated a detention site located in Poland. Ante, at 972. Apparently, the plurality is concerned that, during the course of their testimony about Zubaydah's treatment, Mitchell and Jessen might inadvertently disclose the location of their activities. See ibid. To ward against this possibility, the plurality insists, dismissal is the only option.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,226,"But that has never been enough to justify an invocation of the state secrets doctrine to shield evidence, let alone the dismissal of a lawsuit. No one cites any legal authority—even under the old crown privilege in England—allowing the Executive to withhold nonprivileged information and demand a suit's dismissal only because executive agents might accidentally disclose privileged information along the way. Surely a party's propensity for error cannot be a point in its favor.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,227,"Nor is that the only thing surprising about the plurality's argument. Many familiar judicial tools exist to protect parties  from their inadvertent disclosures. In prior detainee civil litigation, the government attended Mitchell's and Jessen's depositions and instructed them not to answer certain sensitive questions. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 7-8. The District Court could insist on that same procedure here. As an added precaution, the District Court could conduct any depositions in its presence. Alternatively, the court could enter a protective order preventing the parties from sharing documents or other information with Polish authorities or the public until the government has a chance to review them. Alternatively still, Mitchell and Jessen could be directed to provide their materials to the District Court so that the court and the government would have a chance to review their submissions before they are even transmitted to Zubaydah's lawyers. It seems the government found advance review procedures like these sufficient when it allowed Mitchell to publish a book about his involvement in the CIA's interrogation program. It is unclear why they should be insufficient now. See Part I-B, supra.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,228,"On top of all that, the District Court might require Mitchell and Jessen to use code names or redact privileged information when supplying their evidence. The Senate Report used these tools, speaking of Detention Site Blue in lieu of Poland more than 60 times and redacting certain materials from its public report, all while recounting in detail how Mitchell and Jessen tortured other detainees at that site. See Part I-B, supra. Mitchell and Jessen likewise used code names to shield foreign country names when they testified in prior civil litigation and before a military commission at Guantánamo Bay. Indeed, according to an amicus, the government even filed a motion in the military commission proceedings endorsing the practice. See Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation as Amicus Curiae 23.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,229,"The plurality barely pauses to consider any of these safeguards against the government's potential negligence. It acknowledges these techniques have successfully prevented the disclosure of classified information in previous litigation on related subject matter. Ante, at 972. But in a bare ipse dixit, the plurality asserts these same tools would not be effective here. Ibid. In failing to give careful consideration to potential safeguards that would allow this case to proceed, the plurality defies a central and consistent teaching of this Court's state secrets jurisprudence— that executive claims of privilege in congressionally authorized proceedings are not to be reflexively accepted, and remedies short of dismissal must be preferred. See Part II-C, supra. The plurality confuses appropriate deference to the Executive's predictive judgments about foreign affairs with inappropriate deference to the Executive's concerns about its own mishaps, misstatements, and mistakes. In the process, the plurality abdicates judicial responsibility to use ordinary tools of litigation management in favor of the Executive's wish to brush this case out the door. We do no honor to the rule of law in acquiescing to that impulse.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,231,"Unable to explain how the government would be harmed by allowing this litigation to continue, the plurality seeks to flip the script. Now, it contends that much of the information Zubaydah seeks is already publicly available from other sources, so further judicial probing of the Government's privilege claim is unwarranted. Ante, at 971.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,232,This submission faces its own problems. A litigant's necessity for the evidence he seeks may inform how far a court must go in testing the government's claim of privilege.,Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,233,"But in all cases the government bears the burden of proving its entitlement to the privilege. See Part II-C, supra. And it has not carried that burden here. The government worries about confirming the location of its detention site, but it has not shown how doing so would harm national security in light of how well documented that fact already is. Worse, the government has not even shown how this lawsuit would require it to confirm the location of its detention site. We do not have in this case a question about how far to probe the government's privilege claim, we have not probed that claim at all. We have replaced independent inquiry with a rubber stamp.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,234,"Troubling, too, the plurality's argument rests on facts of its own surmise. Yes, a great deal of public information exists about Zubaydah's treatment during other periods. And maybe the location of his detention site is known to the world. But Zubaydah's lawyers tell us that the public record contains no comparable information about what happened inside his cell from December 2002 until September 2003. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. That, they say, is the primary reason this lawsuit exists. See Part I-C, supra. The government does not seriously dispute the comparative lack of public evidence about Zubaydah's treatment during the relevant period—and it is unclear why the plurality pursues the point on the government's behalf. As recently as 2015, the government rejected a diplomatic request by Polish prosecutors seeking information about Zubaydah's treatment. Letter from B. Fletcher, Acting Solicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court 1, 3 (Oct. 15, 2021) (Government Letter).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,235,"Rather than face these problems, the plurality attempts a way around them. Perhaps Zubaydah does not yet have the information he needs. But, the plurality replies, we recently received a letter from the government. In it, the government says it will now allow Zubaydah to mail a document from Guantánamo Bay to Polish prosecutors detailing his treatment during the relevant period. So at least in this way, the plurality reasons, Zubaydah's need for evidence from Mitchell and Jessen may become diminished in the future. Ante, at 971-972.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,236,"It is easy enough to see why the plurality hedges here. Not only has the government already once refused a request from Polish authorities asking for information about Zubaydah's treatment. The government's apparent change of heart came only after argument in this case, in response to questions from the bench. And a closer look at the government's offer unmasks its emptiness. No one seems confident that Zubaydah remains mentally competent to testify about his treatment decades ago.14 Pointedly, too, the government states in its letter that it reserves the right to subject whatever he produces to a security review —all without indicating what standards it will apply in that review. Government Letter 3. In the end, then, the government's offer seems little more than an offer to let Zubaydah say whatever the government chooses to allow him to say.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,237,"Then there is this. In response to the government's letter, Zubaydah's lawyers have lodged their own. In it, as they have before, they offer a middle way. At the very least, Zubaydah's lawyers ask this Court to hold off dismissing this case until we know whether and to what extent the  government will make good on its late-blooming promise. Letter from D. Klein, Counsel for Respondent Abu Zubaydah, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court 2 (Oct. 25, 2021). Yet rather than remand this case to allow the District Court to supervise that process, the plurality refuses even this paltry accommodation. It does so without as much as the courtesy of an explanation.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,239,"Ultimately, the plurality is forced to give ground. While it insists that any response to Zubaydah's current requests would inevitably tend to confirm or deny whether the CIA operated a detention site located in Poland, it goes out of its way to note that a different discovery request filed by Zubaydah might avoid the problems the plurality believes exist here. Ante, at 972. In other words, it seems that Zubaydah remains free to file a new lawsuit seeking information about his interrogation, treatment, and conditions of confinement as long as he does not ask for location information where his need is not great. Id., at 971, 972.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,240,"But what is the point of forcing Zubaydah to file a new lawsuit? Location information is only part of what the Court of Appeals permitted and Zubaydah seeks. Separately, the Court of Appeals allowed Zubaydah's lawyers to inquire about his interrogation, treatment, and conditions of confinement. And throughout this litigation, Zubaydah's lawyers have indicated a willingness to employ any number of tools to disaggregate that evidence from information that might reveal the site's location or the involvement of foreign nationals. As they put it before the District Court, valuable discovery may proceed without requiring Mitchell and Jessen to confirm either the location of any particular site, or the cooperation of any particular government. App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. As the District Court acknowledged, too, courts possess substantial authority to modify or limit the scope of any party's discovery requests. Id., at 55a. It is unfathomable why this Court should ignore that option in this case and insist on a new one. At worst, the delay may effectively deny Zubaydah congressionally authorized discovery into admittedly nonprivileged information. At best, it will prove a pointless formality.*",Gorsuch,0,
2021-005,241,"In the end, only one argument for dismissing this case at its outset begins to make sense. It has nothing to do with speculation that government agents might accidentally blurt out the word Poland. It has nothing to do with the fiction that Zubaydah is free to testify about his experiences as he wishes. It has nothing to do with fears about courts being unable to apply familiar tools to disaggregate discovery regarding some issues (location, foreign nationals) from others (interrogation techniques, treatment, and conditions of confinement). Really, it seems that the government wants this suit dismissed because it hopes to impede the Polish criminal investigation and avoid (or at least delay) further embarrassment for past misdeeds. Perhaps at one level this is easy enough to understand. The facts are hard to face. We know already that our government treated Zubaydah brutally—more than 80 waterboarding sessions, hundreds of hours of live burial, and what it calls rectal rehydration. Further evidence along the same lines may lie in the government's vaults. But as embarrassing as these facts may be, there is no state secret here. This Court's duty is to the rule of law and the search for truth. We should not let shame obscure our vision.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-006,29,"This case concerns a state attorney general's attempt to intervene in a federal appellate proceeding for the purpose of defending the constitutionality of a state law. The issue arose after a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed a decision holding a Kentucky statute unconstitutional.

The panel denied that motion, but we granted review.",Alito,0,

EMW Women's Surgical Center, a clinic that performs abortions, and two of its doctors filed this action in Federal District Court and sought to enjoin the enforcement of the new law. Their complaint named four defendants, and two of these, the attorney general and the cabinet secretary for Health and Family Services, played pivotal roles in the events that followed. The attorney general is a constitutional State officer who is independently elected and serves until a successor is elected and qualified. Ky. Const. § 91.

2021-006,36,"By the same divided vote as before, the panel denied the attorney general's motion to intervene, citing Circuit precedent under which intervention on appeal is judged by essentially the same standard as intervention in district court. See Blount-Hill v. Zelman, 636 F.3d 278, 283 (C.A.6 2011). Applying that standard, the panel majority held, first, that the attorney general's motion was untimely because it was not filed until years of litigation had passed and the panel had already decided the appeal, second, that no `substantial legal interest' was at stake because the attorney general was pursuing `extraordinary' forms of review (rehearing en banc and certiorari) to which litigants are not generally entitled, and third, that allowing intervention would prejudice respondents because the attorney general's rehearing petition included an argument (that respondents lacked third-party standing) that the secretary's briefs had not raised.3 EMW  Women's Surgical Center, P.S.C. v. Friedlander, 831 Fed.Appx. 748, 749-753 (C.A.6 2020).",Alito,0,
2021-006,37,"We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Sixth Circuit should have permitted the attorney general to intervene. 592 U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 1734, 209 L.Ed.2d 503 (2021).",Alito,0,
2021-006,39,"In considering this question, we begin with respondents' contention that the attorney general's motion to intervene was jurisdictionally barred. Respondents never advanced this argument below, and the Sixth Circuit did not consider it. Nevertheless, we must assure ourselves that jurisdictional requirements are met at all stages of the cases that come before us for review, see Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006).",Alito,0,
2021-006,41,"Respondents' argument is narrow and somewhat complicated. While implicitly conceding that a court of appeals generally has jurisdiction to consider a non-party's motion to intervene in a pending appeal, they claim that one narrow sub-set of non-parties is jurisdictionally barred: those non-parties that are bound by the district court judgment. Respondents' argument goes like this. Non-parties who are bound by a judgment can obtain appellate review by filing a notice of appeal within the time prescribed by law. See 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1). These time limits are jurisdictional, see Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 209, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007), Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 315, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988), Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (per curiam). And because non-parties who are bound by a judgment can seek appellate review in this way, they cannot circumvent the jurisdictional time limits for filing a notice of appeal by filing a motion to intervene after the deadline for filing a notice of appeal has passed.",Alito,0,
2021-006,42,"Applying this theory, respondents contend that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain the attorney general's motion. Because the attorney general agreed to be bound by the judgment, respondents maintain, he could have filed a notice of appeal, but since he failed to do so within the time allowed by law, his motion for intervention should be treated like an untimely notice of appeal.",Alito,0,
2021-006,44,"This argument fails for the simple reason that no provision of law limits the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals in the way respondents suggest. We do not read a statute or rule to impose a jurisdictional requirement unless its language clearly does so. See Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 439, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011) (a provision is not jurisdictional when its language provides no clear indication that Congress wanted that provision to be treated as having jurisdictional attributes). Here, respondents cite no provision of law that deprives a court of appeals of jurisdiction to entertain a motion for intervention that is filed by a non-party who is bound by the judgment that is appealed. No such language can be found in either 28 U.S.C. § 2107, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4, or any other provision of law. We therefore see no basis for holding that petitioner's motion was jurisdictionally barred.",Alito,0,
2021-006,46,"What respondents ask us to recognize is essentially a mandatory claims-processing rule. Such rules are not jurisdictional, and if a non-jurisdictional argument was not raised below, we generally will not consider it as an alternative ground for affirmance. See, e.g., Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 38, 109 S.Ct. 2782, 106 L.Ed.2d 26 (1989). In this case, however, we do not rest our decision on respondents' failure to raise this argument in the Court of Appeals. Even if that argument had been preserved, we would not find it persuasive.",Alito,0,
2021-006,47,"Assuming for the sake of argument that parties bound by a judgment are generally permitted to appeal that judgment, we do not think it follows that a party may do so regardless of the ground on which the party is bound. Here, respondents rely on the proposition that the Attorney General, like any other `person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the terms of his agreement.' Brief for Respondents 15 (quoting Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 893, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008), emphasis added and alteration omitted). And when a non-party is bound by a judgment for this reason, it is hard to see why the non-party should be precluded from seeking intervention on appeal if the agreement preserves that opportunity.",Alito,0,
2021-006,48,"That is the situation here. In agreeing to be bound, the attorney general specifically reserved all rights, claims, and defenses in any appeals arising out of this action, App. 28-29, and this language easily covers the right to seek rehearing en banc and the right to file a petition for a writ of certiorari. In addition, the stipulation of dismissal made clear that the judgment to which the attorney general agreed to be bound was the judgment that emerged after all appellate review concluded. See id., at 30 (judgment binding on attorney general's office subject to any modification, reversal or vacation of the judgment on appeal).",Alito,0,
2021-006,49,"For these reasons, we refuse to adopt a categorical claims-processing rule that bars consideration of the attorney general's motion. In doing so, we do not attempt to set out a general rule governing the right of non-parties to appeal or to move for appellate intervention.",Alito,0,
2021-006,51,"Having concluded that neither a jurisdictional requirement nor a mandatory claims-processing rule barred consideration of the attorney general's motion, we turn to the question whether the Court of Appeals properly denied that motion. No statute or rule provides a general standard to apply in deciding whether intervention on appeal should be allowed. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure make only one passing reference to intervention, and that reference concerns the review of agency action. See Rule 15(d), Amalgamated Transit Union Int'l, AFL-CIO v. Donovan, 771 F.2d 1551, 1553, n. 3 (C.A.D.C. 1985). Without any rule that governs appellate intervention, we have looked elsewhere for guidance. Thus we have considered the policies underlying intervention in the district courts, Automobile Workers v. Scofield, 382 U.S. 205, 217, n. 10, 86 S.Ct. 373, 15 L.Ed.2d 272 (1965), including the legal interest that a party seeks to protect through intervention on appeal. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2).",Alito,0,
2021-006,53,"In defending the Kentucky law, the attorney general asserts a substantial legal interest that sounds in deeper, constitutional considerations. As we have observed,  our Constitution `split the atom of sovereignty.' Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 751, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (quoting Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 504, n. 17, 119 S.Ct. 1518, 143 L.Ed.2d 689 (1999)). The Constitution limited but did not abolish the sovereign powers of the States, which retained `a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.' Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U.S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1461, 1475, 200 L.Ed.2d 854 (2018) (quoting The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)). Paramount among the States' retained sovereign powers is the power to enact and enforce any laws that do not conflict with federal law. See U.S. Const., Art. VI, § 2. Therefore, a State clearly has a legitimate interest in the continued enforceability of its own statutes, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986), and a federal court must respect the place of the States in our federal system, Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 75, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997). This means that a State's opportunity to defend its laws in federal court should not be lightly cut off.",Alito,0,
2021-006,54,"Respect for state sovereignty must also take into account the authority of a State to structure its executive branch in a way that empowers multiple officials to defend its sovereign interests in federal court. See Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill, 587 U.S. ___, ___-___, 139 S.Ct. 1945, 1951-1952, 204 L.Ed.2d 305 (2019). In this case, although the secretary for Health and Family Services apparently enjoyed the authority under state law to defend the constitutionality of HB 454, the secretary shared that authority with the attorney general. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 15.020, see also Commonwealth ex rel. Hancock v. Paxton, 516 S.W.2d 865, 868 (Ky. 1974) (There is no question as to the right of the Attorney General to appear and be heard in a suit brought by someone else in which the constitutionality of a statute is involved). Indeed, it is the attorney general who is deemed Kentucky's chief law officer with the authority to represent the Commonwealth in all cases. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 15.020(1), (3).",Alito,0,
2021-006,55,"The importance of ensuring that States have a fair opportunity to defend their laws in federal court has been recognized by Congress. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2403(b), when a state law affecting the public interest is drawn in question in any court of the United States and neither the State nor any state agency or officer is a party, the court must notify the state attorney general, and the State must be allowed to intervene. See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24(a)(1). Even if this provision is not directly applicable in this case because the secretary for Health and Family Services was still a party when the intervention motion was filed, it nevertheless reflects the weighty interest that a State has in protecting its own laws. The way in which Kentucky divides executive authority and the unusual course that this litigation took should not obscure the important constitutional consideration at stake.4",Alito,0,
2021-006,56,"Resolution of a motion for permissive intervention is committed to the discretion of the court before which intervention is sought, see Automobile Workers,  382 U.S. at 217, n. 10, 86 S.Ct. 373, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24(b)(1)(a). But a court fails to exercise its discretion soundly when it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law, Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), and that is what happened here. The Sixth Circuit panel failed to account for the strength of the Kentucky attorney general's interest in taking up the defense of HB 454 when the secretary for Health and Family Services elected to acquiesce.5",Alito,0,
2021-006,58,"The panel also erred in its evaluation of the other factors that bear on all applications for appellate intervention. The panel found that the attorney general's motion was not timely because it came after years of litigation in the District Court and after the panel had issued its decision, but its assessment of timeliness was mistaken. Timeliness is an important consideration in deciding whether intervention should be allowed, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 24 (a) and (b)(1), but timeliness is to be determined from all the circumstances, and the point to which a suit has progressed is  not solely dispositive, NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 365-366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973).",Alito,0,
2021-006,59,"Here, the most important circumstance relating to timeliness is that the attorney general sought to intervene as soon as it became clear that the Commonwealth's interests would no longer be protected by the parties in the case. United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977). Our decision in McDonald addressed a similar situation. There, a member of a putative plaintiff class moved to intervene for the purpose of appealing the District Court's denial of class certification. Id., at 396, 97 S.Ct. 2464. The District Court denied that request because the class member had not seen fit to come in here and seek any relief from this Court in any way during five years of litigation. Id., at 390, 97 S.Ct. 2464. We held, however, that the motion was timely because it was filed soon after the movant learned that the class representatives would not appeal.",Alito,0,
2021-006,60,"The same logic applies here. The attorney general sought to intervene two days after learning that the secretary would not continue to defend HB 454. The motion was also filed within a week after the Sixth Circuit issued its decision and within the 14-day time limit for petitioning for rehearing en banc. Although the litigation by that time had proceeded for years, that factor is not dispositive. The attorney general's need to seek intervention did not arise until the secretary ceased defending the state law, and the timeliness of his motion should be assessed in relation to that point in time.",Alito,0,
2021-006,61,"Respondents argue that the attorney general should have realized as soon as Governor Beshear took office that his secretary  for Health and Family Services might abandon the defense of HB 454. Respondents state that Governor Beshear ran on a pro-choice platform and  had repeatedly withdrawn from the defense of abortion restrictions when serving as Attorney General. Brief for Respondents 28. But the new secretary whom he appointed after taking office as Governor had continued to defend the law on appeal, and respondents do not explain why the attorney general should have known that the secretary would change course after the panel's decision was handed down.",Alito,0,
2021-006,62,"In arguing to the contrary, respondents point to our decision in NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d 648, but they misread that decision. In that case, several parties unsuccessfully sought to intervene in a Voting Rights Act case after the United States, which had brought the action, consented to the entry of judgment in favor of the defendant. The District Court found that this request was untimely, and we affirmed, noting that the United States' answer to the complaint, which had been filed almost a month earlier, had revealed that the Government was without information with which it could oppose the motion for summary judgment. Id., at 367, 93 S.Ct. 2591. That response, we concluded, should have alerted the would-be intervenors about the United States' likely course of action. Ibid. We also observed, among other things, that intervention had the potential for seriously disrupting the approaching elections. Id., at 368-369, 93 S.Ct. 2591.",Alito,0,
2021-006,63,"The situation here is starkly different. As discussed, the attorney general's motion was timely, and intervention would not have produced anything like the disruption that the Court cited in NAACP v. New York. Thus, the panel was mistaken in finding that the attorney general's motion was untimely.",Alito,0,
2021-006,65,"The panel's finding on prejudice was similarly flawed. The panel argued that intervention would prejudice respondents because the attorney general's rehearing petition pressed an issue (third-party standing) that had not been raised in the secretary's briefs. 831 Fed.Appx. at 751, 752. But the lack of third-party standing was not the only argument advanced in the rehearing petition, App. 221-227, and in any event, allowing the attorney general to intervene would not have necessitated that the third-party standing issue be entertained. If the secretary for Health and Family Services had not retired from the field, he could have raised that same argument in a petition for rehearing or in a petition for certiorari. In that event, the relevant court (the Sixth Circuit in deciding whether to grant en banc review and this Court in deciding whether to grant certiorari) could have considered whether the third-party standing argument should be considered despite the secretary's failure to raise the issue at an earlier point in the litigation. That the issue was raised in the attorney general's rehearing petition, as opposed to one filed by the secretary, was immaterial.",Alito,0,
2021-006,66,"Our decision in McDonald illustrates the panel's error. In that case, we held that the defendant was not unfairly prejudiced simply because an appeal on behalf of putative class members was brought by an unnamed class member rather than by one of the original parties, 432 U.S. at 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464. The situation here is similar.",Alito,0,
2021-006,67,"Respondents advance one additional argument on the issue of prejudice. They claim that intervention would unfairly deprive them of a reasonable expectation stemming from Governor Beshear's election. Brief for Respondents 31. Respondents  contend that Governor Beshear had a history of refusing to defend abortion restrictions and that they therefore reasonably thought that the secretary, who was appointed by the Governor, would not pursue extraordinary forms of relief if they prevailed in their appeal.

2021-006,68,"The loss of this sort of claimed expectation does not amount to unfair prejudice in the sense relevant here.

2021-006,72,I join the opinion of the Court. I write to address another reason why respondents and their amici err in maintaining that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider Attorney General Cameron's motion to intervene.,Thomas,0,
2021-006,73,"As the Court explains, respondents now argue that Attorney General Cameron is jurisdictionally barred from intervening in the appeal because his predecessor, then-Attorney General Beshear, stipulated as a condition of his dismissal that the Kentucky attorney general's office would be bound by the District Court's final judgment. According to respondents, that stipulation required the attorney general to timely notice an appeal consistent with Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4 if he wished to challenge the District Court's judgment on appeal. To allow intervention in the appeal, respondents posit, would circumvent the jurisdictional requirements of Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4.",Thomas,0,
2021-006,74,"The Court rightly rejects respondents' novel argument because the attorney general's stipulation preserved his office's right to participate in the appeal. See ante, at 1009-1011. But in addition to the infirmity the Court identifies, respondents' jurisdictional argument suffers from another, more basic flaw: Rules 3 and 4 permit only parties to appeal a district court judgment, and the attorney general was not a party to the judgment after he was dismissed from the litigation.",Thomas,0,
2021-006,75,"Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) and 4(a)(1)(A) together require that any appeals from a district court judgment be pursued by filing a notice of appeal within 30 days after entry of the judgment. See also 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a). We have described this requirement as jurisdictional. See Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 315, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988), see also Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 147, 132 S.Ct. 641, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012). We have also held that Rule 3(c)—requiring, among other things, that the notice of appeal specify the party or parties taking the appeal, Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1)(A)—is likewise jurisdictional. See Torres, 487 U.S. at 314-318, 108 S.Ct. 2405, Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757, 765-766, 121 S.Ct. 1801, 149 L.Ed.2d 983 (2001). Rule 3(c)(1)(A)'s requirement that the notice specify the party taking the appeal reflects the well settled rule that only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment. Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 304, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988)  (per curiam). For example, individuals who are not parties to the underlying lawsuit and fail to intervene in the District Court cannot appeal a District Court's judgment. Ibid. We are not at liberty to create exceptions to this general rule, even when the nonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial court's judgment. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-006,76,"Here, the attorney general was not a party to the District Court's final judgment. Then-Attorney General Beshear was originally a party to this suit because he was named as a defendant in the complaint. But the District Court later dismissed Attorney General Beshear's office from the litigation in May 2018— about a year before final judgment. A party dismissed from a lawsuit is no longer a party to it after his dismissal. Just as intervention is the requisite method for a nonparty to become a party to a lawsuit, United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U.S. 928, 933, 129 S.Ct. 2230, 173 L.Ed.2d 1255 (2009), dismissal is the quintessential (if not only) method for a party to become a nonparty, see, e.g., 67A C. J. S., Parties § 86 (2013) (Once a person is dismissed from a lawsuit, he or she is generally no longer a party to it).",Thomas,0,
2021-006,77,"One need hardly look beyond the case caption to see how dismissal ended the attorney general's status as a party to the litigation. To be sure, case captions are `not determinative as to the identity of the parties to the action.' Eisenstein, 556 U.S. at 935, 129 S.Ct. 2230 (quoting 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1321, p. 388 (3d ed. 2004)). But they can be instructive, given that `the designation of persons as parties is usually made in the caption of the summons or complaint.' Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 15, 122 S.Ct. 2005, 153 L.Ed.2d 27 (2002) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 34, Comment a, Reporter's Note, p. 347 (1980)). Here, because respondents initially named then-Attorney General Beshear as the lead defendant in their complaint, the District Court's orders originally captioned the defendants as ANDREW G. BESHEAR, et al. E.g., App. 28. After the District Court dismissed the attorney general on May 21, 2018, the court ordered the clerk to modify the case caption to reflect the remaining properly named Defendants: Meier, et al. Id., at 5, 7, see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 104a (District Court final judgment listing the defendants as ADAM W. MEIER et al.). The District Court's modification of the caption confirms that when the court issued its judgment, the attorney general was no longer a party.",Thomas,0,
2021-006,78,"Because the attorney general was not a party to the District Court's final judgment, respondents' jurisdictional argument necessarily fails. As a nonparty, the attorney general could not notice an appeal under Rules 3 and 4. And because he could not notice an appeal, he could not possibly have been obligated to do so, rather than pursue intervention—the requisite method for a nonparty to become a party to a lawsuit. Eisenstein, 556 U.S. at 933, 129 S.Ct. 2230.",Thomas,0,
2021-006,79,"Respondents resist this conclusion and contend that the attorney general remained a party because then-Attorney General Beshear stipulated upon dismissal that any final judgment in this action  will be binding on the Office of the Attorney General, subject to any modification, reversal or vacation of the judgment on appeal. App. 29-30. Respondents' argument has a veneer of plausibility only because of our decision in Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 122 S.Ct. 2005, 153 L.Ed.2d 27. There, a majority of this Court  held that a nonnamed member of a certified class action was a party who could appeal the approval of a settlement to which he objected. Id., at 10, 122 S.Ct. 2005. Rejecting the settled bright-line rule that only a named party may appeal a final judgment, the Court adopted a vague, functionalist inquiry that determined party status based on context. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-006,80,"Applying that test, Devlin held that nonnamed class members are parties to the proceedings in the sense of being bound by the judgment, and it was that feature of class action litigation that required that class members be allowed to appeal the approval of a settlement. Ibid. To hold otherwise, the Court explained, would deprive nonnamed class members of the power to preserve their own interests in a settlement that will ultimately bind them. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-006,81,"I joined Justice Scalia's dissent in Devlin, which reiterated that `parties' to a judgment are those named as such— whether as the original plaintiff or defendant in the complaint giving rise to the judgment, or as `one who though not an original party becomes a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party practice.' 536 U.S. at 15, 122 S.Ct. 2005 (quoting Karcher v. May, 484 U.S. 72, 77, 108 S.Ct. 388, 98 L.Ed.2d 327 (1987), alterations omitted). The Devlin Court's holding was, and is, contrary to that well-established law. 536 U.S. at 15, 122 S.Ct. 2005. To reason, as Devlin did, that merely being bound by a judgment transformed a nonnamed class member into a party, surely came as news to law students everywhere. Id., at 18, 122 S.Ct. 2005, see also Marino, 484 U.S. at 304, 108 S.Ct. 586 (previously rejecting that individuals become parties merely because they have an interest that is affected by the trial court's judgment). After all, there are any number of persons who are not parties to a judgment yet are nonetheless bound by it. Devlin, 536 U.S. at 18, 122 S.Ct. 2005. For example, as pertinent here, when `a person agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others,' we call application of claim or issue preclusion to that person nonparty preclusion precisely because agreeing to be bound by a judgment does not alone make one a party to it. Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 893, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 40, at 390, emphasis added).",Thomas,0,
2021-006,82,"Devlin was demonstrably erroneous for the reasons set forth in Justice Scalia's dissent, and we should overrule it in an appropriate case. That said, Devlin does not control here. Several years after Devlin, in Eisenstein, we unanimously reiterated the principle that a `party' to litigation is `one by or against whom a lawsuit is brought.' 556 U.S. at 933, 129 S.Ct. 2230 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004)). Relying on Devlin's reasoning, the petitioner there argued that the United States must be a party within the meaning of Rule 4(a)(1)(B) because the Government is bound by the judgment in all actions under the False Claims Act regardless of its participation in the case. 556 U.S. at 936, 129 S.Ct. 2230. Consistent with our pre-Devlin cases, we reiterated that this fact was not determinative because nonparties may be bound by a judgment for a host of different reasons, 556 U.S. at 936, 129 S.Ct. 2230, none of which suffices to transform them into parties. We distinguished Devlin's contrary reasoning by invoking the specific class-action nature of the suit there, 556 U.S. at 934, n. 3, 129 S.Ct. 2230, essentially cabining that precedent to class actions alone. And, true to Eisenstein, we have not once relied on Devlin outside the class-action context. See United States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 584 U.S. ___, ___-___,  138 S.Ct. 1532, 1538-1539, 200 L.Ed.2d 792 (2018), Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U.S. 588, 593, 133 S.Ct. 1345, 185 L.Ed.2d 439 (2013), Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.S 299, 313-315, 131 S.Ct. 2368, 180 L.Ed.2d 341 (2011). Devlin is therefore an aberration from our otherwise consistent view that only a named party may file a notice of appeal under Rules 3 and 4. And because this case does not involve a class action, Devlin has no precedential force.* * *",Thomas,0,
2021-006,83,"The Office of the Kentucky Attorney General was not a named party to the District Court's final judgment. The attorney general, accordingly, could not notice an appeal from that judgment under Rules 3 and 4. And because the attorney general could not appeal the District Court's judgment, Attorney General Cameron moved to intervene and pursue the requisite method for a nonparty to become a party to a lawsuit. Eisenstein, 556 U.S. at 933, 129 S.Ct. 2230. Far from evading the jurisdictional requirements of Rules 3 and 4, Cameron's motion to intervene was his only legitimate option to both comply with those Rules and participate in the appeal as a party. For this reason, as well as those given in the opinion of the Court, respondents' jurisdictional argument fails.",Thomas,0,

2021-006,85,"I agree with the Court that the Sixth Circuit should have allowed the attorney general to intervene in this suit after another state official ceased defending the challenged Kentucky law. And my reasons for reaching that conclusion partly overlap with the Court's. But I would differently frame and respond to the serious threshold issue that respondent EMW raises. I also see no need to rely on constitutional considerations to resolve the intervention question before us. Ante, at 1010-1011 (opinion of the Court).",Kagan,0,
2021-006,87,"No jurisdictional rule, the Court and I agree, directly bars the attorney general's intervention here. The rule EMW relies on requires a losing party to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of judgment. See 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A). This Court has made clear that the timely-appeal rule is jurisdictional. See, e.g., Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 209, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). So if a party (or a non-party having an equivalent right to appeal) files an appeal on the 31st day after judgment, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction. But here the attorney general did not file such a late appeal. He instead moved to intervene in an appeal timely brought by Kentucky's secretary for health (after the secretary decided to forgo en banc or Supreme Court review). And the provisions setting out the timely-appeal rule do not address that situation. See ante, at 1009-1010.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,88,"The majority goes on to deny the existence of a claims-processing rule preventing the attorney general's intervention, see ante, at 1009-1011, but I think that terminology misplaced and distracting. We often consider whether timing requirements are jurisdictional rules or else claims-processing rules. See, e.g., United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 409-410, 135 S.Ct. 1625, 191 L.Ed.2d 533 (2015). (The question comes up because only the latter may be waived or overcome by equitable considerations, the former are absolute bars to entertaining a matter. See ibid.) But here we know the answer to that frequent question. As just stated, the timely-appeal rule—the only rule anyone thinks relevant—is jurisdictional.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,89,"There is not a claims-processing rule in sight. And EMW nowhere suggests otherwise, it never asserts the existence of a claims-processing rule barring the attorney general's motion.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,90,"The argument EMW makes—and it is a serious one—rests on the idea that litigants should not be allowed to use intervention procedures to end-run jurisdictional rules. Consider a hypothetical to illustrate the problem. Suppose a party (or a non-party having a right to appeal) misses the 30day deadline to file a notice of appeal from a judgment. On the 31st day, he regrets his negligence and attempts to intervene in another party's appeal in the same case. Should the appellate court allow the intervention? Our precedent, along with common sense, suggests not—even though the timely-appeal rule, as noted above, does not address issues of intervention. That is because permitting intervention there would effectively vitiate the mandatory nature of the appellate time limits. Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 315, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988). Or otherwise said, granting intervention would enable the party to circumvent those limits, by awarding him the equivalent of more time for filing a notice of appeal. Ibid., see Hutchinson v. Pfeil, 211 F.3d 515, 519 (C.A.10 2000) (Intervention is not a means to escape the consequences of noncompliance with the jurisdictional timely-appeal rule). That is the essence of EMW's objection. EMW contends that the attorney general, though a non-party, could have appealed the District Court's judgment because it bound his office. But the attorney general chose at the time not to appeal. He should not now be allowed, EMW says, to sidestep the jurisdictional deadline he missed by means of intervening. See Brief for Respondents 10, 15-16, 19-21.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,91,"But the anti-circumvention rationale for denying intervention does not sensibly apply here because of the change in circumstances between the time to appeal and the time of the motion to intervene. Recall that the attorney general, by agreeing early on to the dismissal of the claims against him, effectively handed off defense of the challenged law to the health secretary. See ante, at 1007-1008. After the District Court ruled, the secretary continued to perform that function, appealing the court's decision to strike down the law. Assume here, as EMW argues, that the attorney general also could have appealed.* Even if so, the attorney general had no reason to take that step: The secretary was handling the appeal, just as he had handled the trial court proceedings. It was only once the Sixth Circuit ruled and the secretary ceased defending the law— choosing not to seek en banc or Supreme Court review—that the (now new) attorney general had an urgent reason to rejoin the suit: If he did not, the law would be invalidated. The motion to intervene, then, was not an attempt to escape the consequences of failing to adhere to appellate deadlines, as in the hypothetical offered above. The motion was instead a response to a major shift in the litigation, creating a new demand for the attorney general's participation. And that real-world fact answers EMW's argument. Granting the motion  would not countenance an end-run around the timely-appeal rule by giving the attorney general a do-over. It would simply recognize that only after the time for appeal had come and gone had a need arisen for the attorney general to reenter the suit.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,93,"With that threshold objection answered, the issue becomes how the factors bearing on intervention motions play out. I agree with much of what the Court says on that issue (and also with its view that the attorney general's agreement did not preclude his intervention). But I see no reason to cast the analysis, even partially, in constitutional terms. See ante, at 1010-1012. Our longstanding practice is to avoid unnecessary discussion of constitutional questions. See, e.g., Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 345-348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). And contra the majority, no invocation of, or lofty observations about, the Constitution are here needed. The considerations governing intervention motions—applying equivalently to any person seeking to intervene, including the attorney general— show why the Sixth Circuit went wrong in closing off the suit. See generally Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,94,"Most fundamentally, the attorney general had a strong reason for intervening. Once again, the secretary had defended the challenged law as constitutional until the Sixth Circuit ruled, but he then decided to abandon the argument. If the attorney general could not assume the defense, and thus continue contesting EMW's claim, Kentucky could no longer enforce its statute. And it is of course true, as the majority says, that a State has a significant interest in enforcing its own laws. See ante, at 1011. As a practical matter, then, the attorney general belonged in the suit, absent some good cause to exclude him.",Kagan,0,
2021-006,95,"And as the Court concludes, no such cause was present. See ante, at 1012-1014. The intervention motion, though coming late in the suit, was still timely. The attorney general intervened as soon as he had a reason to do so—more specifically, two days after he learned that the secretary would no longer defend the challenged law. See United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977) (holding that a motion to intervene was timely because it was made as soon as it became clear that the movant's interests would no longer be protected by existing parties). And the motion was filed within the 14-day window for requesting an en banc rehearing—so did nothing to delay the suit's normal progress. See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 35(c) and 40(a)(1). Nor did the motion otherwise prejudice EMW. The attorney general sought to pursue only the usual next steps of appellate review—what the secretary would have done had he not ceased defending the law. Of course, EMW would have preferred the secretary's action to bring the case to an end. But an unrealized gain of that kind does not count as a legally cognizable harm. See McDonald, 432 U.S. at 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464 (holding that a litigant cannot claim unfair prejudice when one person takes over an appeal from another). Nothing, then, counterbalances the reasons for enabling the attorney general's inclusion.* * *",Kagan,0,
2021-006,96,"So I arrive, if via a somewhat different path, at the same endpoint as the Court. In my view, the attorney general's motion to intervene was not an end-run around the timely-appeal rule. And with that issue out of the way, this is a textbook case for intervention. The Sixth Circuit should have allowed the attorney general to step into the litigation to defend the challenged law.",Kagan,0,

To effectuate that endpoint, our legal system requires parties to abide by representations made in a lawsuit regardless of later regrets. In this case, the attorney general of Kentucky stipulated to his own dismissal as a party in the District Court and agreed to have another official represent Kentucky's interests. Only years later, and after the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment, did the attorney general ask the Court of Appeals to allow him to return based on a position he had disavowed when securing his dismissal earlier in the litigation.

The Court reaches that result only by giving short shrift to a critical and unusual aspect of this case: The attorney general's motion to intervene was based on arguments he had eschewed below and was filed only after judgments had been rendered by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals. The attorney general's change in position alone requires affirmance.",Sotomayor,0,

In the District Court, however, the attorney general took a different view. There, he represented that he had no interest in the case because H.

New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001) (quoting Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689, 15 S.Ct. 555, 39 L.Ed. 578 (1895), alteration omitted). This principle is not limited to private litigants. Courts and other parties are also entitled to rely on a State's plausible interpretation of the law it is charged with enforcing. Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 563, 131 S.Ct. 2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011). A state official's late-breaking effort to change his theory of state law comes with costs to judicial efficiency and finality, and it disrupts the expectations not only of the adversarial litigant but of other parties who may have litigated based on their understanding of both the State's position and who would represent the State's interests.2  The Court's failure to acknowledge the attorney general's switch in position leads it to an erroneous result. The Court primarily faults the Court of Appeals for failing to account for the strength of the Kentucky attorney general's interest in taking up the defense of HB 454. Ante, at 1012. All agree that States and their authorized officials have substantial sovereign interests in defending their laws. The Office of the Attorney General, however, previously represented that it had no interest in these proceedings. Had the attorney general been a private litigant, that decision would have been binding: This Court regularly has  refused to consider a party's argument that contradicted a joint `stipulation entered at the outset of the litigation.'

Ante, at 1011, see Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 12.210(1) (West 2021). The Court makes much of the attorney general's role in defending Kentucky law, but gives short shrift to the manner in which Kentucky has structured its law to allow other state officers to represent the State's interests in court.

2021-006,115,"Notably, the Court's decision to allow intervention on appeal is without precedent. Before the Court of Appeals, the attorney general was able to identify only two instances, both from the Ninth Circuit, in which a federal court of appeals granted a post-decision motion to intervene, a fact that points decisively against intervention and hardly suggests that denial of intervention would be an abuse of discretion. 831 Fed.Appx. at 750. Neither of those two cases involved a situation in which the intervenor on behalf of the State was a party to the case earlier in the proceedings, let alone one in which the intervenor had previously disclaimed his theory of intervention to obtain dismissal from the suit. See Day v. Apoliona, 505 F.3d 963, 965-966 (C.A.9 2007), Peruta v. County of San Diego, 824 F.3d 919, 941 (C.A.9 2016) (en banc). Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has denied intervention on facts similar to these. In Yniguez v. Arizona, 939 F.2d 727 (1991), the court considered a state attorney general's motion to intervene on appeal to defend the constitutionality of a state law where the attorney general had previously argued for and won a dismissal of the suit against him in the district court. Id., at 729. There, as here, the attorney general sought to intervene after the only remaining state defendant in the case declined to pursue the case further. Id., at 730. The court nonetheless  held that having argued in the district court that he should not be a party, the Attorney General is estopped from now arguing that he should be. Id., at 738. Other Courts of Appeals have similarly held that stipulations entered into by a public official in his official capacity are binding on the official's successors. Morales Feliciano v.

That election undoubtedly explains, as a practical matter, the attorney general's change in position.

Shifts in the political winds do not support a special carveout to longstanding principles of estoppel.

Thompson could not put forth any substantial evidence that would explain why the prosecutor had moved to dismiss the charges or why the trial court had dismissed the charges. Therefore, the District Court ruled that Thompson's criminal case had not ended in a way that affirmatively indicated his innocence. The District Court granted judgment to the defendant officers on that Fourth Amendment claim.

The favorable termination requirement serves multiple purposes: (i) it avoids parallel litigation in civil and criminal proceedings over the issues of probable cause and guilt, (ii) it precludes inconsistent civil and criminal judgments where a claimant could succeed in the tort action after having been convicted in the criminal case, and (iii) it prevents civil suits from being improperly used as collateral attacks on criminal proceedings.

In most American courts that had considered the question as of 1871, the favorable termination element of a malicious prosecution claim was satisfied so long as the prosecution ended without a conviction. As one influential New York decision explained, when the individual was convicted in the suit or proceeding complained of, he could not maintain an action for malicious prosecution. Clark v. Cleveland, 6 Hill 344, 346, n. a (1844). But when the individual was not convicted, the question is, whether the prosecution instituted by the defendant can be said to have been terminated, disposed of, or, as the books usually say, at an end. Id., at 346. The technical prerequisite is only that the particular prosecution  be disposed of in such a manner that it cannot be revived. Id., at 347, Bacon v.

2021-007,49,"On that point, American courts as of 1871 were largely in agreement.

Chapman v. Woods, 6 Blackf. 504, 505-506 (1843). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Tennessee concluded that a suit was proper when the prosecution was at an end. Pharis v. Lambert, 33 Tenn. 228, 232 (1853).",Kavanaugh,0,

Humes, 7 R.I. 535, 537 (1863). But Rhode Island stood as an outlier on that question. The other American courts to consider the issue did not require some affirmative indication of innocence in order for a malicious prosecution tort claim to proceed. The courts simply required that the prosecution ended in the defendant's favor. As Chief Judge Pryor explained in his comprehensive opinion for the Eleventh Circuit in Laskar v.

But the cases and treatises that respondent latches onto addressed  a separate issue—not whether the prosecution had terminated in the defendant's favor, but whether the prosecution had terminated at all. In particular, courts divided over whether a prosecutor's dismissal without discharge by a judge in fact terminated a prosecution. Some courts concluded that a prosecution ended when the prosecutor dismissed the case, even if the court had not yet taken action. See, e.g., Woodman v. Prescott, 66 N.H. 375, 376-377, 22 A. 456 (1890), see also 1 F. Hilliard, The Law of Torts or Private Wrongs 475 (1874), Newell 327-328, Cooley 186.

And in the overwhelming majority of American jurisdictions that had considered the issue as of 1871, a plaintiff alleging malicious prosecution did not need to show that his prosecution had ended with some affirmative indication of innocence.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-007,58,"Because the American tort-law consensus as of 1871 did not require a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution suit to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence, we similarly construe the Fourth Amendment claim under § 1983 for malicious prosecution. Doing so is consistent, moreover, with the values and purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Manuel, 580 U.S., at 370, 137 S.Ct. 911. The question of whether a criminal defendant was wrongly charged does not logically depend on whether the prosecutor or court explained why the prosecution was dismissed. And the individual's ability to seek redress for a wrongful prosecution cannot reasonably turn on the fortuity of whether the prosecutor or court happened to explain why the charges were dismissed. In addition, requiring the plaintiff to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence would paradoxically foreclose a § 1983 claim when the government's case was weaker and dismissed without explanation before trial, but allow a claim when the government's evidence was substantial enough to proceed to trial. That would make little sense. Finally, requiring a plaintiff to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence is not necessary to protect officers from unwarranted civil suits—among other things, officers are still protected by the requirement that  the plaintiff show the absence of probable cause and by qualified immunity.* * *",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-007,59,"In sum, we hold that a Fourth Amendment claim under § 1983 for malicious prosecution does not require the plaintiff to show that the criminal prosecution ended with some affirmative indication of innocence. A plaintiff need only show that the criminal prosecution ended without a conviction. Thompson has satisfied that requirement here. We express no view, however, on additional questions that may be relevant on remand, including whether Thompson was ever seized as a result of the alleged malicious prosecution, whether he was charged without probable cause, and whether respondent is entitled to qualified immunity. On remand, the Second Circuit or the District Court as appropriate may consider those and other pertinent questions.

2021-007,63,"The Court justifies this creation on the ground that malicious prosecution is the common-law tort that is most analogous to an unreasonable seizure claim.

2021-007,69,"The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. And a Fourth Amendment claim based on an unreasonable seizure has two indispensable elements: (i) there must have been a seizure, i.e., an arrest or some other use of `physical force' or a `show of authority' that `in some way restrains the liberty' of a person, Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. ___, ___ 141 S.Ct. 989, 995, 209 L.Ed.2d 190 (2021), and (ii) the seizure must have been unreasonable, which means, in the  case of a full-blown arrest, that the officers making the arrest must have lacked probable cause. District of Columbia v. Wesby, 583 U.S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 577, 585-586, 199 L.Ed.2d 453 (2018).",Alito,0,
2021-007,70,"Malicious prosecution, on the other hand, requires proof that (i) the suit or proceeding was `instituted without any probable cause,' (ii) the `motive in instituting' the suit `was malicious ', and (iii) the prosecution `terminated in the acquittal or discharge of the accused.' Ante, at 1338 (quoting T. Cooley, Law of Torts 180 (1880) (Cooley)), see also Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.S. 357, 378, 137 S.Ct. 911, 197 L.Ed.2d 312 (2017) (ALITO, J., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2021-007,71,"A comparison of the elements of the malicious-prosecution tort with the elements of a Fourth Amendment unreasonable-seizure claim shows that there is no overlap. That is, a plaintiff suing for unreasonable seizure need not prove any of the elements of common-law malicious prosecution, and a plaintiff suing for commonlaw malicious prosecution need not prove any of the elements required to establish an unreasonable seizure.",Alito,0,
2021-007,72,"Start with the elements of an unreasonable-seizure claim. Such a claim does not require proof that there was a prosecution—i.e., a criminal proceeding that is initiated by the filing of charges in the form of a criminal complaint, information, or indictment—while a malicious-prosecution claim obviously requires a prosecution. See, e.g., 1 F. Hilliard, The Law of Torts or Private Wrongs § 2, pp. 413-414 (1866) (Hilliard) (The general principle is laid down, that an action lies for maliciously causing one to be indicted, whereby he is damnified, either in person, reputation, or property (emphasis added)), Cooley 180 (It is a duty which every man owes to every other not to institute proceedings maliciously, which he has no good reason to believe are justified by the facts and the law (emphasis added)), M. Newell, Law of Malicious Prosecution, False Imprisonment, and Abuse of Process § 1, p. 3 (1892) (Newell) (same), see also W. Prosser, Law of Torts 860 (1941) (The interest in freedom from unjustifiable litigation is protected by an action for malicious prosecution (boldface deleted and emphasis added)). A person who is arrested without probable cause may have a viable unreasonable-seizure claim even if he or she is released before any charges are filed.",Alito,0,
2021-007,73,"An unreasonable-seizure claim also does not require malice. The Court has almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent in Fourth Amendment cases. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 737, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011). If a law enforcement officer makes an arrest without probable cause, the arrest is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional even if the officer harbors no ill will for the arrestee. Likewise, if an officer makes an arrest with probable cause, there is no Fourth Amendment violation regardless of the actual motivations of the individual officers involved. Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), see also Cordova v. Albuquerque, 816 F.3d 645, 664 (CA10 2016) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment).",Alito,0,
2021-007,74,"Finally, the validity of an unreasonable-seizure claim is not dependent on the outcome of any prosecution that happens to follow a seizure. A person who is arrested without probable cause but then convicted based on evidence discovered after the arrest is not barred from recovering simply because he or she cannot show a favorable termination to the proceeding. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 389-392, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007), cf. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487, n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (a person  may bring a suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search even if he or she was convicted). Thus, an unreasonable-seizure claim may be shown without proving any of the elements of a common-law malicious-prosecution claim.",Alito,0,
2021-007,75,"Turning now to the elements of malicious prosecution, we see that all of those may be established without proving either of the two elements that the constitutional text and our precedents require in order to establish an unreasonable seizure.",Alito,0,
2021-007,76,"First, the tort of malicious prosecution does not require a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. There are cases in which defendants charged with nonviolent crimes agree to appear for arraignment and are then released pending trial on their own recognizance. These defendants are prosecuted, and they may bring a common-law suit for malicious prosecution if the other elements of that tort can be shown, but they are not seized. See, e.g., 1 Hilliard § 1, at 412 (noting that malicious prosecution may involve injury to the person, as connected with false imprisonment, but is primarily  a wrong to character or reputation), 3 D. Dobbs, The Law of Torts § 586, p. 388 (2011) (the prosecution does not necessarily involve any detention of the plaintiff at all). The term seizure would have to be given a novel and extravagant interpretation in order to reach a defendant awaiting trial on his own recognizance or one who simply receives a summons to appear at trial. Cordova, 816 F.3d at 663 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.).",Alito,0,
2021-007,77,"Second, since a malicious-prosecution claim does not require a seizure, it obviously does not require proof that the person bringing suit was seized without probable cause. The claim does demand proof that the person bringing suit was prosecuted without probable cause, but probable cause at the time of arrest is a different question from probable cause at the time at which a prosecution is initiated.",Alito,0,
2021-007,78,"In light of the differences between these two claims, it is apparent that a Fourth Amendment unreasonable-seizure claim is not analogous to a claim for malicious prosecution. Much more analogous are the common-law torts of false arrest and false imprisonment, which protect against every confinement of the person, including one effected by forcibly detaining someone in the public streets. Wallace, 549 U.S. at 388-389, 127 S.Ct. 1091 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Dobbs, Law of Torts § 41 (describing elements of false imprisonment and false arrest), Restatement (Second) of Torts § 35 (1964) (same).",Alito,0,
2021-007,80,"The Court does not make a serious effort to justify its analogy between unreasonable seizure and malicious prosecution. Instead, the Court largely relies on the fact that most of the Courts of Appeals to consider the question have drawn that analogy, ante, at 1337, but the Court ignores contrary lower court authority. See, e.g., Manuel v. Joliet, 903 F.3d 667, 670 (CA7 2018), Jones v. Clark County, 959 F.3d 748, 776-777 (CA6 2020) (Murphy, J., concurring in part), Pagan-Gonzalez v. Moreno, 919 F.3d 582, 608-617 (CA1 2019) (BARRON, J., concurring). But in any event, we should not decide this important question without independent analysis, and the Court's own cursory analysis is erroneous.",Alito,0,
2021-007,81,"The Court claims that the gravamen of petitioner's Fourth Amendment claim is the same as that of a malicious-prosecution claim: the wrongful initiation of charges without probable cause. Ante, at 1337. But what the Court describes is not a Fourth Amendment violation at all. As  explained, that Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures—not the unreasonable initiation of charges. In fact, the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights neither impose a standard for the initiation of a prosecution nor require a pretrial hearing to weigh evidence according to a given standard. Albright, 510 U.S. at 282, 114 S.Ct. 807 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), see also 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 14.2(a), pp. 329, 331 (4th ed. 2015) (noting that the Constitution does not require screening of the decision to prosecute by some neutral body to ensure some minimal evidence supporting the charge, and the sole constitutional protection is what the Fourth Amendment requires to justify physical restraints).",Alito,0,
2021-007,82,"The Court also says that the initiation of charges must be wrongful, but it is not clear what that means. If that term simply refers to the lack of probable cause, then the Court has failed to capture the gravamen of malicious prosecution because that tort requires not just that the defendant initiated charges without probable cause but also—as the name of the tort suggests—that this was done with malice. See 1 Hilliard § 4, at 416 (want of probable cause is not enough without malice), 1 Newell § 6, at 7 (The plaintiff must show that the defendant acted from malicious motives in prosecuting him). Cf. ante, at 1338, n. 3 (claiming to reserve the question whether the claim requires malice).",Alito,0,
2021-007,83,"If, on the other hand, the Court uses the term wrongful to require malice, then the claim it has endorsed is even more incompatible with the Fourth Amendment, which almost always imposes a purely objective standard. See supra, at 1336-1337.",Alito,0,
2021-007,85,The Court's recognition of a Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution claim has no basis in our precedents.,Alito,0,
2021-007,87,"The Court relies on certain lower court decisions that accepted the strange concept of a Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution claim, but that line of cases developed in large part because of a misunderstanding of the tersely worded plurality opinion in Albright, 510 U.S. 266, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114. See Hernandez-Cuevas v. Taylor, 723 F.3d 91, 99 (CA1 2013) (noting that dicta in Albright led many jurisdictions to recognize a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim). Instead of simply accepting that misreading, we should explain what Albright actually decided and what the plurality said.",Alito,0,
2021-007,88,"In that case, Kevin Albright was arrested and bound over for trial without probable cause. The prosecution was dismissed before trial, and Albright then sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The District Court dismissed his suit, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, and when the case was argued in this Court, the only claim that Albright pressed was that his prosecution without probable cause violated substantive due process. 510, U.S. at 268, 114 S.Ct. 807 (plurality opinion). He did not advance either a Fourth Amendment claim or a malicious-prosecution claim.",Alito,0,
2021-007,89,"This Court affirmed the dismissal of Albright's substantive due process claim, and while no opinion gained majority approval, both the four Justices who joined the plurality opinion and the three justices who concurred in the judgment agreed that substantive due process does not include the right to be free from prosecution without probable cause. Id., at 268, 275, 114 S.Ct. 807 (plurality opinion), id., at 282, 114 S.Ct. 807 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.),  id., at 286, 114 S.Ct. 807 (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment). That is all that Albright actually decided.",Alito,0,
2021-007,90,"The terse plurality opinion did make comments about the Fourth Amendment and malicious prosecution, and those comments have led to confusion in the lower courts.

2021-007,91,"When the plurality commented on the Fourth Amendment, it was addressing Albright's prosecution-without-probable-cause claim, not malicious prosecution. And in connection with the prosecution-without-probable-cause claim, the plurality made the following two points. First, the plurality noted that where a particular Amendment `provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection' against a particular sort of government behavior, `that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing the claims.' Id., at 273, 114 S.Ct. 807. Second, the plurality observed that the Fourth Amendment is the constitutional provision that deals with pretrial deprivations of liberty. Id., at 274, 114 S.Ct. 807.",Alito,0,
2021-007,92,"What this discussion suggested was that if any provision of the Constitution provided a home for Albright's prosecution-without-probable-cause claim, the Fourth Amendment was a better bet than the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. But the plurality did not conclude or even suggest that a prosecution-without-probable-cause claim could be brought under the Fourth Amendment. See id., at 274-275, 114 S.Ct. 807 (expressly declining to express a view on the question). Indeed, the plurality expressly reiterated that the accused is not `entitled to judicial oversight or review of the decision to prosecute,' suggesting instead that the harm to Albright—if any—was that he was not merely charged but also submitted himself to arrest. Id., at 274, 114 S.Ct. 807 (quoting Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975)).",Alito,0,
2021-007,93,"As for malicious prosecution, the plurality did not even hint that such a claim could be brought under the Fourth Amendment. The plurality's only two references to malicious prosecution appeared in the portion of the opinion that set out what had occurred in the lower courts. Footnote 3 recounted that Albright's complaint contained a common-law malicious-prosecution claim but that this claim had been dismissed without prejudice and that this issue was not before the Court. 510 U.S. at 269, n. 3, 114 S.Ct. 807. Footnote 4 then observed that there was an `embarrassing diversity of judicial opinion' in the lower courts as to whether a malicious-prosecution claim was actionable under § 1983, and the footnote added that substantive due process did not furnish the constitutional peg on which to hang such a `tort.' Id., at 270-271, n. 4, 114 S.Ct. 807. But the plurality opinion did not suggest that the Fourth Amendment could provide such a peg, and neither did any other Justice who concurred in the judgment.*  B",Alito,0,
2021-007,94,"Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.S. 357, 137 S.Ct. 911, also provides no support for a Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution claim. There, petitioner Elijah Manuel brought suit under the Fourth Amendment, alleging that he was arrested without probable cause and then held for seven weeks without probable cause after a judge ordered him detained. Id., at 359-360, 137 S.Ct. 911. The Court reasoned that the Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause. Id., at 367, 137 S.Ct. 911. A violation of that prohibition, the Court continued, may occur both before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding and when legal process itself goes wrong—when, for example, a judge's probable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer's false statements. Ibid. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the plaintiff in that case could state a Fourth Amendment claim because the judge's order holding him for trial was not supported by probable cause. Id., at 368, 137 S.Ct. 911.",Alito,0,
2021-007,95,"Although the majority asserts that Manuel authorized Fourth Amendment malicious-prosecution claims, see ante, at 1336-1337, Manuel did no such thing. That decision expressly declined to determine whether (and, if so, how) petitioner's Fourth Amendment claim should resemble the malicious prosecution tort. Id., at 372, n. 10. Indeed, the majority's analysis here is incompatible with the analysis in Manuel, where the gravamen of the wrong was that petitioner was detained in the absence of probable cause. Id., at 367, 137 S.Ct. 911. Manuel thus provides no support for the Court's suggestion that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the initiation of charges without probable cause. Ante, at 1336-1337.",Alito,0,
2021-007,97,"Instead of clarifying the law regarding § 1983 malicious-prosecution claims, today's decision, I fear, will sow more confusion. The Court endorses a Fourth Amendment claim for malicious prosecution that appears to have the following elements: (1) the defendant initiated charges against the plaintiff in a way that was wrongful and without probable cause, (2) the malicious prosecution resulted in a seizure of the plaintiff, and (3) the prosecution must not have ended in conviction. Ante, at 1337, and n. 2. This tort has no precedent in Fourth Amendment law. It is markedly different from the common-law tort of malicious prosecution, and its dimensions are uncertain.",Alito,0,
2021-007,98,"First, it is not clear why this tort requires both a seizure and a prosecution. As noted, the two do not always go together, and if the aim is to permit the victims of malicious prosecution to sue under § 1983, it is not clear why detention should be required. While pretrial detention certainly increases the harm inflicted by a malicious prosecution, such a prosecution can be very damaging even if the victim is never detained. See, e.g., M. Bigelow, The Law of Torts 204 (1875) (a plaintiff may show damage to his person by imprisonment, his reputation by the scandal, or  his property by the expense). The majority's only answer to the question why the claim requires a seizure is that it is housed in the Fourth Amendment, ante, at 1337, n. 2, but that response begs the antecedent question whether the Fourth Amendment houses a malicious-prosecution suit at all.",Alito,0,
2021-007,99,"Second, where the person bringing suit under § 1983 is arrested and then prosecuted, it is not clear whether both the  arrest and the prosecution must have been done without probable cause and without a legitimate law enforcement purpose. An arrest made without probable cause may be followed by a prosecution based on new evidence that clearly establishes probable cause. And by the same token, the evidence that establishes probable cause at the time of arrest may be thoroughly discredited at some point well before the termination of a prosecution.",Alito,0,
2021-007,100,"Third and most important, it is not clear what the Court means when it says that the gravamen of the claim is wrongful initiation of charges without probable cause. Ante, at 1337. Since the Court refers repeatedly to malicious prosecution, one might think that this requires a guilty mental state, but in a footnote, the Court raises the possibility that the constitutional tort it recognizes may require nothing more than the absence of probable cause. See ibid., n. 3.",Alito,0,
2021-007,101,"If that turns out to be so, it is hard to see even the slightest connection between the Court's new tort and common-law malicious prosecution. Malice is the hallmark of a malicious-prosecution claim. Even if a prosecution is brought and maintained without probable cause, a malicious-prosecution claim cannot succeed without proof of malice. See supra, at 1337-1338. And if the Court's new tort has nothing to do with malicious prosecution, what possible reason can there be for borrowing that tort's favorable-termination element?",Alito,0,
2021-007,103,"Instead of creating a new hybrid claim, we should simply hold that a malicious-prosecution claim may not be brought under the Fourth Amendment. Such a holding would not leave a person in petitioner's situation without legal protection. Petitioner brought Fourth Amendment claims against respondents for false arrest, excessive force, and unlawful entry, but after trial a jury ruled against him on all those claims. See App. 142-146. Petitioner could have also sought relief under state law. See, e.g., Cordova, 816 F.3d at 662 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). New York law appears to recognize a malicious-prosecution tort with an element very much like the favorable-termination element that the Court adopts today, see Lanning v.

2021-008,39,"Meng contacted the police, who used the SUV's GPS device to track the Tsarnaevs. When officers found the brothers in Watertown a few hours later, a street battle ensued. Tamerlan fired on the officers with a handgun, while Dzhokhar threw homemade bombs. When Tamerlan's handgun ran out of ammunition, officers subdued him. As they tried to handcuff Tamerlan, Dzhokhar returned to the SUV and sped towards the officers. They evaded the SUV. Tamerlan did not. Dzhokhar ran over Tamerlan and dragged him roughly 30 feet down the road. Tamerlan disentangled from the undercarriage when Dzhokhar rammed a police cruiser before escaping. Tamerlan died soon after from his injuries.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,40,"Dzhokhar abandoned the SUV a few blocks away. He found a covered boat in a nearby backyard. Taking shelter inside, he carved the words stop killing our innocent people, and we will stop into the planking. Id., at 151. He also wrote a manifesto in pencil on the bulkhead of the boat's cockpit justifying his actions and welcoming his expected martyrdom. The next day, the boat's owner found him. Police eventually forced Dzhokhar out of the boat and arrested him.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,42,"A federal grand jury indicted Dzhokhar for 30 crimes, 17 of which were capital offenses. In preparation for jury selection, the parties jointly proposed a 100-question form to screen the prospective jurors. The District Court adopted almost all of them, including many that probed for bias. For  example, some of the District Court's questions asked whether a prospective juror had a close association with law enforcement. Others asked whether a prospective juror had strong feelings about Islam, Chechens, or the several Central Asian regions with which the Tsarnaevs were connected. Still others asked whether the prospective juror had a personal connection to the bombing.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,43,"Several questions also probed whether media coverage might have biased a prospective juror. One question asked if the prospective juror had formed an opinion about the case because of what he had seen or read in the news media. App. to Pet. for Cert. 373a. Others asked about the source, amount, and timing of the person's media consumption. Still another asked whether the prospective juror had commented or posted online about the bombings.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,44,"The District Court did reject one media-related question. The proposed questionnaire had asked each prospective juror to list the facts he had learned about the case from the media and other sources. Concerned that such a broad, unfocused question would cause trouble by producing unmanageable data of minimal value that would come to dominate the entire voir dire, the District Court declined to include it in the questionnaire. App. 480-481. After Dzhokhar objected to the removal, the District Court further explained that the question was too unguided. Id., at 486.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,45,"Recognizing the intense public interest in the case, the District Court summoned an expanded jury pool. In early January 2015, the court called 1,373 prospective jurors for the first round of jury selection. After reviewing their answers to the questionnaire, the court reduced the pool to 256. As jury selection began in earnest, Dzhokhar renewed his request that the court ask each juror about the content of the media he had consumed. The District Court again refused Dzhokhar's blanket request and instead permitted counsel to ask appropriate followup questions about a prospective juror's media consumption based on the answers to questions in the questionnaire or at voir dire. Several times, the court permitted Dzhokhar's attorneys to follow up on a prospective juror's earlier answers with specific questions about what the juror had seen or heard in the news. Over the course of three weeks of in-person questioning, the District Court and the parties reduced the 256 prospective jurors down to 12 seated jurors.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,46,"After the District Court seated the jury, the case went to trial. Dzhokhar did not contest his guilt and the jury thus returned a guilty verdict on all counts. During the sentencing phase, the Government argued that Dzhokhar's crimes warranted the death penalty. Dzhokhar's mitigation theory centered on the idea that Tamerlan masterminded the bombing. According to Dzhokhar, he was not sufficiently culpable to warrant the death penalty because his older brother had pressured him to participate.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,47,"To prove Tamerlan's domineering nature, Dzhokhar sought to introduce hearsay evidence of a crime Tamerlan allegedly had committed years earlier. Specifically, FBI agents investigating the bombings had come to suspect that Tamerlan's friend, Ibragim Todashev, possessed information about an unsolved triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, where a non-Muslim acquaintance of Tamerlan's and two others were found bound, robbed, and murdered with a knife. When agents went to interview Todashev about a month after the bombings, Todashev initially denied any involvement. Yet, when pressed, he told the agents that Tamerlan had hatched  a plan to rob the three Waltham victims of drug proceeds on the night of September 11, 2011. According to Todashev, he and Tamerlan traveled to Waltham, held the men at gunpoint, and duct-taped their hands, feet, and mouths. After taking the money, Tamerlan insisted on killing the three men. According to Todashev, after he disagreed, Tamerlan told him to wait outside while Tamerlan cut their throats with a knife. The agents offered Todashev a pen and paper to write out his confession. Todashev instead attacked the agents, who killed him in self-defense. The FBI later used Todashev's statement to obtain a search warrant for a follow-on search of Tamerlan's car.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,48,"In the lead-up to trial, the prosecution told Dzhokhar's counsel what Todashev had said but did not turn over the recording of the interview or the FBI reports. The prosecution also disclosed that Dias Kadyrbayev, a friend of Dzhokhar's facing federal obstruction charges in connection with the bombing, told the investigators that Dzhokhar knew about Tamerlan's involvement in the murders. Meanwhile, Government analysts found evidence that someone had searched for information about the Waltham murders from Tamerlan's wife's computer a week after they took place. Government investigators also found jihadi propaganda advocating theft from non-Muslim infidels. Id., at 639.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,49,"Before trial, Dzhokhar filed a motion to compel production of the evidence, which the court denied. The Government filed a motion in limine to exclude any reference to the Waltham murders, contending that the evidence was irrelevant, or at least so lacking in probative value and so likely to confuse the issues that the court should exclude it. The District Court granted the Government's motion in limine. As the District Court saw things, the evidence did not show what Tamerlan's role was and, with Todashev dead, no further line of inquiry remained. The available information was without any probative value and would be confusing to the jury and a waste of time. Id., at 650.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,50,"When the sentencing proceedings finished, the jury concluded that Dzhokhar warranted the death penalty for 6 of the 17 death-penalty-eligible crimes, despite Dzhokhar's argument that Tamerlan was more culpable. The District Court accordingly sentenced Dzhokhar to death.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,52,"The Court of Appeals vacated Dzhokhar's capital sentence on two grounds. See 968 F.3d 24, 35 (CA1 2020). First, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court abused its discretion during jury selection by declining to ask every prospective juror what he learned from the media about the case. Id., at 54-62. According to the panel, such questions were required by that court's 1968 decision in Patriarca v. United States, 402 F.2d 314 (CA1 1968), which had mandated this voir dire rule in the exercise of the court of appeals' discretionary supervisory powers, not as a matter of constitutional law. 968 F.3d, at 60. The Court of Appeals ruled that the District Court's failure to comply with Patriarca was an error of law and so an abuse of discretion. 968 F.3d, at 59. Second, the panel held that the District Court abused its discretion when it excluded from sentencing the evidence concerning Tamerlan's possible involvement in the Waltham murders. Id., at 63-73. The panel believed that the evidence was sufficiently probative of Tamerlan's ability to influence Dzhokhar. Id., at 69-70. We granted certiorari, 592 U.

Notorious crimes are almost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention of those informed citizens who are best fitted for jury duty. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 155-156, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1879). A trial court protects the defendant's Sixth Amendment right by ensuring that jurors have no bias or prejudice that would prevent them from returning a verdict according to the law and evidence. Connors v. United States, 158 U.S. 408, 413, 15 S.Ct. 951, 39 L.Ed. 1033 (1895).",Thomas,0,

That is so because a trial judge's appraisal is ordinarily influenced by a host of factors impossible to capture fully in the record, such as a prospective juror's inflection, sincerity, demeanor, candor, body language, and apprehension of duty. Skilling, 561 U.S., at 386, 130 S.Ct. 2896. A trial court's broad discretion in this area includes deciding what questions to ask prospective jurors. See Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 427, 111 S.Ct. 1899 (our own cases have stressed the wide discretion granted to the trial court in conducting voir dire in the area of pretrial publicity).",Thomas,0,

Indeed, when pretrial publicity is at issue, `primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes especially good sense.' Skilling, 561 U.S., at 386, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (quoting Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 427, 111 S.Ct. 1899, alteration in Skilling).

Ibid. (quoting Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 427, 111 S.Ct. 1899). Because conducting voir dire is committed to the district court's sound discretion, there is no blanket constitutional requirement that it must ask each prospective juror what he heard, read, or saw about a case in the media. Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 417, 111 S.Ct. 1899. Instead, as in any case, the district court's duty is to conduct a thorough jury-selection process that allows the judge to evaluate whether each prospective juror is to be believed when he says he has not formed an opinion about the case. Id., at 425, 111 S.Ct. 1899.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,59,"The District Court did not abuse its broad discretion by declining to ask about the content and extent of each juror's media consumption regarding the bombings. The court recognized the significant pretrial  publicity concerning the bombings, and reasonably concluded that the proposed media-content question was unfocused, risked producing unmanageable data, and would at best shed light on preconceptions that other questions already probed. App. 480-481. At voir dire, the court further explained that it did not want to be too tied to a script because every juror is different and had to be questioned in a way that was appropriate to the juror's earlier answers. Id., at 498. The court was concerned that a media-content question had the wrong emphasis, focusing on what a juror knew before coming to court, rather than on potential bias. Id., at 502. Based on years of trial experience, the court concluded that jurors who came in with some prior knowledge would still be able to act impartially and hold the government to its proof. Id., at 502-503.

2021-008,60,"If any doubt remained, the rest of the jury-selection process dispels it. The District Court summoned an expanded jury pool of 1,373 prospective jurors and used the 100-question juror form to cull that down to 256. The questionnaire asked prospective jurors what media sources they followed, how much they consumed, whether they had ever commented on the bombings in letters, calls, or online posts, and, most pointedly, whether any of that information had caused the prospective juror to form an opinion about Dzhokhar's guilt or punishment. The court then subjected those 256 prospective jurors to three weeks of individualized voir dire in which the court and both parties had the opportunity to ask additional questions and probe for bias. Dzhokhar's attorneys asked several prospective jurors what they had heard, read, or seen about the case in the media. The District Court also provided `emphatic and clear instructions on the sworn duty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in open court.' Skilling, 561 U.S., at 388, n. 21, 130 S.Ct. 2896 (quoting Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 564, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976)). The court reminded the prospective jurors that they must be able to decide the issues in the case based on the information or evidence that is presented in the course of the trial, not on information from any other sources, App. 283, an instruction the court gave during voir dire and repeated during the trial. In sum, the court's jury selection process was both eminently reasonable and wholly consistent with this Court's precedents.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,61,"The Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise. As it saw things, its decision nearly 50 years prior in Patriarca had, pursuant to its supervisory authority, required district courts presiding over high-profile cases to ask about the `kind and degree of the prospective juror's exposure to the case or the parties.' 968 F.3d, at 57 (quoting Patriarca, 402 F.2d, at 318, emphasis deleted).

2021-008,62,"It is true that some of our precedents describe a supervisory authority that inheres in federal courts. See, e.g., McNabb v.

For example, supervisory rules cannot conflict with or circumvent a constitutional provision or federal statute. Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 148, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Nor can they conflict with or circumvent a Federal Rule. Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 426, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996). Finally, and most relevant here, lower courts cannot create prophylactic supervisory rules that circumvent or supplement legal standards set out in decisions of this Court. United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 733-737, 100 S.Ct. 2439, 65 L.Ed.2d 468 (1980).",Thomas,0,
2021-008,63,"Payner exemplifies this last limit. There, a Federal District Court asserted supervisory power to suppress illegally seized evidence even when the seizure violated a third party's Fourth Amendment rights, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.

This Court reversed, explaining that its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence had established beyond any doubt that a defendant could not assert a third party's Fourth Amendment injury in order to suppress evidence. Id., at 735, 100 S.Ct. 2439. Were we to accept this use of the supervisory power, the Court reasoned, we would confer on the judiciary discretionary power to disregard the considered limitations of the law it is charged with enforcing.

As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, our cases establish that a reviewing court may set aside a district court's questioning only for an abuse of discretion. See 968 F.3d, at 56. The Court of Appeals declined to apply that settled standard of review. Rather than ask whether media-content questions were necessary in light of the District Court's exhaustive voir dire, the Court of Appeals resurrected Patriarca, handed down a purported legal rule that media-content questions are required in all high-profile cases, and then concluded that the District Court committed a legal error when it failed to comply with that rule. See 968 F.3d, at 57-59. But a court of appeals cannot supplant the district court's broad discretion to manage voir dire by prescribing specific lines of questioning, and thereby circumvent a well-established standard of review.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).",Thomas,0,
2021-008,70,"That conclusion was reasonable and not an abuse of the District Court's discretion. Dzhokhar sought to divert the sentencing jury's attention to a triple homicide that Tamerlan allegedly committed years prior, though there was no allegation that Dzhokhar had any role in that crime. Nor was there any way to confirm or verify the relevant facts, since all of the parties involved were dead. As the District Court explained, there simply was insufficient evidence to describe any participation Tamerlan may have had or tell who played what role, if they played roles. App. 650. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when finding that the evidence lacked probative value, would confuse the jury, and ultimately would be nothing more than a waste of time. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,71,"Dzhokhar and the dissent offer several counterarguments, none of which is convincing. First, Dzhokhar suggests that § 3593(c) violates the Eighth Amendment if its balancing test operates to exclude any relevant mitigating evidence. See Brief for Respondent 17, 31, Tr. of Oral Arg. 85-88. His argument depends on a line of cases rooted in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982),2 which require the sentencer to consider mitigating circumstances when deciding whether to impose the death penalty. Jones v. Mississippi, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1307, 1320, 209 L.Ed.2d 390  (2021). Dzhokhar suggests that a district court violates the Eighth Amendment under these precedents if it excludes any marginally relevant mitigating evidence that fails the § 3593(c) balancing test. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 85-88.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,72,"Our cases do not support Dzhokhar's extreme position. `Lockett and its progeny stand only for the proposition that a State may not cut off in an absolute manner the presentation of mitigating evidence, either by statute or judicial instruction, or by limiting the inquiries to which it is relevant so severely that the evidence could never be part of the sentencing decision at all.' Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 361, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (quoting McKoy v.

We read that principle to coexist with the overarching goal that, above all, capital sentencing must be reliable, accurate, and nonarbitrary. Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 493, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990), accord, California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 541, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987). Thus, our capital sentencing jurisprudence seeks to reconcile these two competing principles—to allow mitigating evidence to be considered and to guide the discretion of the sentencer. Johnson, 509 U.S., at 373, 113 S.Ct. 2658. To effectively reconcile these objectives, we need only conclude that it is consistent with the Eighth Amendment for the Federal Government to channel the sentencer's consideration of a defendant's arguably mitigating evidence so as to limit the relevance of that evidence in any reasonable manner, so long as the Federal Government does not deny the defendant a full and fair opportunity to apprise the sentencer of all constitutionally relevant circumstances. Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461, 498-499, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring).",Thomas,0,
2021-008,73,"Because the States and the Federal Government retain `the traditional authority' to decide that certain types of evidence may have insufficient probative value to justify their admission, they may enact reasonable rules governing whether specific pieces of evidence are admissible.

Moreover, we have expressly held that the Eighth Amendment does not deprive a sovereign of its authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a capital defendant can submit, and control the manner in which it is submitted. Oregon v. Guzek, 546 U.S. 517, 526, 126 S.Ct. 1226, 163 L.Ed.2d 1112 (2006).",Thomas,0,
2021-008,74,"Congress' passage of § 3593(c) falls well within that traditional authority. Section 3593(c) sets up a highly permissive regime that allows criminal defendants to introduce a wide range of normally inadmissible evidence. The statute channels that evidence through an individualized balancing test that affords a capital defendant every reasonable opportunity to place relevant mitigating evidence before the penalty-phase jury. Unlike the statute challenged in Lockett or the sentencer's decision challenged in Eddings, § 3593(c) does not put any category of mitigating evidence beyond the sentencer's purview. Rather, § 3593(c) preserves the traditional gatekeeping function of district court judges to consider and assess specific pieces of relevant evidence in light of its probative value and the risks it poses to the jury's truth-seeking function. The court weighs all proffered evidence to determine whether it will assist the jury in considering any grounds for mitigation.",Thomas,0,

But the District Court considered that argument and rejected it after reasonably explaining that there's just no way of telling who played what role, if they played roles, from the sparse and unreliable information before the court. App. 650. It was as plausible  that Todashev was the bad guy and Tamerlan was the minor actor. Ibid. In other words, the evidence did not tend to show that Tamerlan acted as the leader who pressured Todashev into committing the crime. And it certainly did not show that, almost two years later, Tamerlan led and dominated Dzhokhar in a manner that would mitigate Dzhokhar's guilt.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,77,"Dzhokhar further opines that he might have reduced juror confusion by putting the information before the jury in a streamlined manner. Brief for Respondent 32. But it is important that a reviewing court evaluate the trial court's decision from its perspective when it had to rule rather than indulge in review by hindsight. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 182, n. 6, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). Here, Dzhokhar did not alert the District Court to any possible streamlined approach, instead suggesting that, if the court admitted the Waltham evidence, he would submit additional evidence and possibly seek third-party discovery. Moreover, Dzhokhar could not have unilaterally dictated how the proceeding would progress because the Government would have been permitted to rebut any information received at the hearing with evidence of its own. 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c). So no matter how Dzhokhar presented the evidence, its bare inclusion risked producing a confusing mini-trial where the only witnesses who knew the truth were dead. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to lead the jury into this evidentiary detour.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,78,"Finally, Dzhokhar argues that since the Government apparently considered Todashev's statement to the FBI agents reliable enough to justify its reference in a search warrant affidavit, Todashev's statements were necessarily reliable enough to be presented to the jury as mitigating evidence. See Brief for Respondent 27-28, see also post, at 1046-1047 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (contending that the warrant strongly suggests the District Court abused its discretion). We fail to see why. The District Court here did not sign the warrant or the affidavit. Whatever probable-cause assessment the FBI agent and the Magistrate Judge made, the District Court was free to evaluate the information independently when deciding whether to admit it under § 3593(c). As explained, that evaluation was not an abuse of discretion.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,79,"For its part, the dissent subjects the District Court's decision to exclude the Waltham evidence to a more stringent standard of review and, based on its independent review of the record, would reverse. Post, at 1044-1046. While the dissent acknowledges that district courts enjoy significant discretion when making evidentiary decisions, post, at 1044-1045, it nevertheless argues that the death penalty context here requires us to  scrutinize the District Court's decision with particular judicial care, post, at 1050.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,80,"In doing so, the dissent ignores our traditional standard for appellate review of evidentiary determinations.3 Deference is the hallmark of the abuse-of-discretion review applicable to such decisions. General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 143, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). A reviewing court applying that standard must not substitute its judgment for that of the district court. Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 493, 129 S.Ct. 2579, 174 L.Ed.2d 406 (2009) (BREYER, J., dissenting). Rather, an appellate court must defer to the lower court's sound judgment, so long as its decision falls within its wide discretion, Abel, 469 U.S., at 54, 105 S.Ct. 465, and is not `manifestly erroneous,' Joiner, 522 U.S., at 142, 118 S.Ct. 512 (quoting Spring Co. v. Edgar, 99 U.S. 645, 658, 25 L.Ed. 487 (1879)). Even in the death penalty context, this traditional abuse-of-discretion standard applies.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,81,"Yet here, the dissent proposes to independently reevaluate the District Court's decision to exclude the Waltham evidence under § 3593(c). In particular, the dissent joins Dzhokhar in critiquing the District Court's conclusion that the risk of confusing the jury outweighed the probative value of that evidence. See post, at 1047-1050. The dissent thinks it was the District Court's strongest reason for excluding the evidence, post, at 1047-1048, but it discounts the District Court's conclusion for two reasons. Neither is compelling, especially under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,82,"First, the dissent suggests that because death penalty proceedings are special, district courts should be more hesitant to find a risk of confusion in this context than in others. Post, at 1048. But the dissent identifies nothing in the text of the FDPA to support its position. Congress defined what considerations district courts must balance when making admissibility determinations under § 3593(c), and it chose to define one using a term familiar in the law of evidence—confusing the issues. Compare § 3593(c) with Federal Rule of Evidence 403, see also Mosteller, McCormick on Evidence § 185, at 1119 (noting common law power of the judge to exclude relevant evidence to forestall `confusion of the issues'). Nothing suggests that Congress intended district courts to evaluate that concern differently under the FDPA.",Thomas,0,
2021-008,83,"Second, the dissent points out that district courts sometimes allow the Government  to present evidence of a capital defendant's past bad acts during sentencing proceedings, despite the risk of evidentiary minitrials. See post, at 1049-1050. But many of those cases focused on the defendant's own conduct, not someone else's. See ibid. In such cases, the Government need only put on evidence tending to show that the defendant committed the past bad act. See, e.g., United States v. Umaña, 750 F.3d 320, 348-349 (CA4 2014). Here, the evidentiary showing would be substantially more complex and confusing. No one alleges that Dzhokhar participated in the Waltham murders, and, as the District Court reasonably concluded, the evidence available sheds little light on what role (if any) Tamerlan actually played. See App. 650. To make his point at sentencing, then, Dzhokhar would first have to show, without any surviving witnesses, what role Tamerlan actually played. Then, he would have to establish that he learned of the Waltham crimes before planning the bombings. Finally, he would have to explain how his knowledge of Tamerlan's role in a nearly 2-year-old violent robbery affected his own role in the bombings. Whatever other courts might think about an inquiry into a defendant's own prior bad acts, this District Court reasonably thought that the Waltham murder inquiry risked confusing the jury in these proceedings. We see no basis to disturb that conclusion.",Thomas,0,

2021-008,88,"In this case, the First Circuit asserted supervisory power to impose a procedural rule on the District Court. Because that rule (which required a district court to ask media-content questions on request in high-profile prosecutions) conflicts with our cases (which hold that a district court has broad discretion to manage jury selection), I agree with the Court that the First Circuit erred.",Barrett,0,
2021-008,89,"I write separately to note my skepticism that the courts of appeals possess such supervisory power in the first place. Article III's grant of the judicial Power imbues each federal court with the inherent authority to regulate its own proceedings. U. S. Const., Art. III, § 1, Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (It has long been understood that `certain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution,' powers `which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others' (quoting United States v. Hudson, 11 U.S. 32, 7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812))). This authority permits federal courts to handle a range of matters, big and small, that fall in the gaps of governing statutes and formally adopted procedural rules. See, e.g., Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (a district court can dismiss a case sua sponte for failure to prosecute), Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944) (a court of appeals can vacate its judgment upon discovering fraud). But here, the First Circuit did not adopt a rule regulating its own proceedings—it adopted a blanket rule that all district courts in its jurisdiction must follow on pain of reversal.",Barrett,0,
2021-008,90,"In fairness to the First Circuit, we have suggested that the courts of appeals possess authority to dictate procedural rules for district courts. See, e.g., Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 346, n. 10, 100 S.Ct.",Barrett,0,

But before we go further down this road, we should reexamine the map. Not only have we failed to identify a source for this supposed authority, it is unclear that any exists.",Barrett,0,
2021-008,92,"To be sure, this Court has squarely asserted supervisory power to regulate procedure in lower federal courts. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943). While we have not justified this power either, it has an at least arguable basis: the Constitution's establishment of this Court as supreme, as distinct from the inferior Courts that Congress has discretion to create. Art. III, § 1. Much like the grant of the judicial Power carries with it inherent authority over local procedure, this Court's designation as supreme might carry with it some inherent authority to prescribe procedural rules for inferior federal courts. But see ante, at 1035-1036, n. 1. In the end, this argument might be unsupported by the Constitution's structure and history. Still, the text of Article III makes it plausible.",Barrett,0,
2021-008,93,"Yet whatever the status of this Court's supervisory authority, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find any comparable constitutional hook for such power in the courts of appeals. Nor does any statute grant them this general authority. And while it is tempting to roll supervisory authority into the power of appellate review, the two are analytically distinct. A court engaged in appellate review in this context determines whether a lower court exceeded its inherent authority to make a procedural choice. A court asserting supervisory authority imposes its own procedural choice on the lower court. In other words, supervisory authority is not necessarily a lesser included power of appellate review.",Barrett,0,

Dzhokhar argued that Tamerlan was a highly violent man, that Tamerlan radicalized him, and that Dzhokhar participated in the bombings because of Tamerlan's violent influence and leadership. In support of this argument, Dzhokhar sought to introduce evidence that Tamerlan previously committed three brutal, ideologically inspired murders in Waltham, Massachusetts.

He conceded that he and his older brother Tamerlan planted bombs along the route of the Patriot's Day Marathon and that the bombs killed or injured many innocent people. Given Dzhokhar's concession, his trial focused almost exclusively on sentencing, in particular whether Dzhokhar should receive the death penalty. Dzhokhar argued in mitigation that his conduct was less serious than Tamerlan's and that Tamerlan's radicalizing influence was a major reason that Dzhokhar participated in the bombings. See Sears v.

The murders took place on September 11, 2011, the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and about a year and a half before the Boston Marathon bombings. The evidence relating to the Waltham murders came primarily from FBI agent interviews of Ibragim Todashev, a friend of Tamerlan's. During the FBI interviews, Todashev (who attacked the agents and was killed midinterview) initially denied participating in the murders but later said that he and Tamerlan had committed them.",Breyer,0,

Tamerlan then beat up the dealers and, in an attempt to get more money, threatened to stab them. Todashev also said that Tamerlan insisted on killing the drug dealers (even though Todashev `begged him not to'), and that Todashev, feeling like he had no way out, waited outside the house while Tamerlan slit their throats.

The evidence tended to show that Tamerlan committed these murders for ideological reasons. This is true (though to a lesser degree) even if Tamerlan played a secondary, rather than the primary, role in the Waltham killings. Evidence that Tamerlan participated in (and potentially orchestrated) one set of ideologically motivated murders in 2011 supports the claim that Tamerlan was the violent, radicalizing force behind the ideologically motivated bombings a year and a half later.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,120,2. Corroboration/Reliability,Breyer,0,
2021-008,121,"The Waltham evidence was corroborated and sufficiently reliable to warrant presentation to the jury. Dzhokhar's friend Kadyrbayev said that Dzhokhar believed Tamerlan was involved in the Waltham killings. Kadyrbayev also said that Dzhokhar told him that Tamerlan had committed jihad in Waltham. Relatedly, Tamerlan had al Qaeda propaganda on his computer that advocated stealing money from non-Muslims as a way to support jihadist principles. There was also evidence that a week or so after the Waltham killings, someone ran internet searches on Tamerlan's wife's computer for 3 men killed in Waltham, men kill in Waltham, and tamerlan tsarnaev. App. 590. Tamerlan's wife also confirmed that Tamerlan was close friends with one of the drug dealers, and there was evidence that Tamerlan did not attend that friend's funeral, which some thought strange given their close relationship.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,122,"Further, the Waltham evidence was sufficiently reliable for the Government to conclude (via FBI affidavit) that it helped to establish probable cause that Tamerlan committed the Waltham murders. It was reliable enough for a federal judge to issue a search warrant for Tamerlan's car to look for evidence of those murders. It is of course true, as the majority points out, that the District Court was free to make an independent assessment of the reliability of the evidence. Ante, at 1039-1040. But the fact that both the Government and a federal judge found the evidence sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause  that Tamerlan committed the murders strongly suggests that the District Court here abused its discretion in concluding that the same evidence was so unreliable that Dzhokhar could not use it as mitigating evidence to establish the same proposition. Cf. Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. 237, 243, 133 S.Ct. 1050, 185 L.Ed.2d 61 (2013) (probable cause exists when facts would warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime is present (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted, emphasis added)).",Breyer,0,

2021-008,124,"The Waltham evidence was not simply cumulative of other mitigation evidence. And it was critically important to Dzhokhar's mitigation defense. Apart from the Waltham evidence, the evidence of Tamerlan's aggressive nature and violent tendencies consisted of evidence showing (1) that Tamerlan physically abused his then-girlfriend (later wife), (2) that he twice became disruptive and shouted at an Imam during prayers, (3) that he poked someone in the chest during an argument, (4) that he punched a man in the street after the man said something Tamerlan did not like, (5) that Tamerlan yelled at a local butcher who was selling halal turkey for Thanksgiving, and (6) that Tamerlan was disruptive at his boxing gym. Participation in a robbery and triple murder is much stronger evidence of Tamerlan's violent nature than any of these incidents. Cf. Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 8, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (reversible error where excluded mitigating evidence had greater weight than evidence supporting same mitigating factors).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,125,"Similarly, the evidence introduced to show Tamerlan's influence over Dzhokhar consisted of evidence showing (1) their age difference (Tamerlan was 26 at the time of the bombings, Dzhokhar 19), (2) the fact that Dzhokhar looked up to and followed his older brother, (3) that in the brothers' Chechen culture, Tamerlan, as the older sibling, held a position of authority and superiority vis-à-vis Dzhokhar, (4) that Tamerlan sent Dzhokhar articles containing extremist propaganda, and (5) that Tamerlan traveled to Russia in 2012 as part of an unsuccessful effort to wage jihad. But the Waltham evidence showed (if the jury believed Todashev's account) that Tamerlan had previously exerted such influence over Todashev as to make him an unwilling accomplice to a triple murder. This is much stronger evidence of Tamerlan's capacity to influence than any evidence that the jury heard.",Breyer,0,

As both counsel emphasized during closing argument, the critical mitigation issue was the two brothers' comparative responsibility. Dzhokhar's counsel argued, for example, that if not for Tamerlan, this wouldn't have happened. Dzhokhar would never have done this but for Tamerlan. App. 839-840. The prosecution similarly told the jury that the bulk of Dzhokhar's mitigation case comes down to a single proposition: `His brother made him do it.' Id., at 857. The prosecution also told the jury that it should reject this proposition because Dzhokhar's mitigation evidence merely showed that Tamerlan was loud, bossy, and sometimes lost his temper. Id., at 861, 864. Would the prosecution have made the same argument had the evidence required it to add, and perhaps slit the throats of three people? Cf. Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 753, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990) (erroneous jury instruction reversible error where repeatedly emphasized and argued by prosecution), Skipper, 476 U.S., at 5, n. 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669 (exclusion of evidence reversible  error when evidence related to issue underscored  by the prosecutor's closing argument).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,127,"The prosecution went on to argue that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar were equals, and that it was only once Dzhokhar made the decision to become a terrorist, that Tamerlan was able to go into action. App. 873-874. Would the prosecution have made that same claim in the face of evidence that Tamerlan had taken action a year and a half before the bombings, on the anniversary of 9/11, and that Dzhokhar characterized this action as jihad? The excluded evidence went to the heart of these critical sentencing issues.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,128,4. Jury Confusion,Breyer,0,
2021-008,129,"In my view, the District Court's strongest reason for excluding the Waltham evidence, and the majority's best argument for reversing the Court of Appeals, is that admitting the evidence might have confused the jurors by prompting a minitrial about what actually happened in Waltham and what role Tamerlan played. The Federal Death Penalty Act says that a court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of  confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. § 3593(c). Given the trial judge's discretionary authority to admit or exclude evidence, could the possibility of juror confusion overcome the pro-admission factors I have so far discussed? Two reasons convince me that it could not, and that, concerns about jury confusion notwithstanding, the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the evidence.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,130,"First, death penalty proceedings are special. Unlike evidentiary determinations made in other contexts, a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence during a capital sentencing proceeding is made against the backdrop of a capital defendant's constitutional right to argue against the death penalty. See Tennard, 542 U.S., at 285, 124 S.Ct. 2562 (The Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a capital defendant's mitigating evidence (internal quotation marks omitted)). So, although the Federal Death Penalty Act incorporates some of the features that ordinarily guide a trial judge's discretionary decision to admit or exclude evidence, see Fed. Rule Evid. 403, it also provides a special admissibility standard unique to the capital sentencing context. Specifically, the statute says that information may be presented as to any matter relevant to the sentence, including any mitigating or aggravating factor, regardless of whether that information would be admissible under normal evidentiary rules. § 3593(c) (emphasis added). The statute thus tips the balance in favor of admitting mitigating evidence, even if admission means increasing the length of a proceeding by inviting some minitrials over subsidiary issues. Cf. McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 442, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (1990) (The Constitution requires States to allow consideration of mitigating evidence in capital cases), see also Smith v. Texas, 543 U.S. 37, 44, 125 S.Ct. 400, 160 L.Ed.2d 303 (2004) (per curiam). This weighted scale makes sense in the context of capital proceedings, in a way it would not make sense in run-of-the-mill evidentiary disputes, given that the imposition of death is so profoundly different from all other penalties. Lockett, 438 U.S., at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (plurality opinion). Indeed, because the penalty of death is qualitatively different from all other punishments, there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case. Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (plurality opinion). And a jury's decision to impose the death  penalty is more reliable if it is made after considering relevant mitigation evidence that counsels against imposing such a sentence. See Lockett, 438 U.S., at 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954 (emphasizing the need in capital cases to give independent mitigating weight to aspects of the  circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,131,"At the same time, a trial judge normally can control the presentation of evidence to avoid unwarranted detours and to ensure a trial does not extend beyond reasonable limits. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 105 (court can instruct jury that it may consider evidence for one purpose but not another), Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80, 86-87, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976) (Within limits, the judge  may refuse to allow cumulative, repetitive, or irrelevant testimony, and may control the scope of examination of witnesses (citations omitted)). In the context of capital sentencing, then, concerns about juror waste of time or the risk of confusion are less justifiable bases on which to exclude an entire category of evidence that may have significant mitigating value.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,132,"Second, and perhaps of greater importance, a sampling of other death penalty proceedings indicates that the prosecution often introduces evidence of a defendant's prior criminal behavior in support of the death penalty, including evidence that poses a similar risk of jury confusion. Trial judges admit this evidence under the same admissibility standard that governs the admission of mitigating evidence. See § 3593(c) (governing admissibility of evidence supporting aggravating, as well as mitigating, factors). And trial courts admit this evidence not because the defendant's past criminal behavior is directly relevant to the crime at issue but because it supports an aggravating death-penalty-related factor such as a defendant's risk of future dangerousness. If courts admit evidence of past criminal behavior, unrelated to the crime at issue, to show aggravating circumstances, why should they not do the same to show mitigating circumstances?",Breyer,0,
2021-008,133,"Moreover, capital sentencing courts routinely admit this kind of evidence even if the past criminal behavior did not result in formal charges or convictions (and thus has not been proved to a jury or judge). See, e.g., United States v. Gabrion, 719 F.3d 511, 518 (CA6 2013) (District Court admitted evidence of defendant's likely role in the disappearance (and presumably murder) of three other people), United States v. Runyon, 707 F.3d 475, 504-505 (CA4 2013) (District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of defendant's assault charges that were later dismissed), United States v. Snarr, 704 F.3d 368, 395 (CA5 2013) (District Court admitted evidence that defendant participated in a drive-by shooting and allegedly murdered a man), United States v. Lighty, 616 F.3d 321, 341 (CA4 2010) (District Court admitted evidence that defendant was involved in driveby shooting for which he was never charged), United States v. Brown, 441 F.3d 1330, 1368 (CA11 2006) (District Court admitted evidence that defendant has committed an array of other criminal acts, some but not all of which have resulted in conviction).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,134,"Further, trial courts admit this evidence despite claims that the evidence is not reliable (thus risking minitrials). See, e.g., United States v. Coonce, 932 F.3d 623, 641 (CA8 2019), United States v. Umaña, 750 F.3d 320, 348-349 (CA4 2014), United States v. Hager, 721 F.3d 167, 201 (CA4 2013), United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 323 (CA4 2003).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,135,"The evidentiary showing Dzhokhar attempted to make here was not, as the majority asserts, any more complex or confusing than the evidentiary showing the  Government makes in these situations. Cf. ante, at 1040-1041. To the contrary, just as the Government introduces evidence of a defendant's prior unproved bad conduct to show a defendant's dangerousness, so too did Dzhokhar seek to introduce evidence of Tamerlan's prior unproved bad conduct to show Tamerlan's dangerousness. The fact that the evidence was about Tamerlan's character instead of Dzhokhar's did not render the evidence beyond the jury's ability to comprehend. The District Court implicitly recognized as much when it allowed Dzhokhar to introduce other evidence of Tamerlan's past conduct —conduct in which Dzhokhar did not participate.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,136,"Indeed, this Court has rejected concerns that distracting minitrials should preclude the Government from introducing evidence about a nondefendant third party to show aggravation. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 823, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (rejecting reasoning that victim impact evidence should be excluded from sentencing proceeding because it would create a mini-trial on the victim's character (internal quotation marks omitted)). Why then should the same concern preclude a defendant from introducing similar evidence in mitigation? After all, the Government, unlike a defendant, has no constitutional right to present evidence during a capital sentencing proceeding. Cf. Tennard, 542 U.S., at 285, 124 S.Ct. 2562 (The Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a capital defendant's mitigating evidence (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,137,"I conclude, then, that the reasons the District Court gave do not justify excluding the Waltham murder evidence, and it was an abuse of discretion to do so. Nor was the exclusion harmless. See § 3595(c)(2)(C) (death sentence can be vacated if Government fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an error was harmless). Dzhokhar conceded his guilt. The only issue was whether he deserved to die. Tellingly, the jury's nuanced verdict reflected close attention to the relationship between the brothers: The jury did not recommend the death penalty for the charges related to the actions Dzhokhar took together with Tamerlan, and only recommended death for the charges related to the actions Dzhokhar took alone. The Waltham evidence supported Dzhokhar's theory that Tamerlan's violent and radicalizing influence induced all of the actions Dzhokhar took in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings. This evidence may have led some jurors to conclude that Tamerlan's influence was so pervasive that Dzhokhar did not deserve to die for any of the actions he took in connection with the bombings, even those taken outside of Tamerlan's presence. And it would have taken only one juror's change of mind to have produced a sentence other than death, even if a severe one. See § 3593(e) (death verdict must be unanimous).",Breyer,0,
2021-008,139,"Three courts including this Court have now examined this record with care. Why? Why are appellate courts so deeply involved in what is, after all, a trial-based evidentiary matter? The reason, in my view, lies in part in the nature of the underlying proceeding. It is a death penalty proceeding. And where death is at stake, the courts (and Congress) believe that particular judicial care is required. See § 3593 (detailing unique procedures applicable to the special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death is justified (boldface omitted)), Cf. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 422, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (Our duty to search for constitutional error with painstaking care is never more exacting than it is in a capital case (internal quotation  marks omitted)), Zant, 462 U.S., at 885, 103 S.Ct. 2733 (The severity of the death sentence mandates careful scrutiny in the review of any colorable claim of error), Gregg, 428 U.S., at 187, 96 S.Ct. 2909 (joint opinion) (When a defendant's life is at stake, the Court has been particularly sensitive to insure that every safeguard is observed), Glossip v.

That same care applies on abuse-of-discretion review, just as it does for any other standard. The extra time that close examination takes is part of the procedural price that a judicial system allowing the death penalty will inevitably exact.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,141,"I have written elsewhere about the problems inherent in a system that allows for the imposition of the death penalty. See, e.g., id., at 909-938, 135 S.Ct. 2726. This case provides just one more example of some of those problems.",Breyer,0,
2021-008,143,"In my view, the Court of Appeals was correct in its Waltham evidence conclusion. For that reason, the District Court should conduct a new sentencing proceeding. I need not, and do not, reach the pretrial publicity question. I note, however, that when considering that issue, the Court refers to the power of the federal appeals courts to promulgate supervisory rules. See ante, at 1035-1036. Like the Court (and Justice BARRETT), I recognize that the Government does not challenge the general existence of the Court of Appeals' supervisory power. Ibid., n. 1. I would add that our precedents clearly recognize the existence of such a power. See, e.g., Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 146, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985) (It cannot be doubted that the courts of appeals have supervisory powers that permit, at the least, the promulgation of procedural rules governing the management of litigation), United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (In the exercise of supervisory powers, federal courts may, within limits, formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the Constitution or the Congress). I would also add that our review of rules adopted by the courts of appeals pursuant to this power is limited in scope. Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U.S. 234, 244, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993). And I do not find that surprising. A degree of authority for the courts of appeals, closer to the fray, to issue at least some supervisory rules facilitates the flexibility needed in our geographically dispersed multicircuit system.* * *",Breyer,0,

The reduction is not triggered, though, by payments based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service.

The formula is progressive in that it awards lower earners a higher percentage of their earnings. (Think of it like an income tax that lets you keep more of your 1st dollar earned than your 10,000th.) But the formula originally did not count earnings from jobs exempt from Social Security taxes, so it calculated artificially low earnings for retirees who spent part of their careers in those jobs. As a result, those retirees received an artificially high percentage of their calculated earnings in Social Security benefits—plus, in many cases, payments from separate pensions to boot.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,28,"Congress responded to this windfall by modifying the formula to reduce benefits when a retiree receives such a separate pension payment.

As its name suggests, this rare bird has characteristics of two different statuses. On one hand, the dual-status technician is a civilian employee engaged in organizing, administering, instructing, training, or maintenance and repair of supplies to assist the National Guard. § 10216(a)(1)(C), 32 U.S.C. §§ 709(a)(1)-(2). On the other, the technician is required as a condition of that employment to maintain membership in the National Guard and must wear a uniform while working. 10 U.S.C. § 10216(a)(1)(B), 32 U.S.C. §§ 709(b)(2)-(4).",Barrett,0,

From 2009 to 2014, he worked for a private employer flying helicopters.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,33,"After retiring, Babcock applied to the Social Security Administration for benefits. The agency granted his application but  determined that his civil-service pension payments, which he received for his work as a civilian technician, triggered the windfall elimination provision. So the agency applied the modified formula to reduce his Social Security benefits by about $100 per month. Babcock sought reconsideration, arguing that his pension payments fell within the uniformed-services exception and so should not trigger this reduction in benefits. The agency denied reconsideration, and an Administrative Law Judge and the agency's Appeals Council upheld the decision.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,34,"Babcock then sued in federal court. The District Court upheld the agency's decision. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Babcock's civil-service pension payments were based on service in a civilian capacity and therefore did not fall within the uniformed-services exception. Babcock v. Commissioner of Social Security, 959 F.3d 210 (2020). While most circuits to address the question have reached the same result, one has come out the other way.2 We granted certiorari to resolve the split. 592 U. S. ___ (2021).",Barrett,0,
2021-009,36,"Babcock argues that the agency and courts below erred in reducing his Social Security benefits based on his pension for technician employment. The dispute is narrow: All agree that Babcock's separate military pension for his National Guard service does not trigger the windfall elimination provision. And all agree that Civil Service Retirement System pensions generally do trigger that provision. The only question is whether Babcock's civil-service pension for technician work avoids triggering the provision's reduction in benefits because it falls within the exception for a payment based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service. 42 U.S.C. § 415(a)(7)(A)(III). The answer depends on whether Babcock's technician work was service as a member of the National Guard. See § 410(m) (defining member of a uniformed service to include a member of a reserve component as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 101(27), which includes the Army National Guard of the United States).3",Barrett,0,

And the role, capacity, or function in which a technician serves is that of a civilian, not a member of the National Guard. The statute defining the technician job makes that point broadly and repeatedly: For purposes of this section and any other provision of law, a technician is a civilian employee, assigned to a civilian position and authorized and accounted for as a civilian. 10 U.S.C. §§ 10216(a)(1), (a)(1)(C), (a)(2).",Barrett,0,
2021-009,38,"This statute's plain meaning becomes even more apparent when viewed in the broader statutory context. FCC v. AT&T  Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 407, 131 S.Ct. 1177, 179 L.Ed.2d 132 (2011). While working in a civilian capacity, technicians are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. See 10 U.S.C. §§ 802(a)(3)(A)(ii), 12403, 12405. They possess characteristically civilian rights to seek redress for employment discrimination and to earn workers' compensation, disability benefits, and compensatory time off for overtime work. See 32 U.S.C. § 709(f)(5), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16, 5 U.S.C. §§ 8101 et seq., 8337(h), 8451, 32 U.S.C. § 709(h). And, as particularly significant in the context of retirement benefits, technicians hired before 1984 are members of the civil service entitled to pensions under Title 5 of the U. S. Code, which governs the pay and benefits of civil servants. See 5 U.S.C. § 2101. These provisions demonstrate that Congress consistently distinguished technician employment from National Guard service.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,39,"That distinction holds true even though Babcock also served at other times in a different capacity as a member of the National Guard. His civil-service pension payments are not based on that service, for which he received separate military pension payments that do not trigger the windfall elimination provision. Nor are we moved by Babcock's argument that the statutory requirement for technicians to maintain National Guard membership makes all of the work that they do count as Guard service. A condition of employment is not the same as the capacity in which one serves. If a private employer hired only moonlighting police officers to be security guards, one would not call that employment service as a police officer. So too here: the fact that the Government hires only National Guardsmen to be technicians does not erase the distinction between the two jobs.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,40,"Babcock protests that the distinction is not meaningful. He argues that the word as may sometimes bear the looser meaning in the likeness of or the same as, rather than in the capacity of. Reply Brief 4-5. With this looser meaning of as, the uniformed-services exception would apply to a payment based wholly on service in the likeness of or the same as a member of a uniformed service. The technician job satisfies this functional test, Babcock says, because whatever its classification, the job's qualifications, duties, and dress code render it indistinguishable from National Guard service. According to Babcock, Congress' choice to designate the technician's work as civilian is irrelevant to the uniformed-services exception. Brief for Petitioner 3.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,41,"We are unpersuaded. To begin with, the only reason Babcock advances for choosing his functional interpretation of as is that Congress used the word capacity (or the arguably analogous status) in other provisions and did not do so in the uniformed-services exception. See, e.g., 32 U.S.C. § 101(19) (status as a member), 10 U.S.C. § 723(a) (employment in a capacity). But these scattered provisions do not create the kind of stark contrast that might counsel adoption of a meaning other than the most natural one. Cf. Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U.S. 586, 595, 130 S.Ct. 2521, 177 L.Ed.2d 91 (2010). At most, they illustrate that Congress has employed several variations on the same theme to distinguish between service in different capacities.",Barrett,0,
2021-009,42,"More importantly, though, Babcock's functional test is inconsistent with the choices that Congress made in the statutory scheme. Determining whether Babcock's technician employment was service as a member of the National Guard does not turn on factors like whether he wore his uniform to work. It turns on how Congress classified the job—and as already discussed, Congress classified dual-status  technicians as civilian. Babcock dismisses that distinction as one drawn for purposes of administrative bookkeeping, but bookkeeping matters when it comes to pay and benefits.* * *",Barrett,0,

Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 182 L.Ed.2d 272 (2012), this Court explained that ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel is cause to forgive procedural default of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, but only if the State required the prisoner to raise that claim for the first time during state postconviction proceedings.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,35,"Often, a prisoner with a defaulted claim will ask a federal habeas court not only to consider his claim but also to permit him to introduce new evidence to support it. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the standard to expand the state-court record is a stringent one. If a prisoner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, a federal court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the prisoner satisfies one of two narrow exceptions, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)(A), and demonstrates that the new evidence will establish his innocence by clear and convincing evidence, § 2254(e)(2)(B). In all but these extraordinary cases, AEDPA bars evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings initiated by state prisoners. McQuiggin v.

Ramirez, 178 Ariz. 116, 119, 121, 871 P.2d 237, 240, 242 (1994). Ramirez stabbed Mary Ann 18 times in the neck with a pair of scissors, and Candie 15 times in the neck with a box cutter. Id., at 121, 871 P.2d at 242. Police also found physical evidence that Ramirez had raped Candie, and Ramirez later admitted that he had sex with the child on the night of the murders and four times before. Ibid. A jury convicted Ramirez of two counts of premeditated firstdegree murder. Ibid.

2021-010,41,"Ramirez then filed his first petition for state postconviction relief. That petition raised myriad claims, but it did not raise the one at issue here: that Ramirez's trial counsel provided ineffective assistance for failing to conduct a complete mitigation investigation or obtain and present available mitigation evidence at sentencing. App. 402. Ramirez did not raise this ineffective-assistance claim until he subsequently filed a successive state habeas petition, which the state court summarily denied as untimely under Arizona law. See ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,42,"Ramirez also petitioned the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. As relevant here, the District Court held that Ramirez had procedurally defaulted his ineffective-assistance claim by failing to raise it before the Arizona courts in a timely fashion. See App. 402-403. Ramirez responded that the District Court should forgive the procedural default because his state postconviction counsel was himself ineffective for failing to raise the trial-ineffective-assistance claim and develop the facts to support it.",Thomas,0,

Like the District Court, it held that Ramirez's state postconviction counsel's failure to raise and develop the trial-ineffective-assistance claim was cause to forgive the procedural default. See id., at 1247-1248. The Ninth Circuit also held that Ramirez's underlying trial-ineffective-assistance claim was substantial, and that Ramirez therefore had suffered prejudice. See id., at 1243-1247. But, unlike the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined to decide the merits of Ramirez's claim. The court remanded the case for further factfinding because, in its view, Ramirez was entitled to evidentiary development to litigate the merits of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.

A jury convicted Jones of sexual assault, three counts of child abuse, and felony murder. Ibid.

2021-010,49,"Jones next filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The District Court held that Jones' trial-ineffective-assistance claim was procedurally defaulted, so Jones, like Ramirez, invoked his postconviction counsel's ineffective assistance as grounds to forgive the default. Ibid. To bolster his case for cause and prejudice, Jones also moved to supplement the undeveloped state-court record. Ibid. The District Court held a 7-day evidentiary hearing with more than 10 witnesses  and ultimately decided to forgive Jones' procedural default. See id., at 1219, 1225-1226.

Here, two of those costs are particularly relevant.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,59,"First, a federal order to retry or release a state prisoner overrides the State's sovereign power to enforce societal norms through criminal law. Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 556, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is so because habeas relief frequently costs society the right to punish admitted offenders. Engle, 456 U.S. at 127, 102 S.Ct. 1558, see also Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1547, 1554, 209 L.Ed.2d 651 (2021) (When previously convicted perpetrators of violent crimes go free merely because the evidence needed to conduct a retrial has become stale or is no longer available, the public suffers, as do the victims). Only with real finality can the victims of crime move forward knowing the moral judgment will be carried out. Calderon, 523 U.S. at 556, 118 S.Ct. 1489. To unsettle these expectations is to inflict a profound injury to the powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty, an interest shared by the State and the victims of crime alike. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,60,"Second, federal intervention imposes significant costs on state criminal justice systems. It disturbs the State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, Harrington, 562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770 (internal quotation marks omitted), and undermines the States' investment in their criminal trials. If the state trial is merely a `tryout on the road' to federal habeas relief, that detracts from the perception of the trial of a criminal case in state court as a decisive and portentous event. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,62,"In light of these significant costs, we have recognized that federal habeas review cannot serve as a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal. Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102-103, 131 S.Ct. 770. The writ of habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy that guards only against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems. Id., at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 633-634, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). To ensure that federal habeas corpus retains its narrow role, AEDPA imposes several limits on habeas relief, and we have prescribed several more. See, e.g., Brown, 596 U.S., at ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1523-1524. And even if a prisoner overcomes all of these limits, he is never entitled to habeas relief. He must still persuade a federal habeas court that law and justice require it. Id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1524 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,63,"As relevant here, both Congress and federal habeas courts have set  out strict rules requiring prisoners to raise all of their federal claims in state court before seeking federal relief. First, AEDPA requires state prisoners to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State before seeking federal habeas relief. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A). Ordinarily, a state prisoner satisfies this exhaustion requirement by raising his federal claim before the state courts in accordance with state procedures. See O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 848, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). If he does so, a federal habeas court may hear his claim, but its review is highly circumscribed. In particular, the federal court may review the claim based solely on the state-court record, see Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 180, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011), and the prisoner must demonstrate that, under this Court's precedents, no fairminded jurist could have reached the same judgment as the state court, Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770, see § 2254(d).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,64,"State prisoners, however, often fail to raise their federal claims in compliance with state procedures, or even raise those claims in state court at all. If a state court would dismiss these claims for their procedural failures, such claims are technically exhausted because, in the habeas context, state-court remedies are  `exhausted' when they are no longer available, regardless of the reason for their unavailability. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). But to allow a state prisoner simply to ignore state procedure on the way to federal court would defeat the evident goal of the exhaustion rule. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 732, 111 S.Ct. 2546. Thus, federal habeas courts must apply an important `corollary' to the exhaustion requirement: the doctrine of procedural default. Davila, 582 U.S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2064. Under that doctrine, federal courts generally decline to hear any federal claim that was not presented to the state courts consistent with the State's own procedural rules. Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 453, 120 S.Ct. 1587, 146 L.Ed.2d 518 (2000).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,65,"Together, exhaustion and procedural default promote federal-state comity. Exhaustion affords States an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners' federal rights, Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 3, 102 S.Ct. 18, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981) (per curiam), and procedural default protects against the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect state procedural rules, Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546. Ultimately, it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without giving an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation, Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 70 S.Ct. 587, 94 L.Ed. 761 (1950), and to do so consistent with their own procedures, see Edwards, 529 U.S. at 452-453, 120 S.Ct. 1587.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,67,"Despite the many benefits of exhaustion and procedural default, and the substantial costs when those doctrines are not enforced, we have held that a federal court is not required to automatically deny unexhausted or procedurally defaulted claims. When a claim is unexhausted, the prisoner might have an opportunity to return to state court to adjudicate the claim. See, e.g., Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 520, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). When a claim is procedurally defaulted, a federal court can forgive the default and adjudicate the claim if the prisoner provides an adequate excuse. Likewise, if the state-court record for that defaulted claim  is undeveloped, the prisoner must show that factual development in federal court is appropriate.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,69,"Out of respect for finality, comity, and the orderly administration of justice, Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, 388, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed.2d 659 (2004), federal courts may excuse procedural default only if a prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546. To establish cause, the prisoner must show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). Then, to establish prejudice, the prisoner must show not merely a substantial federal claim, such that `the errors at  trial created a possibility of prejudice, but rather that the constitutional violation worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage.' Id., at 494, 106 S.Ct. 2639 (quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982)).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,70,"With respect to cause, attorney ignorance or inadvertence cannot excuse procedural default. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546. The attorney is the petitioner's agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). That said, if the procedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that responsibility for the default be imputed to the State. Murray, 477 U.S. at 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639. That is not because a constitutional error is so bad that the lawyer ceases to be an agent of the prisoner, but rather because a violation of the right to counsel must be seen as an external factor to the prisoner's defense. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 754, 111 S.Ct. 2546 (internal quotation marks omitted). It follows, then, that in proceedings for which the Constitution does not guarantee the assistance of counsel at all, attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse a default. Davila, 582 U.S., at ___, 137 S.Ct. at 2065.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,71,"In Martinez, this Court recognized a narrow exception to the rule that attorney error cannot establish cause to excuse a procedural default unless it violates the Constitution. 566 U.S., at 9, 132 S.Ct. 1309. There, the Court held that ineffective assistance of state postconviction counsel may constitute cause to forgive procedural default of a trial-ineffective-assistance claim, but only if the State requires prisoners to raise such claims for the first time during state collateral proceedings. See ibid. One year later, in Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.S. 413, 133 S.Ct. 1911, 185 L.Ed.2d 1044 (2013), this Court held that this narrow exception applies if the State's judicial system effectively forecloses direct review of trial-ineffective-assistance claims. Id., at 428, 133 S.Ct. 1911. Otherwise, attorney error where there is no right to counsel remains insufficient to show cause. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 16, 132 S.Ct. 1309.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,73,"There is an even higher bar for excusing a prisoner's failure to develop the state-court record. Shortly before AEDPA, we held that a prisoner who negligently failed to develop the state-court record must satisfy Coleman's cause-and-prejudice standard before a federal court can hold an evidentiary hearing. Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 1715, 118 L.Ed.2d 318 (1992). In Keeney, we  explained that little could be said for holding a habeas petitioner to one standard for failing to bring a claim in state court and excusing the petitioner under another, lower standard for failing to develop the factual basis of that claim in the same forum. Id., at 10, 112 S.Ct. 1715. And, consistent with Coleman, we held that evidentiary development would be inappropriate where the cause asserted is attorney error. 504 U.S. at 11, n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 1715.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,74,"Four years later, Congress enacted AEDPA and replaced Keeney's cause-and-prejudice standard for evidentiary development with the even more stringent requirements now codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2). Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (Michael Williams). Section 2254(e)(2) provides that, if a prisoner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, a federal court may hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim in only two limited scenarios. Either the claim must rely on (1) a new and previously unavailable rule of constitutional law made retroactively applicable by this Court, or (2) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence. §§ 2254(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii). If a prisoner can satisfy either of these exceptions, he also must show that further factfinding would demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that no reasonable factfinder would have convicted him of the crime charged. § 2254(e)(2)(B). Finally, even if all of these requirements are satisfied, a federal habeas court still is not required to hold a hearing or take any evidence. Like the decision to grant habeas relief itself, the decision to permit new evidence must be informed by principles of comity and finality that govern every federal habeas case. Cf. Brown, 596 U.S., at ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1523-1524.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,75,"Even though AEDPA largely displaced Keeney, § 2254(e)(2) retained one aspect of Keeney's holding. Michael Williams, 529 U.S. at 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479. Namely, § 2254(e)(2) applies only when a prisoner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim. We interpret fail, consistent with Keeney, to mean that the prisoner must be at fault for the undeveloped record in state court. 529 U.S. at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479. A prisoner is at fault if he bears responsibility for the failure to develop the record. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,77,"Respondents concede that they do not satisfy § 2254(e)(2)'s narrow exceptions. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals forgave respondents' failures to develop the state-court record because, in its view, they each received ineffective assistance of state postconviction counsel.

But under AEDPA and our precedents, state postconviction counsel's ineffective assistance in developing the state-court record is attributed to the prisoner.",Thomas,0,

And, because there is no constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings, see Davila, 582 U.S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2065, a prisoner ordinarily must bear responsibility for all attorney errors during those proceedings, Michael Williams, 529 U.S. at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479.

First, in Keeney, material facts had not been adequately developed in the state postconviction court, apparently due to the negligence of postconviction counsel. 504 U.S. at 4, 112 S.Ct. 1715 (citation omitted). We required the prisoner to demonstrate cause and prejudice to forgive postconviction counsel's deficient performance, see id., at 11, 112 S.Ct. 1715, and recognized that counsel's negligence, on its own, was not a sufficient cause, see id., at 10, n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 1715.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,83,"Second, in Michael Williams, we confirmed that the opening clause of § 2254(e)(2) codifies Keeney's threshold standard of diligence, so that prisoners who would have had to satisfy Keeney's cause-and-prejudice test  are now controlled by § 2254(e)(2). 529 U.S. at 434, 120 S.Ct. 1479. In other words, because Keeney held a prisoner responsible for state postconviction counsel's negligent failure to develop the state-court record, the same rule applied under § 2254(e)(2). For that reason, a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim, as § 2254(e)(2) requires, is not established unless there is lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner's counsel. 529 U.S. at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479 (emphasis added). We then applied that rule and held that state postconviction counsel's failure to investigate  in anything but a cursory manner triggered the opening clause of § 2254(e)(2). Id., at 439-440, 120 S.Ct. 1479.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,84,"Third, in Holland v. Jackson, 542 U.S. 649, 124 S.Ct. 2736, 159 L.Ed.2d 683 (2004) (per curiam), we again held a prisoner responsible for state postconviction counsel's negligent failure to develop the state-court record. Seven years after the prisoner's conviction, and after he had already been denied state postconviction relief, the prisoner found a new witness to provide impeachment testimony. See id., at 650-651, 124 S.Ct. 2736. The prisoner claimed that he discovered the witness so late because state postconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance. Id., at 653, 124 S.Ct. 2736. Citing Coleman and Michael Williams, we rejected the prisoner's claim. Attorney negligence, we held, is chargeable to the client and precludes relief unless the conditions of § 2254(e)(2) are satisfied. 542 U.S. at 653, 124 S.Ct. 2736.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,85,"In sum, under § 2254(e)(2), a prisoner is at fault even when state postconviction counsel is negligent. In such a case, a federal court may order an evidentiary hearing or otherwise expand the state-court record only if the prisoner can satisfy § 2254(e)(2)'s stringent requirements.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,87,"Respondents dispute none of this. Instead, they rely almost exclusively on Martinez's holding that ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel can be cause to  forgive procedural default of a trial-ineffective-assistance claim if a State forecloses direct review of that claim, as Arizona concededly does. See 566 U.S., at 9, 132 S.Ct. 1309. Respondents contend that where, per Martinez, a prisoner is not responsible for state postconviction counsel's failure to raise a claim, it makes little sense to hold the prisoner responsible for the failure to develop that claim. Thus, respondents propose extending Martinez so that ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel can excuse a prisoner's failure to develop the state-court record under § 2254(e)(2).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,88,"Congress foreclosed respondents' proposed expansion of Martinez when it passed AEDPA. Martinez decided that, in the exercise of our equitable judgment and discretion, it was appropriate to modify the rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to excuse a procedural default. Id., at 13, 132 S.Ct. 1309. Such exceptions to procedural default are judge-made rules that we may modify only when necessary. Dretke, 541 U.S. at 394, 124 S.Ct. 1847. Here, however, § 2254(e)(2) is a statute that we have no authority to amend. Where Congress has erected a constitutionally valid barrier to habeas relief, a court cannot decline to give it effect. McQuiggin, 569 U.S. at 402, 133 S.Ct. 1924 (Scalia, J., dissenting), see also Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court). For example, in McQuiggin, we explained that we have no power to layer a miscarriage-of-justice or actual-innocence exception on top of the narrow limitations already included in § 2254(e)(2). See 569 U.S. at 395-396, 133 S.Ct. 1924 (majority opinion).",Thomas,0,
2021-010,89,"The same follows here. We have no power to redefine when a prisoner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings. § 2254(e)(2). Before AEDPA, Keeney held that attorney error during state postconviction proceedings was not cause to excuse an undeveloped state-court record. 504 U.S. at 11, n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 1715. And, in Michael Williams, we acknowledged that § 2254(e)(2) raised the bar Keeney imposed on prisoners who were not diligent in state-court proceedings, 529 U.S. at 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479, while reaffirming that prisoners are responsible for attorney error, see id., at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479. Yet here, respondents claim that attorney error alone permits a federal court to expand the federal habeas record. That result makes factfinding more readily available than Keeney envisioned pre-AEDPA and ignores Michael Williams' admonition that counsel's failure to perform as a diligent attorney triggers the opening clause of § 2254(e)(2). 529 U.S. at 439-440, 120 S.Ct. 1479. We simply cannot square respondents' proposed result with AEDPA or our precedents.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,90,"Respondents propose that Congress may have actually invited their judicial update. According to respondents, Martinez explained that Coleman left open whether ineffective assistance of state postconviction counsel might one day be cause to forgive procedural default, at least in an initial-review collateral proceeding, Martinez, 566 U.S. at 5, 132 S.Ct. 1309, where state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction, Coleman, 501 U.S. at 755, 111 S.Ct. 2546. Respondents contend that Congress might have enacted § 2254(e)(2) with the expectation that this Court one day would open that door.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,91,"We do not agree. First, given our frequent recognition that AEDPA limited rather than expanded the availability of habeas relief  it is implausible that, without saying so, Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 119, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 168 L.Ed.2d 16  (2007), Congress intended this Court to liberalize the availability of habeas relief generally, or access to federal factfinding specifically. Second, in Coleman, we reiterated that counsel's ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent constitutional violation, and surmised that a hypothetical constitutional right to initial-review postconviction counsel could give rise to a corresponding claim for cause. 501 U.S. at 755, 111 S.Ct. 2546, see also Martinez, 566 U.S. at 8-9, 132 S.Ct. 1309. Since then, however, we have repeatedly reaffirmed that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings. See, e.g., Davila, 582 U.S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2065.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,92,"We also reject respondents' equitable rewrite of § 2254(e)(2) because it lacks any principled limit. This Court's holding in Martinez addressed only one kind of claim: ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See 566 U.S., at 9, 132 S.Ct. 1309. We limited our holding in that way to reflect our equitable judgment that trial-ineffective-assistance claims are uniquely important. Id., at 12-13, 132 S.Ct. 1309. Respondents propose that we similarly should permit factual development under § 2254(e)(2) only for trial-ineffective-assistance claims. But § 2254(e)(2) applies whenever any state prisoner failed to develop the factual basis of a claim, § 2254(e)(2) (emphasis added), without limitation to any specific claim. There would be no reason to limit respondents' reconstruction of § 2254(e)(2) as they propose. Unlike for procedural default, we lack equitable authority to amend a statute to address only a subset of claims. Thus, if a prisoner were not at fault under § 2254(e)(2) simply because postconviction counsel provided ineffective assistance, Michael Williams, 529 U.S. at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479, the prisoner's blamelessness necessarily would extend to any claim that postconviction counsel negligently failed to develop. Not even Martinez sweeps that broadly.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,93,"Finally, setting aside that we lack authority to amend § 2254(e)(2)'s clear text, Martinez itself cuts against respondents' proposed result. Martinez was unusually explicit about the narrowness of our decision. Trevino, 569 U.S. at 431, 133 S.Ct. 1911 (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting). The Court left no doubt that the rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 16, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (emphasis added). This aggressively limiting language was not simply a customary nod to the truism that we decide only the case before us. Trevino, 569 U.S. at 432, 133 S.Ct. 1911 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). It was instead an important part of the Court's holding. Ibid. In short, Martinez foreclosed any extension of its holding beyond the narrow exception to procedural default at issue in that case. 566 U.S., at 9, 132 S.Ct. 1309.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,94,"To be sure, Martinez recognized that state prisoners often need evidence out-side the trial record to support their trial-ineffective-assistance claims. Id., at 13, 132 S.Ct. 1309. But Martinez did not prescribe largely unbounded access to new evidence whenever postconviction counsel is ineffective, as respondents propose. Rather, Martinez recognized our overarching responsibility to ensure that state-court judgments are accorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federalism. Id., at 9, 132 S.Ct. 1309. In particular, the Court explained that its holding  ought not to put a significant strain on state resources, because a State faced with the question whether there is cause for an apparent default  may answer that the defaulted claim is wholly  without factual support. Id., at 15-16, 132 S.Ct. 1309. That assurance has bite only if the State can rely on the state-court record. Otherwise, federal habeas courts would routinely be required to hold evidentiary hearings to determine whether state postconviction counsel's factfinding fell short. Murray, 477 U.S. at 487, 106 S.Ct. 2639.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,95,"The cases under review demonstrate the improper burden imposed on the States when Martinez applies beyond its narrow scope. The sprawling evidentiary hearing in Jones is particularly poignant. Ostensibly to assess cause and prejudice under Martinez, the District Court ordered a 7-day hearing that included testimony from no fewer than 10 witnesses, including defense trial counsel, defense postconviction counsel, the lead investigating detective, three forensic pathologists, an emergency medicine and trauma specialist, a biomechanics and functional human anatomy expert, and a crime scene and bloodstain pattern analyst. See 943 F.3d at 1219, 1225-1226. Of these witnesses, only one of the forensic pathologists and the lead detective testified at the original trial. See id., at 1223-1225. The remainder testified on virtually every disputed issue in the case, including the timing of Rachel Gray's injuries and her cause of death. See id., at 1226-1228. This wholesale relitigation of Jones' guilt is plainly not what Martinez envisioned.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,97,"Martinez aside, respondents propose a second reading of § 2254(e)(2) that supposedly permits consideration of new evidence in their habeas cases. Their interpretation proceeds in two steps. First, respondents argue that because § 2254(e)(2) bars only an evidentiary hearing on the claim, a federal court may hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there is cause and prejudice. In respondents' view, a so-called Martinez hearing is not a hearing on the claim. § 2254(e)(2) (emphasis added). Second, with that evidence admitted for cause and prejudice, respondents contend that the habeas court may then consider the new evidence to evaluate the merits of the underlying ineffective-assistance claim. By considering already admitted evidence, respondents reason, the habeas court is not holding a hearing that § 2254(e)(2) otherwise would prohibit. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,98,"There are good reasons to doubt respondents' first point, but we need not address it because our precedent squarely forecloses the second. In Holland, we explained that § 2254(e)(2)'s restrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary hearing. 542 U.S. at 653, 124 S.Ct. 2736 (emphasis deleted). The basis for our decision was obvious: A contrary reading would have countenanced an end-run around the statute. Federal habeas courts could have accepted any new evidence so long as they avoided labeling their intake of the evidence as a hearing. Therefore, when a federal habeas court convenes an evidentiary hearing for any purpose, or otherwise admits or reviews new evidence for any purpose, it may not consider that evidence on the merits of a negligent prisoner's defaulted claim unless the exceptions in § 2254(e)(2) are satisfied.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,99,"Respondents all but concede that their argument amounts to the same kind of evasion of § 2254(e)(2) that we rejected in Holland. They nonetheless object that Holland renders many Martinez hearings a nullity, because there is no point in developing a record for cause and prejudice if a federal court cannot later consider that evidence on the merits. While we agree that any such Martinez hearing would serve no purpose, that is a reason to dispense  with Martinez hearings altogether, not to set § 2254(e)(2) aside. Thus, if that provision applies and the prisoner cannot satisfy its stringent requirements, Michael Williams, 529 U.S. at 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479, a federal court may not hold an evidentiary hearing—or otherwise consider new evidence—to assess cause and prejudice under Martinez.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,100,"This follows from our decision in Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). There, we held that a federal court, in deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, must consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove  factual allegations that would entitle him to federal habeas relief. Id., at 474, 127 S.Ct. 1933. This approach makes eminent sense, for if district courts held evidentiary hearings without first asking whether the evidence the petitioner seeks to present would satisfy AEDPA's demanding standards, they would needlessly prolong federal habeas proceedings. Cullen, 563 U.S. at 208-209, 131 S.Ct. 1388 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). Here, holding a Martinez hearing when the prisoner cannot satisfy AEDPA's demanding standards in § 2254(e)(2) would prolong federal habeas proceedings with no purpose. 563 U.S. at 209, 131 S.Ct. 1388 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). And because a federal habeas court may never needlessly prolong a habeas case, ibid., particularly given the essential need to promote the finality of state convictions, Calderon, 523 U.S. at 555, 118 S.Ct. 1489, a Martinez hearing is improper if the newly developed evidence never would entitle the prisoner to federal habeas relief, Schriro, 550 U.S. at 474, 127 S.Ct. 1933.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,102,"Ultimately, respondents' proposed expansion of factfinding in federal court, whether by Martinez or other means, conflicts with any appropriately limited federal habeas review. In our dual-sovereign system, federal courts must afford unwavering respect to the centrality of the trial of a criminal case in state court. Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 90, 97 S.Ct. 2497. That is the moment at which society's resources have been concentrated in order to decide, within the limits of human fallibility, the question of guilt or innocence of one of its citizens. Ibid., see also Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 416, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993), Davila, 582 U.S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2066. Such intervention is also an affront to the State and its citizens who returned a verdict of guilt after considering the evidence before them. Federal courts, years later, lack the competence and authority to relitigate a State's criminal case.",Thomas,0,
2021-010,103,"The dissent contends that we overstate the harm to States that would result from allowing prisoners to develop evidence outside § 2254(e)(2)'s narrow exceptions. Post, at 1748-1749. Not so. Serial relitigation of final convictions undermines the finality that is essential to both the retributive and deterrent functions of criminal law. Calderon, 523 U.S. at 555, 118 S.Ct. 1489, see also Engle, 456 U.S. at 126-127, and n. 32, 102 S.Ct. 1558. Further, broadly available habeas relief encourages prisoners to `sandbag' state courts by selecting a few promising claims for airing on state postconviction review, while reserving others for federal habeas review should state proceedings come up short. Murray, 477 U.S. at 492, 106 S.Ct. 2639, see also Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 89, 97 S.Ct. 2497. State prisoners already have a strong incentive to save claims for federal habeas proceedings in order to avoid the highly deferential standard of review that applies to claims properly  raised in state court. See § 2254(d), Harrington, 562 U.S. at 105, 131 S.Ct. 770. Permitting federal factfinding would encourage yet more federal litigation of defaulted claims.* * *",Thomas,0,

The Court's decision will leave many people who were convicted in violation of the Sixth Amendment to face incarceration or even execution without any meaningful chance to vindicate their right to counsel.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,108,"In reaching its decision, the Court all but overrules two recent precedents that recognized a critical exception to the general rule that federal courts may not consider claims on habeas review that were not raised in state court. Just 10 years ago, the Court held that a federal court may consider a habeas petitioner's substantial claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel (a trial-ineffectiveness claim), even if not presented in state court, if the State barred the petitioner from asserting that claim until state postconviction proceedings, and the petitioner's counsel in those proceedings was also ineffective. See id., at 17, 132 S.Ct. 1309, see also Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.S. 413, 429, 133 S.Ct. 1911, 185 L.Ed.2d 1044 (2013). Martinez and Trevino establish that such a petitioner is not at fault for any failure to bring a trial-ineffectiveness claim in state court. Despite these precedents, the Court today holds that such a petitioner is nonetheless at fault for the ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel in developing the evidence of trial ineffectiveness in state court. The Court instead holds that a petitioner in these circumstances, having received ineffective assistance of trial and postconviction counsel, is barred from developing such evidence in federal court.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,109,"This decision is perverse. It is illogical: It makes no sense to excuse a habeas petitioner's counsel's failure to raise a claim altogether because of ineffective assistance in postconviction proceedings, as Martinez and Trevino did, but to fault the same petitioner for that postconviction counsel's failure to develop evidence in support of the trial-ineffectiveness claim. In so doing, the Court guts Martinez's and Trevino's core reasoning. The Court also arrogates power from Congress: The Court's analysis improperly reconfigures the balance Congress struck in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) between state interests and individual constitutional rights.",Sotomayor,0,

The State argued that Rachel died as a result of an injury she sustained while in Jones' care. Jones' trial counsel failed to undertake even a cursory investigation and, as a result, did not uncover readily available medical evidence that could have shown that Rachel sustained her injuries when she was not in Jones' care. Having heard none of this evidence, the jury convicted Jones and the trial judge sentenced him to death.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,115,"Jones filed for postconviction review in Arizona state court. Under Arizona law, Jones was not permitted to argue on direct appeal that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance, accordingly, state postconviction review was his first opportunity to raise his trial-ineffectiveness claim. See State v. Spreitz, 202 Ariz. 1, 3, 39 P.3d 525, 527 (2002). At this stage, however, Jones was met with another egregious failure of counsel. Arizona state law sets minimum qualifications that attorneys must meet to be appointed in capital cases like Jones', but the Arizona Supreme Court waived those requirements in Jones' case, and the state court appointed postconviction counsel who lacked those qualifications. See Jones v. Ryan, 327 F.Supp.3d 1157, 1214 (D.Ariz. 2018) (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-4041 (2019)). Jones' new counsel conducted almost no investigation outside of the evidence in the trial record. In short, Jones' postconviction counsel failed to investigate the ineffective assistance of Jones' trial counsel. Counsel moved for the appointment of an investigator, but did so under the wrong provision of Arizona law. The motion was denied. Counsel ultimately filed a petition for postconviction relief that failed to advance any argument that Jones' trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the State's medical evidence. Arizona courts denied the petition. See ante, at 1729-1730.",Sotomayor,0,

The District Court concluded that Jones' postconviction counsel had rendered ineffective assistance in failing to raise this claim in state postconviction proceedings and therefore held that Jones could raise it for the first time in federal court under Martinez. The District Court also relied on this evidence to hold, on the merits, that Jones received ineffective assistance at trial. The court found that there was a reasonable probability that the jury would not have unanimously convicted Jones of any of the counts if Jones' trial counsel had adequately investigated and presented medical and other expert testimony to rebut the State's theory of Jones' guilt. 327 F.Supp.3d at 1211.",Sotomayor,0,

The District Court denied the motion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.

In support of his claim, Ramirez submitted evidence from family members, whom trial counsel and state postconviction counsel had never contacted, revealing the depths of abuse and neglect Ramirez experienced as a child and the life-long manifestations of his possible disability. The evidence showed that Ramirez grew up eating on the floor and sleeping on dirty mattresses in houses filthy with animal feces, that Ramirez's mother would beat him with electrical cords, and that Ramirez displayed multiple apparent developmental delays, including delayed walking, potty training, and speech and inability to maintain basic hygiene or to use utensils to eat.

2021-010,124,"Martinez and Trevino afford habeas petitioners like Jones and Ramirez the opportunity to bring certain trial-ineffectiveness claims for the first time in federal court. The question before the Court is whether Jones and Ramirez can make good on that opportunity by developing evidence in support of these claims, or whether AEDPA nevertheless requires them to rely on the state-court records, constructed by ineffective trial and postconviction counsel, because they failed to develop the factual basis of the ineffective assistance claims in State court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,125,"Under this Court's precedents, the answer is clear. Martinez and Trevino establish that petitioners are not at fault for any failure to raise their claims in state court in these circumstances. Other precedents hold that AEDPA's § 2254(e)(2)'s failed to develop language, too, incorporates a threshold requirement that the petitioner be at fault for not developing evidence. A petitioner cannot logically be faultless for not bringing a claim because of postconviction counsel's ineffectiveness, yet at fault for not developing its evidentiary basis for exactly the same reason.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,127,"This Court's precedents, culminating in Martinez and Trevino, explain the circumstances under which habeas petitioners are deemed accountable for their attorneys' failures to present claims in state court. A petitioner who does not properly present a claim in a state proceeding generally may not raise the claim in federal court, because the claim has been procedurally defaulted. See, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 486, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,128,"A federal court, however, can excuse a procedural default and permit a petitioner to raise a claim for the first time in federal court if the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the procedural default in state court and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law. Maples v. Thomas, 565 U.S. 266, 280, 132 S.Ct. 912, 181 L.Ed.2d 807 (2012) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). This Court has held that cause for a procedural default exists where something external to the petitioner  that cannot fairly be attributed to him impeded his efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,129,"As a general matter, attorney error does not constitute cause to excuse procedural default because courts attribute attorneys' errors to their clients. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). In certain situations, however, attorney error will instead be seen as an external factor and therefore constitute cause. Id., at 754, 111 S.Ct. 2546. In Maples, we held that where an attorney abandoned his client without notice, principles of agency law and fundamental fairness required finding cause to excuse a procedural default, as the petitioner had been disarmed by extraordinary circumstances quite beyond his control. 565 U.S. at 289, 132 S.Ct. 912. In Coleman, we explained that attorney error that constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel similarly demonstrates cause to excuse procedural default in the context of a direct appeal. 501 U.S. at 753-754, 111 S.Ct. 2546. Coleman explained that error that constitutes a violation of petitioner's right to counsel  must be seen as an external factor, i.e., `imputed to the State' because the Sixth Amendment places the burden of guaranteeing effective assistance of counsel on the State. Id., at 754, 111 S.Ct. 2546.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,130,"Coleman left unanswered the question whether ineffective assistance of counsel at the postconviction stage, where defendants generally do not have a constitutional right to counsel, could also constitute cause to excuse default. See id., at 755, 111 S.Ct. 2546. This question is critical in Arizona and other States that do not allow defendants to raise trial-ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, where individuals are constitutionally entitled to effective counsel, and instead require them to raise these claims for the first time in collateral proceedings, in which this Court has not recognized a constitutional right to counsel.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,131,"Martinez, 566 U.S. 1, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 182 L.Ed.2d 272, held that in these States, postconviction counsel's failure to raise a substantial trial-ineffectiveness claim could constitute cause to excuse a procedural default. The Court observed that where a state collateral proceeding is the first time that a petitioner can press a trial-ineffectiveness claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a prisoner's direct appeal, and constitutes the petitioner's `one and only appeal' as to that claim. Id., at 8, 11, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (quoting Coleman, 501 U.S. at 756, 111 S.Ct. 2546). Because this result was occasioned by the State's deliberate choice to move such claims outside of the direct-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the Court held that the general attorney-attribution rule did not apply where postconviction counsel rendered ineffective assistance, just as it would not if appellate counsel on direct review had done so. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 13-14, 16, 132 S.Ct. 1309. Instead, Martinez held, for a habeas petitioner with a substantial underlying trial-ineffectiveness claim who also has the misfortune of being represented by ineffective postconviction counsel, the failure of postconviction counsel to  raise the trial-ineffectiveness claim is not properly attributable to the petitioner. Id., at 14, 132 S.Ct. 1309.",Sotomayor,0,

Trevino held that where a State does not offer a meaningful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, a defendant whose collateral-review counsel renders ineffective assistance has demonstrated cause to excuse the procedural default of his trial-ineffectiveness claim. 569 U.S. at 428, 133 S.Ct. 1911.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,134,"There is no dispute here that respondents' trial-ineffectiveness claims clear the procedural default hurdle under Martinez and Trevino. The question is whether a habeas petitioner can be faultless for a procedural default under Martinez and nonetheless barred by AEDPA's § 2254(e)(2) from seeking an evidentiary hearing in federal court, subject to exceptions not applicable here, because the petitioner failed to develop the factual basis of the procedurally defaulted claim in State court proceedings.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,135,"Precedent establishes that § 2254(e)(2) incorporates a threshold, fault-based failure to develop standard that must be understood in conjunction with the fault-based reasoning in Martinez. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), this Court examined what it means to have failed to develop the factual basis of a claim under § 2254(e)(2). The Court concluded that this language imposes a fault-based standard, meaning that it erects a bar only to those who bear some responsibility for a lack of evidentiary development in state-court proceedings. The Court acknowledged that fail is sometimes used in a neutral way, not importing fault or want of diligence. Id., at 431, 120 S.Ct. 1479. As a matter of ordinary meaning, however, the Court concluded that fail in § 2254(e)(2) connotes some omission, fault, or negligence. Ibid. The Court explained that a person is not at fault when his diligent efforts to perform an act are thwarted by an external force. Id., at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,136,"Williams found further support for its fault-based reading of failed to develop in pre-AEDPA cases that foreshadowed the language of § 2254(e)(2). Specifically, Williams noted the similarity between the text of § 2254(e)(2) and the language of the Court's decision in Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 1715, 118 L.Ed.2d 318 (1992). The Williams Court reasoned that when it enacted AEDPA, Congress had raised the bar Keeney imposed on prisoners who were not diligent (i.e., those who were at fault) in state-court proceedings. 529 U.S. at 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479 (emphasis added). At the same time, however, the opening clause of § 2254(e)(2) codifies Keeney's threshold standard of diligence. Id., at 434, 120 S.Ct. 1479. Phrased differently, under AEDPA, if there has been no lack of diligence at the relevant stages in the state proceedings, the prisoner has not `failed to develop' the facts under § 2254(e)(2)'s opening clause, and he will be excused from showing compliance with the balance of the subsection's requirements. Id., at 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,137,"The reasoning of Martinez and Trevino applies with equal force to the threshold diligence/fault standard of Keeney, Williams, and § 2254(e)(2). Under Williams, whether petitioners who satisfy Martinez are nevertheless subject to § 2254(e)(2) turns on whether they were at fault for not developing evidence in support of their trial-ineffectiveness claims in state postconviction proceedings. All agree that a habeas petitioner is not at fault when the responsibility for an error is properly imputed to the State or to some other external factor. Martinez cases are among the rare ones in which attorney error constitutes such an external factor. That is because a State's deliberate choice to move trial ineffectiveness claims outside of direct appeal and into postconviction review significantly diminishes prisoners' ability to file such claims. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 13, 132 S.Ct. 1309. There is nothing nefarious about this choice, but it is not without consequences. Ibid. Together, Martinez, Trevino, and Williams demonstrate that when a State both provides a criminal defendant with ineffective trial counsel and decides to remove his trial-ineffectiveness claim from appellate review, postconviction counsel's ineffectiveness cannot fairly be attributed to the defendant, and he therefore has not failed to develop the factual basis of his claim. § 2254(e)(2).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,138,"Any other reading hollows out Martinez and Trevino. Martinez repeatedly recognized that to prove a trial-ineffectiveness claim (or even to show that it is substantial), habeas petitioners frequently must introduce evidence outside of the trial record. See, e.g., 566 U.S. at 13, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (Ineffective-assistance claims often depend on evidence outside the trial record). Ineffective-assistance claims frequently turn on errors of omission: evidence that was not obtained, witnesses that were not contacted, experts who were not retained, or investigative leads that were not pursued. Demonstrating that counsel failed to take each of these measures by definition requires evidence beyond the trial record. See Trevino, 569 U.S. at 413, 133 S.Ct. 1911 (observing that `the inherent nature of most ineffective assistance' claims means that the trial court record will often fail to `contain the information necessary to substantiate' the claim), Brief for Federal Defender Capital Habeas Units as Amici Curiae 4-6. Indeed, the very reason States like Arizona might choose to reserve a trial-ineffectiveness claim for a collateral proceeding is to allow development of the factual basis for the claim. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 13, 132 S.Ct. 1309. To hold a petitioner at fault for not developing a factual basis because of postconviction counsel's ineffectiveness in the Martinez context, however, would be to eliminate altogether such evidentiary development and doom many meritorious trial-ineffectiveness claims that satisfy Martinez. Such a rule is not only inconsistent with the reasoning of Martinez and Trevino but renders those decisions meaningless in many, if not most, cases.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,140,"Applying this interpretation of § 2254(e)(2) here makes clear that Jones and Ramirez are not at fault for their attorneys' failures to develop the state-court record. In Jones' case, the District Court found, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that Jones satisfied the demanding requirements of Martinez: Arizona appointed postconviction counsel who did not meet the minimum qualifications for appointment and who failed to raise a substantial (indeed, meritorious) trial-ineffectiveness claim. In Ramirez's case, too, the Ninth Circuit held that postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate  Ramirez's upbringing (despite clear indications of his disability) and for failing to raise or develop a substantial claim of trial ineffectiveness. The lower courts thus held that both respondents satisfied the demanding requirements of Martinez, holdings that the Court does not question.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,141,"By definition, Jones and Ramirez are not at fault for their state postconviction counsel's failures to develop evidence. Jones and Ramirez acted diligently, but their attorneys' errors, paired with the State's choice of how to structure their review proceedings, constituted external impediments. As a result, Jones and Ramirez have not failed to develop the factual bases of their claims, and AEDPA's § 2254(e)(2), properly interpreted, poses no bar to evidentiary development in federal court.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,143,"Rejecting the teachings of Martinez and Trevino, the Court adopts an irrational reading of § 2254(e)(2). The Court begins with the uncontested proposition that, in the ordinary case, a habeas petitioner `must bear the risk of attorney error.' Ante, at 1733 (quoting Coleman, 501 U.S. at 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546). From there, the Court leaps to the conclusion that a petitioner is at fault for not developing the evidentiary record on a trial-ineffectiveness claim even if that lack of development was the result of his postconviction counsel's ineffective assistance. Ante, at 1733-1734.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,144,"The Court's analysis rests on two fundamental errors. First, the Court eviscerates Martinez and Trevino and mischaracterizes other precedents. Second, the Court relies upon its own mistaken understanding of AEDPA's policies and the state interests at issue, recycling claims rejected by the Martinez Court and ignoring the careful balance struck by Congress. In doing so, the Court gives short shrift to the egregious breakdowns of the adversarial system that occurred in these cases, breakdowns of the type that federal habeas review exists to correct.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,146,"The doctrinal consequence of the Court's distortion of precedent is to render Martinez and Trevino dead letters in the mine run of cases. As explained, those precedents are premised on the understanding that a habeas petitioner is not responsible for a postconviction attorney's ineffective failure to assert a substantial trial-ineffectiveness claim in States that do not offer petitioners a meaningful opportunity to raise such claims on direct appeal. The Court, however, does not grapple with this logic on its own terms. Instead, the Court limits Martinez and Trevino to their facts, emptying them of all meaning in the ordinary case (where, as those precedents explain, a trial-ineffectiveness claim will necessarily rely on evidence beyond the trial record). Tellingly, the Court relies on the dissent in Trevino to support its disregard of these cases' reasoning. See ante, at 1737.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,147,"The Court's analysis also rests on a misplaced view of Williams. The Court fixates on Williams' statement that § 2254(e)(2) raised the bar Keeney imposed on prisoners who were not diligent in state-court proceedings. 529 U.S. at 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479, see ante, at 1736. The Court emphasizes the first part of that statement while ignoring its qualification: that § 2254(e)(2) raised the bar for prisoners who were not diligent. In other words, it is undisputed that the bar for excusing a prisoner's failure to develop the state-court record is an onerous one, ante, at 1733, the question is whether, in this context, a habeas petitioner has failed to develop the record in the first place. Martinez and Trevino make clear that habeas  petitioners in Jones' and Ramirez's position do not lack diligence and are not at fault for the failures of their ineffective trial and postconviction counsel.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,148,"The Court further charges that respondents' interpretation of § 2254(e)(2) lacks any principled limit. Ante, at 1737. Here again, the Court resuscitates a complaint that previously was relegated to a dissent. See Martinez, 566 U.S. at 19, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (No one really believes that the holding of Martinez will remain limited to ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel cases). The complaint is just as unavailing now that it has captured a majority. Respondents' interpretation only affects habeas petitioners raising substantial trial-ineffectiveness claims in the subset of States that limit such claims to postconviction review, just as Martinez did. In that context, postconviction review is a prisoner's one and only appeal of a trial-ineffectiveness claim, Coleman, 501 U.S. at 756, 111 S.Ct. 2546 (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis deleted), and the ineffective assistance of counsel at that stage forecloses review of a crucially important constitutional right. Any assertion that respondents' interpretation of the statute would blow the door open to myriad other claims is hyperbole that this Court, until today, consistently has rejected.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,149,"Finally, the Court finds it implausible that Congress would have considered the threshold diligence inquiry under § 2254(e)(2) to account for the Martinez context. Ante, at 1736-1737. But Congress legislated against the backdrop of Coleman. Coleman, in turn, made clear (decades before Martinez) that in certain circumstances where attorney error could be seen as an external factor, i.e., `imputed to the State,' including the ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, the prisoner would not properly be deemed at fault. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 754, 111 S.Ct. 2546. Moreover, it is not uncommon for Congress to adopt statutory language that incorporates an evolving judicial doctrine, see, e.g., Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 461, 135 S.Ct. 2401, 192 L.Ed.2d 463 (2015), and there is no reason this Court should second-guess Congress' choice to incorporate a judicially created diligence doctrine here.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,151,"Much of the Court's opinion focuses not on the text of § 2254(e)(2), nor on the relevant precedents, but on what the Court views as AEDPA's unyielding purpose: ensuring that federal courts afford unwavering respect to state court criminal proceedings. Ante, at 1739, see also ante, at 1730-1732, 1737-1738, 1738-1739. The Court seriously errs by suggesting that AEDPA categorically prioritizes maximal deference to state-court convictions over vindication of the constitutional protections at the core of our adversarial system.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,152,"It is of course true that AEDPA's rules are designed to ensure that state-court judgments are accorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federalism. Martinez, 566 U.S. at 9, 132 S.Ct. 1309. The enacting Congress, however, did not pursue these aims at all costs. AEDPA does not render state judgments unassailable, but strikes a balance between respecting state-court judgments and preserving the necessary and vital role federal courts play in guarding against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102-103, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 377, 135 S.Ct. 891, 190 L.Ed.2d 763 (2015) (per curiam). Absent that role, what this Court regularly calls the Great Writ hardly would be worthy of the label. See, e.g., Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,153,"The Court today supplants the balance Congress struck with its single-minded focus on finality. In doing so, it overstates the harm to States that would result from allowing petitioners to develop facts in support of Martinez claims. See ante, at 1737. Importantly, Martinez applies only where the underlying claim is one of trial ineffectiveness, and only if a petitioner demonstrates that the claim is substantial. 566 U.S. at 14, 132 S.Ct. 1309. The Court reaches to support its holding by yet again repackaging a dissenter's warning, this time that Martinez would put a significant strain on state resources. Id., at 1737 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Nearly a decade of experience with Martinez, however, has proved this unfounded prediction false. In a 9-year sample of three States (Florida, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina), federal courts adjudicated 1,200 habeas petitions raising Martinez claims. See Brief for Habeas Scholars as Amici Curiae 7-8. These courts held evidentiary hearings in less than two percent of these cases. Ibid. The lower federal courts, in other words, are perfectly capable of policing Martinez's limits. There is no reason to expect that to change from an affirmance here.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,154,"In the same vein, the Court bemoans the sprawling evidentiary hearing conducted by the District Court in Jones' case. Ante, at 1737-1738. Of course, the scope of the District Court's hearing (including evidence from medical experts, forensic experts, law enforcement personnel, and others) was necessary only because trial counsel failed to present any of that evidence during the guilt phase of Jones' capital case. Far from constituting an inappropriate and wholesale relitigation of Jones's guilt, ibid., the District Court's hearing was wide-ranging precisely because the breakdown of the adversarial system in Jones' case was so egregious.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,155,"The Court suggests that evidentiary hearings like Jones' will encourage prisoners to `sandbag' state courts by strategically holding back claims from state postconviction review to present them for the first time in federal court. Ante, at 1739-1740. That claim is odd, particularly in this context. It is a State's decision to divert trial-ineffectiveness claims from direct appeal to postconviction review, and then to provide ineffective postconviction counsel, that results in the failure to raise or develop such claims before state courts. No habeas petitioner or postconviction counsel could possibly perceive a strategic benefit from failing to raise a meritorious trial-ineffectiveness claim in an available forum. Indeed, the whole thrust of Jones' and Ramirez's argument is that their Sixth Amendment claims were so obvious that their state postconviction attorneys were ineffective in failing to assert them.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,156,"On the other side of the ledger, the Court understates, or ignores altogether, the gravity of the state systems' failures in these two cases. To put it bluntly: Two men whose trial attorneys did not provide even the bare minimum level of representation required by the Constitution may be executed because forces outside of their control prevented them from vindicating their constitutional right to counsel. It is hard to imagine a more extreme malfunction, Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (internal quotation marks omitted), than the prejudicial deprivation of a right that constitutes the foundation for  our adversary system, Martinez, 566 U.S. at 12, 132 S.Ct. 1309.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,157,"Nor will the damage be limited to these two cases. Even before Martinez, this Court recognized that a trial record is often incomplete or inadequate to demonstrate inadequate assistance of counsel. Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). A trial record may contain no evidence of alleged errors of omission, like a failure sufficiently to investigate a case. Ibid. For a court to discern whether any alleged error was prejudicial, too, it is obvious that additional factual development may be required. Ibid. The on-the-ground experience of capital habeas attorneys confirms this commonsense notion. See Brief for Federal Defender Capital Habeas Units as Amici Curiae 3-4. The Court's decision thus reduces to rubble many habeas petitioners' Sixth Amendment rights to the effective assistance of counsel.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,158,"Contrary to the Court's account, the fundamental fairness concerns that arise from this particular type of breakdown are not unconditionally eclipsed by the need to accord finality and respect to state-court judgments. Ante, at 1737. Finality interests are at their apex when the essential elements of a presumptively accurate and fair proceeding were present in the proceeding whose result is challenged. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The effective assistance of counsel is one of those essential elements. See Martinez, 566 U.S. at 12, 132 S.Ct. 1309. When the effective assistance of counsel is absent, leaving a severely diminished basis for presuming fairness and accuracy, finality concerns are somewhat weaker. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Neither statute nor precedent supports the Court's assertion that the virtues of finality override fundamental fairness to such a degree that meaningful review of life-ordeath judgments obtained through such deeply flawed proceedings should be foreclosed.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-010,159,"Ultimately, the Court's decision prevents habeas petitioners in States like Arizona from receiving any guaranteed opportunity to develop the records necessary to enforce their Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. For the subset of these petitioners who receive ineffective assistance both at trial and in state postconviction proceedings, the Sixth Amendment's guarantee is now an empty one. Many, if not most, individuals in this position will have no recourse and no opportunity for relief. The responsibility for this devastating outcome lies not with Congress, but with this Court.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

Ibid. The Board further recommended that Mr. Wilson complete additional training relating to governance and ethics. Id., at 44a-45a.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,32,"Shortly after the Board adopted its second resolution, Mr. Wilson amended the pleadings in one of his pending state-court lawsuits, adding claims against HCC and the trustees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Among other things, Mr. Wilson asserted that the Board's censure violated the First Amendment. By way of remedy, he sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages for mental anguish, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,33,"Years of legal twists and turns followed. HCC and the trustees removed the case to federal court. Mr. Wilson then amended his complaint to drop his colleagues from the suit, leaving HCC as the sole defendant. Eventually, HCC moved to dismiss the complaint. The District Court granted the motion, concluding that Mr. Wilson lacked standing under Article III. On appeal, a panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Mr. Wilson had standing and that his complaint stated a viable First Amendment claim. 955 F.3d 490, 496-497 (2020).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,34,"The Fifth Circuit's merits analysis proceeded in two steps. First, the court concluded that a verbal reprimand against an elected official for speech addressing a matter of public concern is an actionable First Amendment claim under § 1983. Id., at 498. Next, the court reasoned that the Board's imposition of other punishments— such as limiting Mr. Wilson's eligibility for officer positions and his access to certain funds—did not violate his First Amendment rights because Mr. Wilson did not have an entitlement to those privileges. Id., at 499, n. 55. In sum, the court held that Mr. Wilson's § 1983 action could proceed, but only as to the Board's unadorned censure resolution. HCC's request for rehearing en banc failed by an equally divided vote. 966 F.3d 341 (CA5 2020).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,35,"In time, HCC filed a petition for certiorari in this Court. It asked us to review the Fifth Circuit's judgment that Mr. Wilson may pursue a First Amendment claim based on a purely verbal censure. Last year, we agreed to take up that question. 593 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2564, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2021). But as merits briefing unfolded, Mr. Wilson did not just seek to defend the Fifth Circuit's judgment, he also sought to challenge it in part. Specifically, he argued that the Fifth Circuit erred to the extent that it upheld the Board's nonverbal punishments as consistent with the First Amendment. Generally, however, when a respondent in this Court seeks to alter a lower court's judgment, he must file and we must grant a cross-petition for review. See Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72, 133 S.Ct. 1523, 185 L.Ed.2d 636 (2013). Mr. Wilson filed no such petition in this case. As a result, we decline to take up his  challenge to the Fifth Circuit's judgment, and the only question before us remains the narrow one on which we granted certiorari: Does Mr. Wilson possess an actionable First Amendment claim arising from the Board's purely verbal censure?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,38,"The First Amendment prohibits laws abridging the freedom of speech. One obvious implication of that rule is that the government usually may not impose prior restraints on speech. See Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 718-720, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931). But other implications follow too. Relevant here, no one before us questions that, as a general matter, the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting individuals to retaliatory actions after the fact for having engaged in protected speech. Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1715, 1722, 204 L.Ed.2d 1 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 256, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006). Mr. Wilson argues that the Board's censure resolution represents exactly that kind of impermissible retaliatory action.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,39,"Almost immediately, however, this submission confronts a challenge. When faced with a dispute about the Constitution's meaning or application, long settled and established practice is a consideration of great weight. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655, 689, 49 S.Ct. 463 (1929). Often, a regular course of practice can illuminate or liquidate our founding document's terms & phrases. Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 8 Writings of James Madison 450 (G. Hunt ed. 1908), see also McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), The Federalist No. 37, p. 229 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). That principle poses a problem for Mr. Wilson because elected bodies in this country have long exercised the power to censure their members. In fact, no one before us has cited any evidence suggesting that a purely verbal censure analogous to Mr. Wilson's has ever been widely considered offensive to the First Amendment.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,40,"As early as colonial times, the power of assemblies in this country to censure their members was more or less assumed. M. Clarke, Parliamentary Privilege in the American Colonies 184 (1943). It seems, too, that assemblies often exercised the power to censure members for views they expressed and actions they took both within and without the legislature. D. Bowman & J. Bowman, Article I, Section 5: Congress' Power to Expel—An Exercise in Self-Restraint, 29 Syracuse L. Rev. 1071, 1084-1085 (1978) (footnote omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,41,"The parties supply little reason to think the First Amendment was designed or commonly understood to upend this practice. To the contrary, the United States Senate issued its first censure in 1811, after a Member read aloud a letter from former President Jefferson that the body had placed under an injunction of secrecy. 22 Annals of Cong. 65-83. The House of Representatives followed suit in 1832, censuring one of its own for insulting  the Speaker. 2 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives § 1248, pp. 799-800 (1907) (Hinds). Ten years later, the House reprimanded another Member after he introduced a resolution thought to be damaging to international relations. Id., § 1256, at 807-808.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,42,"Many later examples followed these early ones. In 1844, the Senate issued a censure after a Member divulged to the New York Evening Post a confidential message from President Tyler outlining the terms of an annexation agreement with  Texas. U. S. Senate Historical Office, A. Butler & W. Wolff, United States Senate: Election, Expulsion, and Censure Cases 1793-1990, p. 47 (1995). During the Civil War, Congress censured several Members for expressing support for the Confederacy. See Hinds § 1253, at 803-804 (censure of Rep. Alexander Long), id., § 1254, at 804-805 (censure of Rep. Benjamin G. Harris). In 1954, the Senate condemned Senator Joseph McCarthy for bringing the Senate into dishonor, citing his conduct and speech both within that body and before the press. 100 Cong. Rec. 16392, see also Butler, United States Senate, at 404-407. The House and Senate continue to exercise the censure power today. See, e.g., Congressional Research Service, J. Maskell, Expulsion, Censure, Reprimand, and Fine: Legislative Discipline in the House of Representatives 20 (2016) (documenting censures in the House through 2016). And, as these examples lay bare, Congress has censured Members not only for objectionable speech directed at fellow Members but also for comments to the media, public remarks disclosing confidential information, and conduct or speech thought damaging to the Nation.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,43,"If anything, censures along these lines have proven more common yet at the state and local level. As early as 1833, Justice Story observed that even the humblest assembly in this country historically enjoyed the power to prescribe rules for its own proceedings. 2 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 835, p. 298. And throughout our history many state and local bodies have employed that authority to prescribe censure processes for their members. See Brief for Petitioner 23-28 (collecting examples). Today, the model manual of the National Conference of State Legislatures contemplates just such procedures too. See Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure § 561.1 (2020). According to HCC and undisputed by Mr. Wilson, it seems elected bodies in this country issued no fewer than 20 censures in August 2020 alone. See Pet. for Cert. 19-21.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,44,"If this longstanding practice does not put at rest the question of the Constitution's meaning for the dispute before us, it surely leaves a considerable impression. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 401. On Mr. Wilson's telling and under the Fifth Circuit's holding, a purely verbal censure by an elected assembly of one of its own members may offend the First Amendment. Yet we have before us no evidence suggesting prior generations thought an elected representative's speech might be abridged by that kind of countervailing speech from his colleagues. U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. Instead, when it comes to disagreements of this sort, history suggests a different understanding of the First Amendment—one permitting free speech on both sides and for every faction on any side. Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 547, 65 S.Ct. 315, 89 L.Ed. 430 (1945) (Jackson, J., concurring).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,46,"What history suggests, we believe our contemporary doctrine confirms. Under this Court's precedents, a plaintiff pursuing a First Amendment retaliation claim must show, among other things, that the government took an adverse action in response to his speech that would not have been taken absent the retaliatory motive. Nieves, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1722. Some adverse actions may be easy to identify—an arrest, a prosecution, or a dismissal from governmental employment. See id., at, ___ _ ____, 139 S.Ct., at 1721-22 (arrest), Hartman, 547 U.S., at 256, 126 S.Ct. 1695 (prosecution), Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 596-597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (employment). Deprivations less harsh than dismissal  can sometimes qualify too. Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 75, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990). At the same time, no one would think that a mere frown from a supervisor constitutes a sufficiently adverse action to give rise to an actionable First Amendment claim.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,47,"To distinguish material from immaterial adverse actions, lower courts have taken various approaches. Some have asked whether the government's challenged conduct would chill a person of ordinary firmness in the plaintiff's position from engaging in future First Amendment activity. Nieves, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1721 (internal quotation marks omitted). Others have inquired whether a retaliatory action adversely affected the plaintiff's  protected speech, taking into account things like the relationship between speaker and retaliator and the nature of the government action in question. Suarez Corp. Industries v. McGraw, 202 F.3d 676, 686 (CA4 2000). But whether viewed through these lenses or any other, it seems to us that any fair assessment of the materiality of the Board's conduct in this case must account for at least two things.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,48,"First, Mr. Wilson was an elected official. In this country, we expect elected representatives to shoulder a degree of criticism about their public service from their constituents and their peers—and to continue exercising their free speech rights when the criticism comes. As this Court has put it, whatever differences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that it was adopted in part to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs. Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218, 86 S.Ct. 1434, 16 L.Ed.2d 484 (1966). When individuals consent to be a candidate for a public office conferred by the election of the people, they necessarily put their character in issue, so far as it may respect their fitness and qualifications for the office. White v. Nicholls, 3 How. 266, 290, 11 L.Ed. 591 (1845).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,49,"Second, the only adverse action at issue before us is itself a form of speech from Mr. Wilson's colleagues that concerns the conduct of public office. The First Amendment surely promises an elected representative like Mr. Wilson the right to speak freely on questions of government policy. But just as surely, it cannot be used as a weapon to silence other representatives seeking to do the same. The right to examine public characters and measures through free communication may be no less than the guardian of every other right. Madison's Report on the Virginia Resolutions (Jan. 7, 1800), in 17 Papers of James Madison 345 (D. Mattern, J. Stagg, J. Cross, & S. Perdue eds. 1991). And the role that elected officials play in that process `makes it all the more imperative that they be allowed to freely express themselves.' Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 781, 122 S.Ct. 2528, 153 L.Ed.2d 694 (2002).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,50,"Given these features of Mr. Wilson's case, we do not see how the Board's censure could qualify as a materially adverse action consistent with our case law. The censure at issue before us was a form of speech by elected representatives. It concerned the public conduct of another elected representative. Everyone involved was an equal member of the same deliberative body. As it comes to us, too, the censure did not prevent Mr. Wilson from doing his job, it did not deny him any privilege of office, and Mr. Wilson does not allege it was defamatory. At least in these circumstances, we do not see how the Board's censure could have materially deterred an elected official like Mr. Wilson from exercising his own right to speak.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,51,"Mr. Wilson's behavior and concessions seem telling. Recall that, after the Board's first reprimand, Mr. Wilson did not exactly cower silently. Indeed, before us Mr. Wilson does not argue that the Board's initial resolution interfered with his free speech rights in any way. Instead, he confines his attack to the Board's second reprimand. And even when it comes to that resolution, he does not quibble with its contents. Mr. Wilson does not suggest, for example, that the Board's criticism of him for inappropriate and reprehensible behavior materially deterred him from speaking his mind. Instead, he submits that the Board's second resolution offended the First Amendment only because it was denominated a disciplinary censure. So on Mr. Wilson's telling, it seems everything hinges on a subtlety: A reprimand no matter how strongly worded does not materially impair the freedom of speech, but a disciplinary censure does. That much we find hard to see. Doubtless, by invoking its censure authority in the second resolution the Board added a measure of sting. But we cannot see how that alone changed the equation and materially inhibited Mr. Wilson's ability to speak freely.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,52,"In rejecting Mr. Wilson's claim, we do not mean to suggest that verbal reprimands or censures can never give rise to a First Amendment retaliation claim. It may be, for example, that government officials who reprimand or censure students, employees, or licensees may in some circumstances materially impair First Amendment freedoms. See generally Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U.S. 136, 139, 114 S.Ct. 2084, 129 L.Ed.2d 118 (1994) (licensing), Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 655-656, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985) (same), Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1268-1269 (CA11 2004) (student), Kirby v. Elizabeth City, 388 F.3d 440, 449 (CA4 2004) (employee). Likewise, we do not address today questions concerning legislative censures accompanied by punishments, or those aimed at private individuals. Cf. Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 189-190, 26 L.Ed. 377 (1881) (distinguishing Congress's power to inflict certain punishments on its own Members from its power to punish nonmembers). Nor do we pass on the First Amendment implications of censures or reprimands issued by government bodies against government officials who do not serve as members of those bodies. See, e.g., Jenevein v. Willing, 493 F.3d 551, 560-561 (CA5 2007), Scott v. Flowers, 910 F.2d 201, 211-213 (CA5 1990).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,53,"History could hold different lessons for cases like these, too. For example, following the Whiskey Rebellion, Federalists supported by President Washington introduced a proposal in Congress to denounce self-created societies they believed had `misrepresented the conduct of the Government.' 4 Annals of Cong. 899 (1794). James Madison and others opposed, and ultimately defeated, the effort in the House of Representatives. In doing so Madison insisted that, in a Republic like ours, the censorial power is in the people over the Government, and not in the Government over the people. Id., at 934, see also R. Chesney, Democratic-Republican Societies, Subversion, and the Limits of Legitimate Political Dissent in the Early Republic, 82 N. C. L. Rev. 1525, 1560-1566 (2004). When the government interacts with private individuals as sovereign, employer, educator, or licensor, its threat of a censure could raise First Amendment questions. But those cases are not this one.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,55,"Mr. Wilson offers a countervailing account of our precedent and history, but all  of it rests on a strained analogy. To start, he directs us to Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116, 87 S.Ct. 339, 17 L.Ed.2d 235 (1966). There, a state legislature refused to seat a duly elected representative. According to the legislature, the representative's comments criticizing the Vietnam War were incompatible with the State's required loyalty oath. This Court held that the legislature's action violated the First Amendment. Id., at 135, 87 S.Ct. 339. And, Mr. Wilson reasons, we must reach the same result here. But that much does not follow quite as seamlessly as Mr. Wilson suggests. The legislature's action in Bond implicated not only the speech of an elected official, it also implicated the franchise of his constituents. And it involved not just counterspeech from colleagues but exclusion from office. See id., at 123-125, 87 S.Ct. 339.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,56,"Just three years after Bond, the Court stressed the salience of these differences. In Powell v. McCormack, the Court held that Congress possesses no power to exclude duly elected representatives who satisfy the prerequisites for office prescribed in Article I of the Constitution. 395 U.S. 486, 550, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). In doing so, however, the Court took pains to emphasize that the power to exclude and the power to issue other, lesser forms of discipline are not fungible under our Constitution. Id., at 512, 89 S.Ct. 1944, see also id., at 551-553, 89 S.Ct. 1944 (Douglas, J., concurring). Mr. Wilson's attempt to analogize his case to Bond thus conflates a distinction Powell cautioned us not to confuse.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,57,"The differences between exclusion and censure also undermine Mr. Wilson's alternative argument—this one concerning John Wilkes. In 1763, Wilkes published an attack on a recent English peace treaty with France, calling it the product of bribery and condemning the Crown's ministers as the tools of despotism and corruption. Powell, 395 U.S., at 527, 89 S.Ct. 1944 (internal quotation marks omitted). Parliament responded by expelling Wilkes from office and later refusing to seat him despite his repeated reelection. Id., at 527-528, 89 S.Ct. 1944. Only in 1782 did Parliament finally relent, voting to expunge its prior resolutions and resolving that its actions had been subversive of the rights of the whole body of electors of this kingdom. Id., at 528, 89 S.Ct. 1944 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,58,"According to Mr. Wilson, the Wilkes affair demonstrates that legislative censures are at odds with the American legal tradition. But, once more, this argument stretches a historical analogy too far. The framers may well have had the Wilkes episode in mind when they crafted Clauses in the Constitution limiting Congress's ability to impose its own ad hoc qualifications for office or to expel Members. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §§ 2-3, 5, see also Powell, 395 U.S., at 531-539, 89 S.Ct. 1944. Undoubtedly, too, the first set of these constitutional limitations ultimately led the Court in Powell to hold that the House of Representatives may not exclude members-elect for general misconduct not within the Constitution's standing qualifications. Id., at 528, 89 S.Ct. 1944. But Mr. Wilson cites nothing in the Wilkes affair to support his much more ambitious suggestion that the founding generation understood the First Amendment to prohibit representative bodies from censuring members as the Board did here. If anything, as we have seen, history counsels a very different conclusion.*",Gorsuch,0,
2021-011,59,"Our case is a narrow one. It involves a censure of one member of an elected body by other members of the same body. It does not involve expulsion, exclusion, or any other form of punishment. It entails  only a First Amendment retaliation claim, not any other claim or any other source of law. The Board's censure spoke to the conduct of official business, and it was issued by individuals seeking to discharge their public duties. Even the censured member concedes the content of the censure would not have offended the First Amendment if it had been packaged differently. Neither the history placed before us nor this Court's precedents support finding a viable First Amendment claim on these facts. Argument and counterargument, not litigation, are the weapons available for resolving this dispute. Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375, 389, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 8 L.Ed.2d 569 (1962).

2021-012,29,"The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., authorizes a party to an arbitration agreement to seek several kinds of assistance from a federal court. Under Section 4, for example, a party may ask the court to compel an arbitration proceeding, as the agreement contemplates. And under Sections 9 and 10, a party may apply to the court to confirm, or alternatively to vacate, an arbitral award.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,30,"Yet the federal courts, as we have often held, may or may not have jurisdiction to decide such a request. The Act's authorization of a petition does not itself create jurisdiction. Rather, the federal court must have what we have called an independent jurisdictional basis to resolve the matter. Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 582, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008).",Kagan,0,

Discover Bank, 556 U.S. 49, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009), we assessed whether there was a jurisdictional basis to decide a Section 4 petition to compel arbitration by means of examining the parties' underlying dispute. The text of Section 4, we reasoned, instructs a federal court to look through the petition to the underlying substantive controversy between the parties—even though that controversy is not before the court. Id., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262. If the underlying dispute falls within the court's jurisdiction—for example, by presenting a federal question—then the court may rule on the petition to compel. That is so regardless whether the petition alone could establish the court's jurisdiction.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,32,"The question presented here is whether that same look-through approach to jurisdiction applies to requests to confirm or vacate arbitral awards under the FAA's Sections 9 and 10. We hold it does not. Those sections lack Section 4's distinctive language directing a lookthrough, on which Vaden rested. Without that statutory instruction, a court may look only to the application actually submitted to it in assessing its jurisdiction.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,34,"This case grows out of the arbitration of an employment dispute. Petitioner Denise Badgerow worked as a financial advisor for REJ Properties, a firm run by respondents Greg Walters, Thomas Meyer, and Ray Trosclair. (For ease of reference, we refer from now on only to Walters.) Badgerow's contract required her to bring claims arising out of her employment to arbitration, rather than to court. So when she was (in her view, improperly) fired, she initiated an arbitration action against Walters, alleging unlawful termination under both federal and state law. The arbitrators sided with Walters, dismissing Badgerow's claims.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,35,"What happened afterward—when Badgerow refused to give up—created the jurisdictional issue we address today. Believing that fraud had tainted the arbitration proceeding, Badgerow sued Walters in Louisiana state court to vacate the arbitral decision. Walters responded by removing the case to Federal District Court—and, once there, applying to confirm the arbitral award. Finally, Badgerow moved to remand the case to state court, arguing that the federal court lacked jurisdiction over the parties' requests—under Sections  10 and 9, respectively—to vacate or confirm the award.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,36,"The District Court assessed its jurisdiction under the look through approach this Court adopted in Vaden v. Discover Bank. See 2019 WL 2611127, *1 (ED La., June 26, 2019). That approach, as just noted, allows a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over an FAA application when the parties' underlying substantive dispute would have fallen within the court's jurisdiction. See supra, at 1314. The District Court acknowledged that Vaden involved a different kind of arbitration dispute: It concerned a petition to compel arbitration under the FAA's Section 4, rather than an application to confirm or vacate an arbitral award under Section 9 or 10. And Vaden's reasoning was grounded on specific text in Section 4 that Sections 9 and 10 do not contain. 2019 WL 2611127, *2. But the court thought it should apply the lookthrough approach anyway, so that consistent jurisdictional principles would govern all kinds of FAA applications. Ibid. And under that approach, the court had jurisdiction because Badgerow's underlying employment action raised federal-law claims. The court thus went on to resolve the dispute over whether fraud had infected the arbitration proceeding. Finding it had not, the court granted Walters's application to confirm, and denied Badgerow's application to vacate, the arbitral award.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,37,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's finding of jurisdiction, relying on a just-issued Circuit precedent. See 975 F.3d 469, 472-474 (2020) (citing Quezada v. Bechtel OG&C Constr. Servs., Inc., 946 F.3d 837, 843 (2020)). In that decision, the Fifth Circuit had echoed the reasoning of the District Court here. Yes, the language of Section 4 directing use of the lookthrough approach is in fact absent in the FAA's other sections. 946 F.3d, at 842. But, the court continued, a principle of uniformity applying to the FAA dictates using the same approach for determining jurisdiction under each section of the statute. Ibid., but see id., at 845-846 (Ho, J., dissenting) (rejecting that asserted principle in favor of fidelity to text). As applied to this case, that analysis meant that the district court had jurisdiction over Walters's Section 9 and Badgerow's Section 10 applications.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,38,"Courts have divided over whether the look-through approach used in Vadencan establish jurisdiction in a case like this one—when the application before the court seeks not to compel arbitration under Section 4 but to confirm, vacate, or modify an arbitral award under other sections of the FAA.1 We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 593 U.

Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Congress has granted those courts jurisdiction over two main kinds of  cases. District courts have power to decide diversity cases—suits between citizens of different States as to any matter valued at more than $75,000. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). And they have power to decide federal-question cases—suits arising under federal law. § 1331. Typically, an action arises under federal law if that law creates the cause of action asserted. Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 257, 133 S.Ct. 1059, 185 L.Ed.2d 72 (2013). So when federal law authorizes the action, the party bringing it—once again, typically—gets to go to federal court.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,41,"But that is not necessarily true of FAA-created arbitration actions. As noted above, the FAA authorizes parties to arbitration agreements to file specified actions in federal court—most prominently, petitions to compel arbitration (under Section 4) and applications to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitral awards (under Sections 9 through 11). See supra, at 1314. But those provisions, this Court has held, do not themselves support federal jurisdiction. See Hall Street, 552 U.S., at 581-582, 128 S.Ct. 1396, Vaden, 556 U.S., at 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262. (Were it otherwise, every arbitration in the country, however distant from federal concerns, could wind up in federal district court.) A federal court may entertain an action brought under the FAA only if the action has an independent jurisdictional basis. Hall Street, 552 U.S., at 582, 128 S.Ct. 1396. That means an applicant seeking, for example, to vacate an arbitral award under Section 10 must identify a grant of jurisdiction, apart from Section 10 itself, conferring access to a federal forum. Vaden, 556 U.S., at 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262. If she cannot, the action belongs in state court. The FAA requires those courts, too, to honor arbitration agreements, and we have long recognized their prominent role in arbitral enforcement. Ibid., see id., at 71, 129 S.Ct. 1262, Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 12-16, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984).2",Kagan,0,
2021-012,42,"The issue here is about where a federal court should look to determine whether an action brought under Section 9 or 10 has an independent jurisdictional basis. An obvious place is the face of the application itself. If it shows that the contending parties are citizens of different States (with over $75,000 in dispute), then § 1332(a) gives the court diversity jurisdiction. Or if it alleges that federal law (beyond Section 9 or 10 itself) entitles the applicant to relief, then § 1331 gives the court federal-question jurisdiction. But those possibilities do Walters no good. He and Badgerow are from the same State. And their applications raise no federal issue. Recall that the two are now contesting not the legality of Badgerow's firing but the enforceability of an arbitral award. That award is no  more than a contractual resolution of the parties' dispute—a way of settling legal claims. See Vaden, 556 U.S., at 63, 129 S.Ct. 1262. And quarrels about legal settlements—even settlements of federal claims—typically involve only state law, like disagreements about other contracts. See Kokkonen, 511 U.S., at 378-382, 114 S.Ct. 1673. So the District Court here, as Walters recognizes, had to go beyond the face of the Section 9 and 10 applications to find a basis for jurisdiction. See Brief for Respondents 26-27. It had to proceed downward to Badgerow's employment action, where a federal-law claim satisfying § 1331 indeed exists. In other words, the court had to look through the Section 9 and 10 applications to the underlying substantive dispute, although that dispute was not before it. Could the court do so?",Kagan,0,
2021-012,43,"In Vaden, this Court approved the lookthrough approach for a Section 4 petition, relying on that section's express language. Under Section 4, a party to an arbitration agreement may petition for an order to compel arbitration in a United States district court which, save for the arbitration agreement, would have jurisdiction over the controversy between the parties.3 That text, we stated, drives our conclusion that a federal court should determine its jurisdiction by `looking through' a § 4 petition to the underlying substantive controversy—to see, for example, if that dispute `arises under' federal law. 556 U.S., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,44,"To show why that is so, we proceeded methodically through Section 4's wording. The phrase `save for the arbitration agreement,' we began, indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the arbitration agreement and determine whether the court `would have jurisdiction ' without it. Ibid. (first alteration in original). But jurisdiction over what? Ibid. The text of Section 4, we continued, refers us to `the controversy between the parties.' Ibid. And that controversy, we explained, could not mean the dispute before the court about the existence or applicability of an arbitration agreement, after all, the preceding save-for clause had just directed courts to assume that agreement away. Id., at 63, 129 S.Ct. 1262. The controversy between the parties instead had to mean their underlying substantive controversy. Id., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (internal quotation marks omitted). Attending to the language of Section 4 thus required approving the `look through' approach as a means of assessing jurisdiction over petitions to compel arbitration. Ibid. The opposite view was not merely faulty, it was textually implausible. Id., at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,45,"But Sections 9 and 10, in addressing applications to confirm or vacate an arbitral award, contain none of the statutory language on which Vadenrelied. Most notably, those provisions do not have Section 4's save for clause. They do not instruct a court to imagine a world without an arbitration agreement, and to ask whether it would then have jurisdiction over the parties' dispute. Indeed, Sections 9 and 10 do not mention the court's subject-matter jurisdiction at all.4 So under  ordinary principles of statutory construction, the look-through method for assessing jurisdiction should not apply. When Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, we generally take the choice to be deliberate. Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1761, 1782, 210 L.Ed.2d 432 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have no warrant to redline the FAA, importing Section 4's consequential language into provisions containing nothing like it. Congress could have replicated Section 4's look-through instruction in Sections 9 and 10. Or for that matter, it could have drafted a global look-through provision, applying the approach throughout the FAA. But Congress did neither. And its decision governs.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,46,"Nothing in that conclusion changes because a jurisdictional question is before us. The federal district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 552, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005). And the jurisdiction Congress confers may not be expanded by judicial decree. Kokkonen, 511 U.S., at 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673. Those bedrock principles prevent us from pulling look-through jurisdiction out of thin air—from somehow finding, without textual support, that federal courts may use the method to resolve various state-law-based, non-diverse Section 9 and 10 applications. The look-through rule is a highly unusual one: It locates jurisdiction not in the action actually before the court, but in another controversy neither there nor ever meant to be. We recognized that rule in Vaden because careful analysis of Section 4's text showed that Congress wanted it applied to petitions brought under that provision. See 556 U.S., at 62-65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. But Congress has not so directed in Sections 9 and 10. Congress has not authorized a federal court to adjudicate a Section 9 or 10 application just because the contractual dispute it presents grew out of arbitrating different claims, turning on different law, that (save for the parties' agreement) could have been brought in federal court. And because a statutory basis for look-through jurisdiction is lacking here, we cannot reach the same result as in Vaden: That would indeed be jurisdictional expansion by judicial decree. Kokkonen, 511 U.S., at 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,47,"Walters contests that view of the statute. Unlike the Courts of Appeals to have adopted his position, including the Fifth Circuit below, see supra, at 1314-1316, he offers a reading of the FAA's text to justify exercising jurisdiction here.5  Walters's argument comes in two parts. First, Walters says, the language in Section 4 that Vaden construed does not in fact authorize the use of the look-through jurisdictional method. In his view, that sentence is only a capacious venue provision, serving to expand venue to the limits of federal jurisdiction (and thus to give an applicant a broad choice among federal courts possessing jurisdiction). Brief for Respondents 12, 23. Second, Walters claims that Section 6 provides the basis for an FAA-wide look-through jurisdictional rule. Under Section 6, any FAA application shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of motions. That provision, Walters claims, requires use of the look-through approach because federal courts have jurisdiction over motions when they have jurisdiction over the underlying action. Brief for Respondents 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). So to recap Walters's theory: Section 4 does not establish any jurisdictional rule for applications to compel in particular, while Section 6 establishes the look-through jurisdictional rule for all kinds of FAA applications.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,48,"But Walters's understanding of Section 4 does not comport with what it says. The language of that provision never mentions venue, it refers only to jurisdiction. That is a signal, sharp and clear, that the section provides a jurisdictional rule. And even suppose (against all odds) that Congress had meant to state the venue rule Walters proposes without ever using the word venue. In that event, Congress could have simply permitted filing the petition in any district court with jurisdiction (or even more simply—because a court can never act without jurisdiction—in any district court). Given that (in Walters's view) the jurisdictional rule comes from another provision, Congress would not have needed to (again) spell out its content. But spelling out the rule's content—by describing the look-through method—is exactly what Section 4 does. That description can serve one purpose only: to establish jurisdiction where it would otherwise not exist.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,49,"And that is how Vaden understood Section 4. Our decision, like the relevant text, never once referred to venue. Instead, we spoke, throughout the opinion, of the way Section 4 provides for jurisdiction. We formulated the question presented as whether the district court could exercise jurisdiction over the party's § 4 petition. 556 U.S., at 53, 129 S.Ct. 1262, see id., at 57, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (stating that we granted certiorari to decide whether district courts could use the look-through method to determine whether federal-question jurisdiction exists over a § 4 petition). And we framed our holding as about jurisdiction: A federal court should determine its jurisdiction by `looking through' a § 4 petition. Id., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262, see id., at 72, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (differing about the rule's application, but agreeing that a court presented with a Section 4 petition should use the look-through method in determining whether it has jurisdiction). In short, Section 4's save for text drove our conclusion not about venue, but about jurisdiction. Id., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262. And so that text, as shown above, contradicts Walters's position—for it appears in Section 4 alone, rather than also in Sections 9 and 10. See supra, at 1317-1318.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,50,"Walters's theory fares no better in construing Section 6's mention of motions to prescribe a look-through rule for the whole FAA. Here, Walters commits the opposite  of his fault in reading Section 4: He now reads a provision containing no express reference to jurisdiction in fact to set out a jurisdictional rule. There may be rare contexts in which courts can, without such a reference, infer that Congress has expanded our jurisdiction—but this is not one. Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U.S. 468, 474, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (plurality opinion). The look-through method, as noted before, is a jurisdictional outlier. See supra, at 1318. For Congress to prescribe it by telling courts, a la Section 6, to treat FAA applications like motions in other kinds of litigation would be not just oblique but simply bizarre. Courts, after all, do not possess jurisdiction to decide ordinary motions by virtue of the look-through method. A motion (unlike a typical FAA application) is part of a case actually in court. Jurisdiction to decide the case includes jurisdiction to decide the motion, there is no need to look through the motion in search of a jurisdictional basis outside the court. And if the look-through rule does not apply to motions, then Section 6's reference to motions cannot direct the look-through rule. We have formerly described that provision's function as something different: Section 6, we said, ensures that FAA applications get streamlined treatment—a kind of expedited review, as compared to what a party would receive if she brought a normal contract suit. Hall Street, 552 U.S., at 582, and n. 3, 128 S.Ct. 1396. However hard we squint, we cannot also discern in Section 6 an FAA-wide look-through rule, the only such rule in the FAA, applying only to petitions to compel, resides in Section 4.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,51,"Walters's more thought-provoking arguments sound not in text but in policy. Here, Walters—now joined by the dissent—preaches the virtues of adopting look-through as a single, easy-to-apply jurisdictional test that will produce sensible results. Brief for Respondents 28 (internal quotation marks omitted), see post, at 1323-1327 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (lauding the advantages of look-through's practical consequences). First, Walters says, a uniform jurisdictional rule, applying to all FAA applications alike, will necessarily promote administrative simplicity because a court will not have to figure out which rule to apply. Brief for Respondents 27. Second, he claims, the look-through rule is easier to apply than a test that would ground jurisdiction on the face of the FAA application itself. Id., at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, he says, the latter approach confronts courts with hard questions about how to determine diversity jurisdiction (including its amount-in-controversy component) across a range of settings—for the Section 9 and 10 applications at issue here, as well as for Section 5 and 7 petitions (obviously not at issue) to appoint arbitrators or compel the presence of witnesses. Id., at 41. (The dissent's vaunted practical advantages also mostly concern avoiding those diversity issues. Post, at 1323-1324, see post, at 1323-1326.)6 Finally, Walters contends that only the look-through rule will provide federal courts with comprehensive control over the arbitration process, including the period after the award. The opposite position, he says, will close the federal courthouse doors to many post-arbitration motions, even when they grow out of disputes raising  exclusively federal claims. Brief for Respondents 37, 46.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,52,"Walters himself quotes back to us the topline answer to those theories, reflecting its obviousness: Even the most formidable policy arguments cannot overcome a clear statutory directive. Id., at 44 (quoting BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1532, 1542, 209 L.Ed.2d 631 (2021), alteration omitted). Walters's (and the dissent's) what-makes-best-sense assertions rest on the view that the FAA contains no such clear directive limiting look-through jurisdiction to Section 4. Brief for Respondents 44-45, see post, at 1327. Having rejected that view, we cannot find much relevance in his ideas, even if plausible, about the optimal jurisdictional rule for the FAA. It is not for this Court to employ untethered notions of what might be good public policy to expand our jurisdiction. Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 161, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). However the pros and cons shake out, Congress has made its call. We will not impose uniformity on the statute's non-uniform jurisdictional rules.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,53,"And anyway, we think Walters oversells the superiority of his proposal. First, uniformity in and of itself provides no real advantage in this sphere. A court can tell in an instant whether an application arises under Section 4 or, as here, under Section 9 or 10, so it can also tell in an instant whether to apply the look-through method or the usual jurisdictional rules. Second, the use of those ordinary rules—most notably, relating to diversity jurisdiction—is hardly beyond judicial capacity. Federal courts have faced, and federal courts have resolved, diversity questions for over two centuries, in diverse and ever-changing legal contexts. Throughout, they have developed workable rules, and we see no reason to think they will do differently here. Indeed, past practice belies Walters's and the dissent's gloomy predictions. Although they spin out hypotheticals designed to make the project look ultra-confusing, they fail to identify any actual problems that have arisen from courts' longstanding application of diversity standards to FAA applications (without using look-through). And Walters's solution does not even avoid the (purported) difficulty of which he complains. For he does not claim (nor could he) that look-through is the exclusive means of establishing federal jurisdiction. Even if the underlying action does not fall within a district court's jurisdiction, the application still might do so—say, because the parties have changed, and are now diverse. See supra, at 1316-1317. So courts, on Walters's own view, will still have to resolve questions about—and develop rules for—determining diversity in the FAA context. The difference is only one of degree—and too small, under any plausible theory of statutory interpretation, to adopt Walters's proposal to rewrite the law.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,54,"Finally, we can see why Congress chose to place fewer arbitration disputes in federal court than Walters wishes. The statutory plan, as suggested above, makes Section 9 and 10 applications conform to the normal—and sensible—judicial division of labor: The applications go to state, rather than federal, courts when they raise claims between non-diverse parties involving state law. See supra, at 1316-1317. As Walters notes, those claims may have originated in the arbitration of a federal-law dispute. But the underlying dispute is not now at issue. Rather, the application concerns the contractual rights provided in the arbitration agreement, generally governed by state law. And adjudication of such state-law contractual rights—as this Court has held in addressing a non-arbitration settlement of federal claims—typically  belongs in state courts. See Kokkonen, 511 U.S., at 381-382, 114 S.Ct. 1673, supra, at 1316-1317. To be sure, Congress created an exception to those ordinary jurisdictional principles for Section 4 petitions to compel. But it is one thing to make an exception, quite another to extend that exception everywhere. See post, at 1326 (disregarding this point). As this Court has often said, the preeminent purpose of the FAA was to overcome some judges' reluctance to enforce arbitration agreements when a party tried to sue in court instead. E.g., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 221, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). We have never detected a similar congressional worry about judges' willingness to enforce arbitration awards already made. So Congress might well have thought an expansion of federal jurisdiction appropriate for petitions to compel alone. Applications about arbitral decisions could and should follow the normal rules.",Kagan,0,
2021-012,55,"The result, as Walters laments, is to give state courts a significant role in implementing the FAA. But we have long recognized that feature of the statute. Enforcement of the Act, we have understood, is left in large part to the state courts. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 25, n. 32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983), see Vaden, 556 U.S., at 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262, Hall Street, 552 U.S., at 582, 128 S.Ct. 1396. As relevant here, Congress chose to respect the capacity of state courts to properly enforce arbitral awards. In our turn, we must respect that evident congressional choice.* * *",Kagan,0,

I consequently dissent.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,61,"The question presented arises in the context of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. The question is technical and jurisdictional: How does a federal court determine whether it has jurisdiction to consider a motion to confirm or vacate an arbitration award? The FAA contains several sections that seem to empower a federal court to take certain specified actions related to arbitration proceedings. These include Section 4, which gives any United States district court the power to order parties to a written arbitration agreement to proceed to arbitration, Section 5, which gives the court the power to designate and appoint an arbitrator, Section 7, which gives the United States district court for the district in which an arbitrator is sitting the power to compel the attendance of witnesses whom the arbitrator has summoned, Section 9, which gives the United States court in and for the district within which an arbitration award was made the power to enter an order confirming the award, Section 10, which gives the United States court in and for the district wherein the arbitration award was made the power to make an order vacating the  award, and Section 11, which gives the United States court in and for the district wherein the arbitration award was made the power to modify or correct the award. 9 U.S.C. §§ 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11. (Here, as throughout, I have simplified the descriptions of the FAA's sections, the Appendix, infra, contains the full relevant statutory language.) This case directly concerns jurisdiction under Sections 9 and 10, but the Court's reasoning applies to all the sections just mentioned.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,62,"At first blush, one might wonder why there is any question about whether a federal court has jurisdiction to consider requests that it act pursuant to these sections. The sections' language seems explicitly to give federal courts the power to take such actions. Why does that language itself not also grant jurisdiction to act? The answer, as the Court notes, is that we have held that the FAA's authorization of a petition does not itself create jurisdiction. Ante, at 1314. Rather, the federal court must have what we have called an `independent jurisdictional basis' to resolve the matter. Ibid. (quoting Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 582, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008)).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,63,"We made clear how this works in Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556 U.S. 49, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009), a case involving Section 4. As just noted, Section 4 gives a district court the power to order parties (who have entered into a written arbitration agreement) to submit to arbitration. We held that a federal court should determine its jurisdiction by `looking through' a § 4 petition to the parties' underlying substantive controversy. Id., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262. The court asks whether it would have jurisdiction over that controversy, namely, whether that underlying substantive controversy involves a federal question or diversity (a dispute between parties from different States with a value of more than $75,000). See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332. If so, then the federal court has jurisdiction over a Section 4 petition asking the court to order the parties to resolve that controversy in arbitration.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,64,"The Vaden Court gave two reasons for adopting this look-through approach. The first, as the majority today emphasizes, was textual. See 556 U.S., at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262. Section 4 says that a party seeking arbitration may petition for an order compelling arbitration from",Breyer,0,
2021-012,65,"any United States district court which, save for the arbitration agreement, would have jurisdiction  in a civil action  of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties. (Emphasis added.)",Breyer,0,
2021-012,66,"The words save for the arbitration agreement, we reasoned, tell a court not to find jurisdiction by looking to the petition to enforce the agreement itself, but instead to the underlying controversy between the parties. See id., at 62-63, 129 S.Ct. 1262.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,67,"The second reason, which the majority today neglects, was practical. Id., at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. To find jurisdiction only where the petition to enforce an arbitration agreement itself established federal jurisdiction, we explained, would result in curious practical consequences, including unduly limiting the scope of Section 4 and hinging jurisdiction upon distinctions that were `totally artificial.' Ibid. (quoting 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law § 9.2.3.3, p. 9:21 (1995) (hereinafter MacNeil)).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,68,"Today, the majority holds that this look-through approach does not apply to Section 9 or 10 because those sections lack Section 4's save for language. Ante, at 1314. This reasoning necessarily extends to Sections 5, 7, and 11 as well, for those  sections, too, lack Sections 4's save for language. Ibid. (Without Section 4's statutory instruction, a court may look only to the application actually submitted to it in assessing its jurisdiction). Although this result may be consistent with the statute's text, it creates what Vaden feared—curious consequences and artificial distinctions. See 556 U.S., at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. It also creates what I fear will be consequences that are overly complex and impractical.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,70,"I would use the look-through approach to determine jurisdiction under each of the FAA's related provisions—Sections 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11. Doing so would avoid the same kinds of curious practical consequences that drove the Vaden Court to adopt the look-through approach in the first place. Ibid., see also Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill Harbert Constr. Co., 529 U.S. 193, 202, 120 S.Ct. 1331, 146 L.Ed.2d 171 (2000) (rejecting interpretation of the FAA that would create anomalous results). Most notably, this approach would provide a harmonious and comparatively simple jurisdiction-determining rule—advantages that the majority's jurisdictional scheme seems to lack. Cf. Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 175 L.Ed.2d 1029 (2010) (rejecting complex jurisdictional tests in favor of straightforward and simple jurisdictional rules).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,71,"Consider some of the likely consequences of the majority's reading, which applies the look-through approach only to Section 4 (where the save for language appears), but not to the FAA's other sections (where it does not appear).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,72,"First, consider Section 5. That section says that, upon application of one of the parties to an arbitration agreement, the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator. 9 U.S.C. § 5 (emphasis added). What happens when the look-through approach shows that the underlying controversy raises a federal question, but the application to appoint an arbitrator raises no federal question and does not establish diversity? A party could ask a federal judge to order arbitration under Section 4, but they could not then ask that same (or any other) federal judge to appoint an arbitrator for that very same arbitration under Section 5. That does not seem to be what Congress had in mind for these neighboring provisions—provisions that appear to assume that a judge can appoint an arbitrator in tandem with ordering parties to arbitration. Moreover, how is a federal court to determine, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, the amount at stake in a motion to appoint an arbitrator without a look-through approach? Surely not by assessing the value of the arbitrator's request for pay.",Breyer,0,

Suppose that the underlying substantive controversy does not qualify for federal jurisdiction, meaning that a federal court would not have jurisdiction to order arbitration under Section 4. If arbitration proceeds by other means, can a federal judge nonetheless compel the attendance of a witness at that arbitration, based on diversity jurisdiction, if a request to do so shows that the summoned witness lives out of State? If there are two witnesses, one in State and one out of State, can the federal judge compel the attendance of the second, but not the first? Why would Congress have wanted parties to toggle between federal and state court when seeking judicial enforcement of summons issued during a single arbitration?  And at a more basic level, who are the relevant parties to a Section 7 request when determining, for diversity purposes, whether the Section 7 dispute is between citizens of different States? The arbitrator and summoned witness? The parties in arbitration? Only the summoning party and the witness? Compare Washington National Insurance Co. v. OBEX Group LLC, 958 F.3d 126, 134 (CA2 2020) (evaluating diversity based on summoning party and witness), with Amgen, Inc. v. Kidney Center of Del. Cty. Ltd., 95 F.3d 562, 567-568 (CA7 1996) (evaluating diversity based on parties in arbitration). And assume that a federal court finds it does have jurisdiction over a Section 7 request, even though the underlying controversy involves neither a federal question nor diversity. Why would Congress have wanted federal courts to intervene to enforce a subpoena issued in an arbitration proceeding involving a controversy that itself is not important enough, from a federalism standpoint, to warrant federal-court oversight? Maine Community Health Options v. Albertsons Cos., 993 F.3d 720, 726 (CA9 2021) (Watford, J., concurring).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,74,"Moreover, diversity jurisdiction requires not only that the relevant parties be from different States but also that the amount in controversy exceed $75,000. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). How does a federal judge determine whether summoning a witness is itself worth $75,000? By examining the value of what the witness might say? By accounting for travel expenses? See Maine Community Health, 993 F.3d, at 723-724. As courts have recognized, there is very little case law to guide them in determining whether enforcement of an arbitration subpoena against a third party will enable someone to recover more than $75,000 in an arbitration dispute with a different party. Id., at 726 (Watford, J., concurring). These and other jurisdiction-related questions do not arise if a federal judge can simply follow Vaden's principle for all FAA motions: Look through the motions and determine whether there is federal jurisdiction over the underlying substantive controversy. See 556 U.S., at 62-63, 129 S.Ct. 1262.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,75,"Third, consider now Sections 9 and 10, the FAA sections directly before us, along with Section 11. Section 9 gives the United States court in and for the district within which an arbitration award was made the power to issue an order confirming the award. Section 10 gives the same court the power to vacate the award for certain specified reasons. And Section 11 gives that court the power to modify or correct the award. Where the parties' underlying dispute involves a federal question (but the parties are not diverse), the majority holds that a party can ask a federal court to order arbitration under Section 4, but it cannot ask that same court to confirm, vacate, or modify the order resulting from that arbitration under Section 9, 10, or 11. But why prohibit a federal court from considering the results of the very arbitration it has ordered and is likely familiar with? Why force the parties to obtain relief—concerning arbitration of an underlying federal-question dispute—from a state court unfamiliar with the matter?",Breyer,0,
2021-012,76,Or suppose that a party asks a federal court to vacate an arbitration award under Section 10 because the arbitrator refused to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy. § 10(a)(3). To determine at least one important aspect of diversity jurisdiction—the amount in controversy—must the court not look to the underlying dispute? The same question arises with respect to a Section 11 motion to modify an arbitral award on the ground that it is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy. § 11(c).,Breyer,0,
2021-012,77,"The majority says that these and other problems require only that the parties bring their FAA requests to state courts. Ante, at 1321-1322. But we cannot be sure that state courts have the same powers under the FAA that federal courts have. The FAA says nothing about state courts, it only explicitly mentions federal courts. See § 7 (United States district court), § 9 (the United States court), § 10 (same), § 11 (same). We have never held that the FAA provisions I have discussed apply in state courts, and at least one Member of this Court has concluded that they do not apply there. See, e.g., DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.S. 47, 59, 136 S.Ct. 463, 193 L.Ed.2d 365 (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). State courts have reached similar conclusions. See, e.g., Cable Connection, Inc. v. DIRECTV, Inc., 44 Cal.4th 1334, 1351, 82 Cal.Rptr.3d 229, 243, 190 P.3d 586, 597 (2008) (holding that §§ 4, 10, and 11 apply only in federal court), In re Beck's Superior Hybrids, Inc., 940 N.E.2d 352, 362-363 (Ind. App. 2011) (same for § 7), Henderson v. Summerville Ford-Mercury Inc., 405 S.C. 440, 450, 748 S.E.2d 221, 226 (2013) (same for § 9).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,78,"Relatedly, the majority also notes, correctly, that Section 9, 10, and 11 disputes about the enforceability of arbitral awards typically involve only state law. Ante, at 1317. It thus makes sense, the majority says, that these disputes would belong primarily in state court. See ante, at 1321-1322. But the same can be said for Section 4 disputes about the enforceability of arbitration agreements. These, too, typically involve only questions of state law. That the dispute does not implicate federal questions thus does not explain why Congress would have wanted more federal court involvement at the Section 4 stage than during the later stages.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,79,"It may be possible to eliminate some of these problems by using a federal-question lawsuit or Section 4 motion as a jurisdictional anchor. If a party to an arbitration agreement files a lawsuit in federal court but then is ordered to resolve the claims in arbitration, the federal court may stay the suit and possibly retain jurisdiction over related FAA motions. See § 3, Vaden, 556 U.S., at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. Similarly, some courts have held that if a federal court adjudicates a Section 4 motion to order arbitration, the court retains jurisdiction over any subsequent, related FAA motions. See Maine Community Health, 993 F.3d, at 725 (Watford, J., concurring), see also McCormick v. America Online, Inc., 909 F.3d 677, 684 (CA4 2018). But, as Vaden points out, to turn jurisdiction over these later motions on the presence or absence of a federal lawsuit or Section 4 motion is to turn jurisdiction on a `totally artificial distinction'—particularly when the very purpose of arbitration is to avoid litigation. 556 U.S., at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (quoting 1 MacNeil § 9.2.3.3, at 9:21).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,80,"I relate these practical difficulties in part to illustrate a more fundamental point. The majority has tried to split what is, or should be, a single jurisdictional atom—a single statute with connected parts, which parts give federal judges the power to facilitate a single arbitration proceeding from start to finish: to order arbitration, appoint an arbitrator, summon witnesses, and confirm, vacate, or modify an arbitration award. The need for simplicity, comprehension, workability, and fairness all suggest that these interrelated provisions should follow the same basic jurisdictional approach, namely, as Vaden explains, the look-through approach.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,82,"The majority's interpretation is also at odds with what this Court has said about  the purposes underlying the FAA. We have recognized that the statute reflects a clear `policy of rapid and unobstructed enforcement of arbitration agreements.' Cortez Byrd Chips, 529 U.S., at 201, 120 S.Ct. 1331 (quoting Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 23, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)), see also id., at 22, 103 S.Ct. 927 (Congress' clear intent, in the Arbitration Act, was to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,83,"We have thus interpreted the FAA to avoid unnecessarily complicating the law and breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 275, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995). Why, we asked, would Congress intend a test that risks the very kind of costs and delay through litigation  that Congress wrote the Act to help the parties avoid? Id., at 278, 115 S.Ct. 834. In other words, the FAA is a sphere in which uniformity in and of itself provides a real advantage. Ante, at 1321.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,85,"The majority's main point is straightforward: The text of the statute compels the result. As the majority rightly points out, we cannot disregard the statutory text or overcome a clear statutory directive. Ante, at 1321 (quoting Brief for Respondents 44). A statute that says it applies only to fish does not apply to turnips. The majority also rightly points out that the save for language setting forth the look-through approach appears only in Section 4, and does not appear in any of the later sections.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,86,"That fact, however, does not produce the clear statutory directive upon which the majority relies. Nothing in the text prohibits us from applying Section 4's look-through approach to the succeeding sections. The statute does not say that Section 4's jurisdictional rule applies only to Section 4, or that the same look-through approach does not apply elsewhere. Nor does any other section provide its own jurisdictional rule that would suggest Section 4's rule should not apply there.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,87,"Moreover, when we consider Section 4's text setting forth the look-through approach, we consider not only the bare meaning of the words but also their placement and purpose in the statutory scheme. Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Welch v. United States, 578 U.S. 120, 133, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016). Various aspects of the FAA's text and structure suggest that Section 4's jurisdictional rule should apply throughout. Section 5, for example, which grants the power to appoint an arbitrator, simply refers to the court. Those words, most naturally read, refer to the same court to which the immediately preceding section—Section 4—refers: a United States district court with jurisdiction as determined by the look-through approach. Requests under the FAA's various sections are also generally described in the text as applications or motions. See § 4 (application), § 5 (same), § 9 (same), § 10 (same), § 11 (same), see also § 6, § 12 (motion to vacate, modify, or correct), § 13 (application to confirm, modify, or correct). This implies that the requests are all constituent parts of one broader enforcement proceeding, not standalone disputes meriting individual jurisdictional inquiries. See, e.g., In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244, 1257 (CA11 2021) (en banc) (the term `motion' has never been commonly understood to denote a vehicle for initiating a new and freestanding lawsuit), A  Modern Dictionary of the English Language 446 (1911) (motion in court means an application to a court  to have a rule or order made which is necessary to the progress of the action).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,88,"And, more importantly, all the sections describe connected components of a single matter: a federal court's arbitration-related enforcement power. One can read these sections as a single whole, with each section providing one enforcement tool, and one section—Section 4—providing both an enforcement tool and a jurisdictional rule applicable to the entire toolbox. Read this way, the FAA provides one set of complementary mechanisms through which a federal court might facilitate a single arbitration—but only when the underlying substantive controversy is one that, jurisdictionally speaking, could be brought in a federal court had the parties not agreed to arbitrate. There is no language in any of the sections that states, or suggests, that we cannot interpret the Act in this way.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,89,"In brief, the text does not prevent us from reading the statute in a way that better reflects the statute's structure and better fulfills the statute's basic purposes. See Allied-Bruce, 513 U.S., at 279, 115 S.Ct. 834 (adopting interpretation of FAA that the statute's language permits and that is more consistent with the Act's history), Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 563, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (adopting outcome that the text of the statute permits, and sound judicial administration counsels).",Breyer,0,
2021-012,91,"The FAA's legislative history reinforces the view of the statute that I have just described. The Senate Report on the bill that became the FAA refers to the FAA's general purposes. It makes clear Congress' hope to avoid procedural complexity. It refers to parties' desire to avoid the delay and expense of litigation. S. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924). Proponents of the bill thought it would successfully serve that purpose because it would provide very simple machinery, simplify legal matters, offer speedy and plain justice, and allow no opportunity for technical procedure. Joint Hearings on S. 1005 et al. before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 16, 26, 27, 36 (1924) (hereinafter Joint Hearings). These general purposes support a simplified jurisdictional rule.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,92,"The language of the House Report suggests more. It suggests that the bill created a single jurisdictional procedure, not a set of different procedures with distinct jurisdictional rules. The Report says that the bill provides a procedure in the Federal courts for enforcement of arbitration agreements. H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924) (emphasis added). The procedure, the Report continues, is very simple,  reducing technicality, delay, and expense . Ibid. (emphasis added). That singular procedure, the Report explains, encompasses not only the initial request for a federal court to order arbitration under Section 4, but subsequent requests to vacate or modify an arbitration award under Sections 10 and 11 as well. See ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,93,"The principal drafter of the bill made the same point yet more explicitly. He testified that under the FAA, Federal courts are given jurisdiction to enforce arbitration agreements whenever  they would normally have jurisdiction of a controversy between the parties. Joint Hearings 34 (statement of Julius H. Cohen) (emphasis added). Immediately following, he said that such enforcement includes the power to appoint arbitrators under Section 5, which, of course, lacks  Section 4's save for language. Ibid. And he then proceeded to discuss the FAA's other sections, all without suggesting that their jurisdictional requirements were any different. Ibid., see also id., at 35-36.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,94,"Together, this history reinforces the interpretation of the statute that I would adopt. It suggests that Congress intended a single approach for determining jurisdiction of the FAA's interrelated enforcement mechanisms, not one approach for the mechanism provided in Section 4 and a different approach for the mechanisms provided in all other sections.* * *",Breyer,0,
2021-012,95,"In this dissent I hope to have provided an example of what it means to say that we do not interpret a statute's words in a vacuum. Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 179, 134 S.Ct. 2259, 189 L.Ed.2d 262 (2014). Rather, we should interpret those words with reference to the statutory context, structure, history and purpose, not to mention common sense. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, these considerations all favor a uniform look-through approach. And the statute's language permits that approach. Interpretation of a statute must, of course, be consistent with its text. But looking solely to the text, and with a single-minded focus on individual words in the text, will sometimes lead to an interpretation at odds with the statute as a whole. And I fear that is what has happened in this case.",Breyer,0,
2021-012,96,"I suggest that by considering not only the text, but context, structure, history, purpose, and common sense, we would read the statute here in a different way. That way would connect the statute more directly with the area of law, and of human life, that it concerns. And it would allow the statute, and the law, to work better and more simply for those whom it is meant to serve. With respect, I dissent.",Breyer,0,

That holding depended on two subsidiary conclusions. First, the Court of Appeals held that § 1806(f) procedures are to be used when an aggrieved person affirmatively challenges, in any civil case, the legality of electronic surveillance or its use in litigation, whether the challenge is under FISA itself, the Constitution, or any other law. Ibid.

Id., at 1045. That is so, the Court of Appeals reasoned, because § 1806(f)'s procedures are animated by the same concerns as the state secrets privilege and triggered by a nearly identical process.

2021-014,54,"Much of the parties' argumentation in this Court concerns the correct interpretation of § 1806(f). The Government contends that the Ninth Circuit erred because § 1806(f) is `relevant only when a litigant challenges the admissibility of the government's surveillance evidence.' Reply Brief for Petitioners 2 (quoting Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA, 14 F.4th 276, 294 (CA4 2021)). But respondents interpret that provision more broadly.",Alito,0,
2021-014,55,"Respondents do not dispute that § 1806(f) applies when the Government seeks to introduce evidence and a private party seeks to prevent such use, but they argue that § 1806(f) is also sometimes triggered when a civil litigant seeks to obtain such secret information. Brief for Respondents 34. And they say that § 1806(f) applies in this case for two reasons. First, they note that § 1806(f) is triggered not only when the Government gives notice that it intends to enter into  evidence information obtained by means of covered surveillance but also when it notifies the court that it intends to  otherwise use such information. § 1806(c). Respondents argue that the Government used information gathered under FISA when it invoked the state secrets privilege and asked the District Court to dismiss some of respondents' claims pursuant to that privilege. In respondents' view, the attempt to leverage a claim of privilege into a dismissal constitutes a use of FISA information against them. See Brief for Respondents 35-38, Tr. of Oral Arg. 71-73. Second, respondents note that § 1806(f) applies when an aggrieved person makes any motion or request to discover or obtain electronic-surveillance evidence, and they say that their complaint's request for an injunction ordering the Government to destroy or return any information gathered through the unlawful surveillance program triggered that provision. App. 146, see also Brief for Respondents 39-40.5 That prayer for relief, they maintain, constituted a request to discover or obtain the information.",Alito,0,
2021-014,56,"The Government disagrees with both of these theories. It argues that the assertion of the state secrets privilege did not constitute a use of information obtained or derived from an electronic surveillance. On the contrary, the Government contends, the assertion of the privilege represented an attempt to prevent the use of that information. Reply Brief for Petitioners 2-3. In addition, the Government maintains that respondents never filed a `motion or request  to discover or obtain' information derived from or materials relating to FISA surveillance because their complaint's prayer for relief did not constitute a `motion or request.' Id., at 5.",Alito,0,
2021-014,57,"We need not resolve this dispute about the meaning of § 1806(f) because we reverse the Ninth Circuit on an alternative ground—namely, that even as interpreted by respondents, § 1806(f) does not displace the state secrets privilege.",Alito,0,
2021-014,59,We reach this conclusion for two reasons.,Alito,0,
2021-014,61,"First, the text of FISA weighs heavily against respondents' displacement argument. FISA makes no reference to the state secrets privilege. It neither mentions the privilege by name nor uses any identifiable synonym, and its only reference to the subject of privilege reflects a desire to avoid the alteration of privilege law. See § 1806(a).6",Alito,0,
2021-014,62,"The absence of any statutory reference to the state secrets privilege is strong evidence that the availability of the privilege was not altered in any way. Regardless of whether the state secrets privilege is rooted only in the common law (as respondents argue) or also in the Constitution (as the Government argues), the privilege should not be held to have been  abrogated or limited unless Congress has at least used clear statutory language. See Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Va., 464 U.S. 30, 35, 104 S.Ct. 304, 78 L.Ed.2d 29 (1983) (presumption against repeal of the common law), Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 842, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018) (canon of constitutional avoidance).",Alito,0,
2021-014,64,"Even if respondents' interpretation of § 1806(f) is accepted, nothing about the operation of that provision is at all incompatible with the state secrets privilege. The Ninth Circuit thought that § 1806(f) and the privilege are animated by the same concerns, 965 F.3d at 1046, and respondents argue that they operate in fundamentally similar ways, Brief for Respondents 54, but that is simply wrong.",Alito,0,
2021-014,65,"As an initial matter, it seems clear that the state secrets privilege will not be invoked in the great majority of cases in which § 1806(f) is triggered. Section 1806(f) is most likely to come into play when the Government seeks to use FISA evidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding, and the Government will obviously not invoke the state secrets privilege to block disclosure of information that it wishes to use. Section 1806(f) is much more likely to be invoked in cases of this sort than in cases in which an aggrieved person takes the lead and seeks to obtain or disclose FISA information for a simple reason: individuals affected by FISA surveillance are very often unaware of the surveillance unless it is revealed by the Government. See 2 D. Kris & J. Wilson, National Security Investigations & Prosecutions § 30:4 (3d ed. 2019).",Alito,0,
2021-014,66,"With these cases out of the way, what is left are cases in which an aggrieved party, rather than the Government, triggers the application of § 1806(f), but even under respondents' interpretation of that provision, there is no clash between § 1806(f) and the state secrets privilege. The statute and the privilege (1) require courts to conduct different inquiries, (2) authorize courts to award different forms of relief, and (3) direct the parties and the courts to follow different procedures. First and most importantly, the inquiries required by § 1806(f) and our state secrets jurisprudence are fundamentally different. Under § 1806(f), the central question is the lawfulness of surveillance. Courts are instructed to determine whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted. § 1806(f) (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2021-014,67,"By contrast, when the state secrets privilege is asserted, the central question is not whether the evidence in question was lawfully obtained but whether its disclosure would harm national-security interests. As the Court explained in Reynolds, the privilege applies where there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged. 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528, see also, e.g., Zubaydah, ___ U.S., at ___, 142 S.Ct. 959, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (The state-secrets privilege permits the Government to prevent disclosure of information when that disclosure would harm national security interests), General Dynamics, 563 U.S., at 484, 131 S.Ct. 1900 (noting that the privilege exists to serve the sometimes-compelling necessity of governmental secrecy over military, intelligence, and diplomatic information). We have never suggested that an assertion of the state secrets privilege can be defeated by showing that the evidence was unlawfully obtained.",Alito,0,
2021-014,68,"Second, in accordance with the fundamentally different inquiries called for under § 1806(f) and the state secrets privilege, the available relief also differs. Under § 1806, a court has no authority to award any relief to an aggrieved person if it finds that the evidence was lawfully obtained, whereas a court considering an assertion of the state secrets privilege may order the disclosure of lawfully obtained evidence if it finds that disclosure would not affect national security (assuming that the information is otherwise subject to disclosure). And under § 1806(f), as interpreted by respondents, a court must award relief to an aggrieved person if it finds that the evidence was unlawfully obtained, but under the state secrets privilege, lawfulness is not determinative.",Alito,0,
2021-014,69,"In addition, the state secrets privilege, unlike § 1806, sometimes authorizes district courts to dismiss claims on the pleadings. We need not delineate the circumstances in which dismissal is appropriate (or determine whether dismissal was proper in this case), but even respondents concede that dismissal is available in a spy-contracting case when a case's very subject matter is secret. Brief for Respondents 25, see also Tenet, 544 U.S., at 11, 125 S.Ct. 1230, Totten, 92 U.S., at 107, General Dynamics, 563 U.S., at 492, 131 S.Ct. 1900. The availability of dismissal pursuant to the state secrets privilege in at least some circumstances shows that the privilege and § 1806(f) operate differently.",Alito,0,
2021-014,70,"Third, the inquiries under § 1806(f) and the state secrets privilege are procedurally different. Section 1806(f) allows the Attorney General to obtain in camera and ex parte review of the relevant surveillance evidence if he files an affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States. § 1806(f). By contrast, the state secrets privilege may be invoked not just by the Attorney General but by the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer. Reynolds, 345 U.S., at 8, 73 S.Ct. 528. In Reynolds, for example, the Judge Advocate General for the United States Air Force asserted the privilege. See id., at 4, 73 S.Ct. 528, see also Zubaydah, ___ U.S., at ___, 142 S.Ct. 959, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (slip op., at 5) (asserted by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency), General Dynamics, 563 U.S., at 482, 131 S.Ct. 1900 (asserted by the Acting Secretary of the Air Force).",Alito,0,
2021-014,71,"The procedures used to evaluate assertions of the state secrets privilege may also, in some circumstances, be more protective of information than the procedures prescribed by § 1806(f). Subsection (f) allows review in camera and ex parte of materials that are necessary to determine whether the surveillance was lawful. Nothing in that subsection expressly provides that the Government may shield highly classified information from review by the judge if the information is necessary to the determination of the legality of surveillance. Reynolds, on the other hand, expressly states that examination of the evidence at issue, even by the judge alone, in chambers, should not be required if the Government shows a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose information that should not be divulged in the interest of national security. 345 U.S., at 10, 73 S.Ct. 528. Thus, the state secrets privilege, unlike § 1806(f), may sometimes preclude even in camera, ex parte review of the relevant evidence.",Alito,0,
2021-014,72,"For those reasons, we conclude that Congress did not eliminate, curtail, or modify the state secrets privilege when it enacted § 1806(f).",Alito,0,
2021-014,74,"We reiterate that today's decision addresses only the narrow question whether  § 1806(f) displaces the state secrets privilege. Because we conclude that § 1806(f) does not have that effect under either party's interpretation of the statute, we do not decide which interpretation is correct. Nor do we decide whether the Government's evidence is privileged or whether the District Court was correct to dismiss respondents' claims on the pleadings. According to respondents, the state secrets privilege authorizes dismissal only where the case concerns a Government contract or where the very subject of the action is secret. See Brief for Respondents 23-34. The Government, by contrast, relies on lower court cases permitting dismissal in other circumstances. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 19, n. 2 (citing cases). The Ninth Circuit did not decide those questions, and we do not resolve them here.* * *",Alito,0,

2021-015,29,Catholic Social Services is a foster care agency in Philadelphia. The City stopped referring children to CSS upon discovering that the agency would not certify same-sex couples to be foster parents due to its religious beliefs about marriage. The City will renew its foster care contract with CSS only if the agency agrees to certify same-sex couples. The question presented is whether the actions of Philadelphia violate the First Amendment.,Roberts,0,
2021-015,31,"The Catholic Church has served the needy children of Philadelphia for over two centuries. In 1798, a priest in the City organized an association to care for orphans whose parents had died in a yellow fever epidemic. H. Folks, The Care of Destitute, Neglected, and Delinquent Children 10 (1902). During the 19th century, nuns ran asylums for orphaned and destitute  youth. T. Hacsi, Second Home: Orphan Asylums and Poor Families in America 24 (1997). When criticism of asylums mounted in the Progressive Era, see id., at 37-40, the Church established the Catholic Children's Bureau to place children in foster homes. Petitioner CSS continues that mission today.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,32,"The Philadelphia foster care system depends on cooperation between the City and private foster agencies like CSS. When children cannot remain in their homes, the City's Department of Human Services assumes custody of them. The Department enters standard annual contracts with private foster agencies to place some of those children with foster families.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,33,"The placement process begins with review of prospective foster families. Pennsylvania law gives the authority to certify foster families to state-licensed foster agencies like CSS. 55 Pa. Code 3700.61 (2020). Before certifying a family, an agency must conduct a home study during which it considers statutory criteria including the family's ability to provide care, nurturing and supervision to children, existing family relationships, and ability to work in partnership with a foster agency. 3700.64. The agency must decide whether to approve, disapprove or provisionally approve the foster family. 3700.69.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,34,"When the Department seeks to place a child with a foster family, it sends its contracted agencies a request, known as a referral. The agencies report whether any of their certified families are available, and the Department places the child with what it regards as the most suitable family. The agency continues to support the family throughout the placement.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,35,"The religious views of CSS inform its work in this system. CSS believes that marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman. App. 171. Because the agency understands the certification of prospective foster families to be an endorsement of their relationships, it will not certify unmarried couplesregardless of their sexual orientationor same-sex married couples. CSS does not object to certifying gay or lesbian individuals as single foster parents or to placing gay and lesbian children. No same-sex couple has ever sought certification from CSS. If one did, CSS would direct the couple to one of the more than 20 other agencies in the City, all of which currently certify same-sex couples. For over 50 years, CSS successfully contracted with the City to provide foster care services while holding to these beliefs.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,36,"But things changed in 2018. After receiving a complaint about a different agency, a newspaper ran a story in which a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia stated that CSS would not be able to consider prospective foster parents in same-sex marriages. The City Council called for an investigation, saying that the City had laws in place to protect its people from discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom. App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a. The Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations launched an inquiry. And the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services held a meeting with the leadership of CSS. She remarked that things have changed since 100 years ago, and it would be great if we followed the teachings of Pope Francis, the voice of the Catholic Church. App. 366. Immediately after the meeting, the Department informed CSS that it would no longer refer children to the agency. The City later explained that the refusal of CSS to certify same-sex couples violated a non-discrimination provision in its contract with the City as well as the non-discrimination requirements of the citywide Fair Practices Ordinance. The City stated that it would not enter a full foster care contract  with CSS in the future unless the agency agreed to certify same-sex couples.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,37,"CSS and three foster parents affiliated with the agency filed suit against the City, the Department, and the Commission. The Support Center for Child Advocates and Philadelphia Family Pride intervened as defendants. As relevant here, CSS alleged that the referral freeze violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. CSS sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing the Department to continue referring children to CSS without requiring the agency to certify same-sex couples.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,38,"The District Court denied preliminary relief. It concluded that the contractual non-discrimination requirement and the Fair Practices Ordinance were neutral and generally applicable under Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), and that the free exercise claim was therefore unlikely to succeed. 320 F.Supp.3d 661, 680-690 (E.D. Pa. 2018).

The court concluded that the proposed contractual terms were a neutral and generally applicable policy under Smith. 922 F.3d at 152-159.

2021-015,44,"The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. As an initial matter, it is plain that the City's actions have burdened CSS's religious exercise by putting it to the choice of curtailing its mission or approving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs. The City disagrees. In its view, certification reflects only that foster parents satisfy the statutory criteria, not that the agency endorses their relationships. But CSS believes that certification is tantamount to endorsement. And religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection. Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). Our task is to decide whether the burden the City has placed on the religious exercise of CSS is constitutionally permissible.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,45,"Smith held that laws incidentally burdening religion are ordinarily not subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause so long as they are neutral and generally applicable. 494 U.S. at 878-882, 110 S.Ct. 1595. CSS urges us to overrule Smith, and the concurrences in the judgment argue in favor of doing so, see post, pp. 1883-1884 (opinion of ALITO, J.), post, p. 1926 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.).  But we need not revisit that decision here. This case falls outside Smith because the City has burdened the religious exercise of CSS through policies that do not meet the requirement of being neutral and generally applicable. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531-532, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993).",Roberts,0,

CSS points to evidence in the record that it believes demonstrates that the City has transgressed this neutrality standard, but we find it more straightforward to resolve this case under the rubric of general applicability.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,47,"A law is not generally applicable if it invites the government to consider the particular reasons for a person's conduct by providing `a mechanism for individualized exemptions.' Smith, 494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (quoting Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 708, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986) (opinion of BURGER, C. J., joined by POWELL AND REHNQUIST, JJ.)). For example, in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), a Seventh-day Adventist was fired because she would not work on Saturdays. Unable to find a job that would allow her to keep the Sabbath as her faith required, she applied for unemployment benefits. Id., at 399-400, 83 S.Ct. 1790. The State denied her application under a law prohibiting eligibility to claimants who had failed, without good cause to accept available suitable work. Id., at 401, 83 S.Ct. 1790 (internal quotation marks omitted). We held that the denial infringed her free exercise rights and could be justified only by a compelling interest. Id., at 406, 83 S.Ct. 1790.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,48,"Smith later explained that the unemployment benefits law in Sherbert was not generally applicable because the good cause standard permitted the government to grant exemptions based on the circumstances underlying each application.

The City claimed that the ordinances were necessary in part to protect public health, which was threatened by the disposal of animal carcasses in open public places. Id., at 544, 113 S.Ct. 2217. But the ordinances did not regulate hunters' disposal of their kills or improper garbage disposal by restaurants, both of which posed a similar hazard. Id., at 544-545, 113 S.Ct. 2217.

2021-015,55,"The City and intervenor-respondents resist this conclusion on several grounds. They first argue that governments should enjoy greater leeway under the Free Exercise Clause when setting rules for contractors than when regulating the general public. The government, they observe, commands heightened powers when managing its internal operations. See NASA v. Nelson, 562 U.S. 134, 150, 131 S.Ct. 746, 178 L.Ed.2d 667 (2011), Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U.S. 591, 598-600, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008). And when individuals enter into government employment or contracts, they accept certain restrictions on their freedom as part of the deal. See Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 418-420, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 677-678, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996). Given this context, the City and intervenor-respondents contend, the government should have a freer hand when dealing with contractors like CSS.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,56,"These considerations cannot save the City here. As Philadelphia rightly acknowledges, principles of neutrality and general applicability still constrain the government in its capacity as manager. Brief for City Respondents 11-12. We have never suggested that the government may discriminate against religion when acting in its managerial role. And Smith itself drew support for the neutral and generally applicable standard from cases involving internal government affairs. See 494 U.S. at 883-885, and n. 2, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (citing Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., 485 U.S. 439, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988), Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 106 S.Ct. 2147). The City and intervenor-respondents accordingly ask only that courts apply a more deferential approach in determining whether a policy is neutral and generally applicable in the contracting context. We find no need to resolve that narrow issue in this case. No matter the level of deference we extend to the City, the inclusion of a formal system of entirely discretionary exceptions in section 3.21 renders the contractual non-discrimination requirement not generally applicable.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,57,"Perhaps all this explains why the City now contends that section 3.21 does not  apply to CSS's refusal to certify same-sex couples after all. Contrast App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a-168a with Brief for City Respondents 35-36. Instead, the City says that section 3.21 addresses only an agency's right to refuse `referrals' to place a child with a certified foster family. Brief for City Respondents 36. We think the City had it right the first time. Although the section is titled Rejection of Referral, the text sweeps more broadly, forbidding the rejection of prospective foster parents for Services, without limitation. Supp. App. to Brief for City Respondents 16. The City maintains that certification is one of the services foster agencies are hired to perform, so its attempt to backtrack on the reach of section 3.21 is unavailing. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 222 (2012) (A title or heading should never be allowed to override the plain words of a text.). Moreover, the City adopted the current version of section 3.21 shortly after declaring that it would make CSS's obligation to certify same-sex couples explicit in future contracts, App. to Pet. for Cert. 170a, confirming our understanding of the text of the provision.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,58,"The City and intervenor-respondents add that, notwithstanding the system of exceptions in section 3.21, a separate provision in the contract independently prohibits discrimination in the certification of foster parents. That provision, section 15.1, bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and it does not on its face allow for exceptions. See Supp. App. to Brief for City Respondents 31. But state law makes clear that one part of a contract cannot be so interpreted as to annul another part. Shehadi v. Northeastern Nat. Bank of Pa., 474 Pa. 232, 236, 378 A.2d 304, 306 (1977), see Commonwealth ex rel. Kane v. UPMC, 634 Pa. 97, 135, 129 A.3d 441, 464 (2015). Applying that fundamental rule here, Shehadi, 474 Pa. at 236, 378 A.2d at 306, an exception from section 3.21 also must govern the prohibition in section 15.1, lest the City's reservation of the authority to grant such an exception be a nullity. As a result, the contract as a whole contains no generally applicable non-discrimination requirement.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,59,"Finally, the City and intervenor-respondents contend that the availability of exceptions under section 3.21 is irrelevant because the Commissioner has never granted one. That misapprehends the issue. The creation of a formal mechanism for granting exceptions renders a policy not generally applicable, regardless whether any exceptions have been given, because it invites the government to decide which reasons for not complying with the policy are worthy of solicitude, Smith, 494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. 1595here, at the Commissioner's sole discretion.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,60,"The concurrence objects that no party raised these arguments in this Court. Post, at 1928-1929 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). But CSS, supported by the United States, contended that the City's made-for-CSS Section 3.21 permits discretionary `exceptions' from the requirement `not to reject a child or family' based upon `their  sexual orientation,' which alone triggers strict scrutiny.

2021-015,63,"CSS counters that foster care has never been treated as a `public accommodation' in Philadelphia. Brief for Petitioners 13. In any event, CSS adds, the ordinance cannot qualify as generally applicable because the City allows exceptions to it for secular reasons despite denying one for CSS's religious exercise. But that constitutional issue arises only if the ordinance applies to CSS in the first place. We conclude that it does not because foster care agencies do not act as public accommodations in performing certifications.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,64,"The ordinance defines a public accommodation in relevant part as any place, provider or public conveyance, whether licensed or not, which solicits or accepts the patronage or trade of the public or whose goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the public. 9-1102(1)(w). Certification is not made available to the public in the usual sense of the words. To make a service available means to make it accessible, obtainable. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 84 (11th ed. 2005), see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 812 (2d ed. 1989) (capable of being made use of, at one's disposal, within one's reach). Related state law illustrates the same point. A Pennsylvania antidiscrimination statute similarly defines a public accommodation as an accommodation that is open to, accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public. Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, 954(l) (Purdon Cum. Supp. 2009). It fleshes out that definition with examples like hotels, restaurants, drug stores, swimming pools, barbershops, and public conveyances. Ibid. The common theme is that a public accommodation must provide a benefit to the general public allowing individual members of the general public to avail themselves of that benefit if they so desire. Blizzard v. Floyd, 149 Pa. Commw. 503, 506, 613 A.2d 619, 621 (1992).",Roberts,0,
2021-015,65,"Certification as a foster parent, by contrast, is not readily accessible to the public. It involves a customized and selective assessment that bears little resemblance to staying in a hotel, eating at a restaurant, or riding a bus. The process takes three to six months. Applicants must pass background checks and a medical exam. Foster agencies are required to conduct an intensive home study during which they evaluate, among other things, applicants' mental and emotional adjustment, community ties with family, friends, and neighbors, and existing family relationships, attitudes and expectations regarding the applicant's own children and parent/child relationships. 55 Pa. Code 3700.64. Such inquiries would raise eyebrows at the local bus station. And agencies understandably approach this sensitive process from different angles. As the City itself explains to prospective foster parents, each agency has slightly different requirements, specialties, and training programs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 197a. All of this confirms that the one-size-fits-all public accommodations model is a poor match for the foster care system.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,66,"The City asks us to adhere to the District Court's contrary determination that CSS qualifies as a public accommodation under the ordinance. The concurrence adopts the City's argument, seeing no incongruity in deeming a private religious foster agency a public accommodation. See post, at 1927 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). We respectfully disagree with the view of the City and the concurrence. Although we ordinarily defer to lower court constructions of state statutes, we do not invariably do so. Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 483, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (citation omitted). Deference would be inappropriate here. The District Court did not take into account the uniquely selective nature of the certification process, which must inform the applicability of the ordinance. We agree with CSS's position, which it has maintained from the beginning of this dispute, that its foster services do not constitute a `public accommodation' under the City's Fair Practices Ordinance, and therefore it is not bound by that ordinance. App. to Pet. for Cert. 159a. We therefore have no need to assess whether the ordinance is generally applicable.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,68,"The contractual non-discrimination requirement imposes a burden on CSS's religious exercise and does not qualify as generally applicable. The concurrence protests that the Court granted certiorari to decide whether to overrule Smith, and chides the Court for seeking to sidestep the question. Post, at 1926 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). But the Court also granted review to decide whether Philadelphia's actions were permissible under our precedents. See Pet. for Cert. i. CSS has demonstrated that the City's actions are subject to the most rigorous of scrutiny under those precedents. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217.

Put another way, so long as the government can achieve its interests in a manner that does not burden religion, it must do so.",Roberts,0,

The City states these objectives at a high level of generality, but the First Amendment demands a more precise analysis. See Gonzales v. O'Centro Esprita Beneficente Unio do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 430-432, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006) (discussing the compelling interest test applied in Sherbert and Wisconsin v.

Rather than rely on broadly formulated interests, courts must scrutinize the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants. O'Centro, 546 U.S. at 431, 126 S.Ct. 1211. The question, then, is not whether the City has a compelling interest in enforcing its non-discrimination policies generally, but whether it has such an interest in denying an exception to CSS.",Roberts,0,
2021-015,71,"Once properly narrowed, the City's asserted interests are insufficient. Maximizing the number of foster families and minimizing liability are important goals, but the City fails to show that granting CSS an exception will put those goals  at risk. If anything, including CSS in the program seems likely to increase, not reduce, the number of available foster parents. As for liability, the City offers only speculation that it might be sued over CSS's certification practices. Such speculation is insufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny, see Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U.S. 786, 799-800, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011), particularly because the authority to certify foster families is delegated to agencies by the State, not the City, see 55 Pa.

Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1727. On the facts of this case, however, this interest cannot justify denying CSS an exception for its religious exercise. The creation of a system of exceptions under the contract undermines the City's contention that its non-discrimination policies can brook no departures. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546-547, 113 S.Ct. 2217.

Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), this Court held that a neutral and generally applicable law typically does not violate the Free Exercise Clauseno matter how severely that law burdens religious exercise. Petitioners, their amici, scholars, and Justices of this Court have made serious arguments that Smith ought to be overruled. While history looms large in this debate, I find the historical record more silent than supportive on the question whether the founding generation understood the First Amendment to require religious exemptions from generally applicable laws in at least some circumstances. In my view, the textual and structural arguments against Smith are more compelling. As a matter of text and structure, it is difficult to see why the Free Exercise Clauselone among the First Amendment freedoms offers nothing more than protection from discrimination.",Barrett,0,
2021-015,80,"Yet what should replace Smith? The prevailing assumption seems to be that strict scrutiny would apply whenever a  neutral and generally applicable law burdens religious exercise. But I am skeptical about swapping Smith's categorical antidiscrimination approach for an equally categorical strict scrutiny regime, particularly when this Court's resolution of conflicts between generally applicable laws and other First Amendment rightslike speech and assemblyhas been much more nuanced. There would be a number of issues to work through if Smith were overruled. To name a few: Should entities like Catholic Social Serviceswhich is an arm of the Catholic Churchbe treated differently than individuals? Cf. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171, 132 S.Ct. 694, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012). Should there be a distinction between indirect and direct burdens on religious exercise? Cf. Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 606-607, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 6 L.Ed.2d 563 (1961) (plurality opinion). What forms of scrutiny should apply? Compare Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (assessing whether government's interest is `compelling'), with Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 462, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971) (assessing whether government's interest is substantial). And if the answer is strict scrutiny, would pre-Smith cases rejecting free exercise challenges to garden-variety laws come out the same way? See Smith, 494 U.S. at 888-889, 110 S.Ct. 1595.",Barrett,0,
2021-015,81,"We need not wrestle with these questions in this case, though, because the same standard applies regardless whether Smith stays or goes. A longstanding tenet of our free exercise jurisprudenceone that both pre-dates and survives Smithis that a law burdening religious exercise must satisfy strict scrutiny if it gives government officials discretion to grant individualized exemptions. See id., at 884, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (law not generally applicable where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions (citing Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 401, n. 4, 83 S.Ct. 1790)), see also Cantwell v.

As the Court's opinion today explains, the government contract at issue provides for individualized exemptions from its nondiscrimination rule, thus triggering strict scrutiny. And all nine Justices agree that the City cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. I therefore see no reason to decide in this case whether Smith should be overruled, much less what should replace it.

Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), the Court abruptly pushed aside nearly 40 years of precedent and held that the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause tolerates any rule that categorically prohibits or commands specified conduct so long as it does not target religious practice. Even if a rule serves no important purpose and has a devastating effect on religious freedom, the Constitution, according to Smith, provides no protection. This severe holding is ripe for reexamination.",Alito,0,
2021-015,86,"There is no question that Smith's interpretation can have startling consequences.  Here are a few examples. Suppose that the Volstead Act, which implemented the Prohibition Amendment, had not contained an exception for sacramental wine. See Pub. L. 66, 3, 41 Stat. 308-309. The Act would have been consistent with Smith even though it would have prevented the celebration of a Catholic Mass anywhere in the United States.1 Or suppose that a State, following the example of several European countries, made it unlawful to slaughter an animal that had not first been rendered unconscious.2 That law would be fine under Smith even though it would outlaw kosher and halal slaughter.3 Or suppose that a jurisdiction in this country, following the recommendations of medical associations in Europe, banned the circumcision of infants.4 A San Francisco ballot initiative in 2010 proposed just that.5 A categorical ban would be allowed by Smith even though it would prohibit an ancient and important Jewish and Muslim practice.6 Or suppose that this Court or some other court enforced a rigid rule prohibiting attorneys from wearing any form of head covering in court. The rule would satisfy Smith even though it would prevent Orthodox Jewish men, Sikh men, and many Muslim women from appearing. Many other examples could be added.",Alito,0,
2021-015,87,"We may hope that legislators and others with rulemaking authority will not go as far as Smith allows, but the present case shows that the dangers posed by Smith are not hypothetical. The city of Philadelphia (City) has issued an ultimatum to an arm of the Catholic Church: Either engage in conduct that the Church views as contrary to the traditional Christian understanding of marriage or abandon a mission that dates back to the earliest days of the Churchproviding for the care of orphaned and abandoned children.",Alito,0,
2021-015,88,"Many people believe they have a religious obligation to assist such children. Jews and Christians regard this as a scriptural  command,7 and it is a mission that the Catholic Church has undertaken since ancient times. One of the first known orphanages is said to have been founded by St. Basil the Great in the fourth century,8 and for centuries, the care of orphaned and abandoned children was carried out by religious orders.9",Alito,0,
2021-015,89,"In the New World, religious groups continued to take the lead. The first known orphanage in what is now the United States was founded by an order of Catholic nuns in New Orleans around 1729.10 In the 1730s, the first two orphanages in what became the United States at the founding were established in Georgia by Lutherans and by Rev. George Whitefield, a leader in the First Great Awakening.11 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Protestants and Catholics established orphanages in major cities. One of the first orphanages in Philadelphia was founded by a Catholic priest in 1798.12 The Jewish Society for the Relief of Orphans and Children of Indigent Parents began its work in Charleston in 1801.13",Alito,0,
2021-015,90,"During the latter part of the 19th century and continuing into the 20th century, the care of children was shifted from orphanages to foster families,14 but for many years, state and local government participation in this field was quite limited. As one of Philadelphia's amici puts it, into the early twentieth century, the care of orphaned and abandoned children in the United States remained largely in the hands of private charitable and religious organizations.15 In later years, an influx of federal money16 spurred States and local governments to take a more active role, and today many governments administer what is essentially a licensing system. As is typical in other jurisdictions, no private charitable group may recruit, vet, or support foster parents in Philadelphia without the City's approval.",Alito,0,
2021-015,91,"Whether with or without government participation, Catholic foster care agencies in Philadelphia and other cities have a long record of finding homes for children whose parents are unable or unwilling to care for them. Over the years, they have helped thousands of foster children and parents, and they take special pride in finding homes for children who are hard to place, including older children and those with special needs.17  Recently, however, the City has barred Catholic Social Services (CSS) from continuing this work. Because the Catholic Church continues to believe that marriage is a bond between one man and one woman, CSS will not vet same-sex couples. As far as the record reflects, no same-sex couple has ever approached CSS, but if that were to occur, CSS would simply refer the couple to another agency that is happy to provide that serviceand there are at least 27 such agencies in Philadelphia. App. 171, App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a, see also id., at 286a. Thus, not only is there no evidence that CSS's policy has ever interfered in the slightest with the efforts of a same-sex couple to care for a foster child, there is no reason to fear that it would ever have that effect.",Alito,0,
2021-015,92,"None of that mattered to Philadelphia. When a newspaper publicized CSS's policy, the City barred CSS from continuing its foster care work. Remarkably, the City took this step even though it threatens the welfare of children awaiting placement in foster homes. There is an acute shortage of foster parents, both in Philadelphia and in the country at large.18 By ousting CSS, the City eliminated one of its major sources of foster homes. And that's not all. The City went so far as to prohibit the placement of any children in homes that CSS had previously vetted and approved. Exemplary foster parents like petitioners Sharonell Fulton and Toni Lynn Simms-Busch are blocked from providing loving homes for children they were eager to  help.19 The City apparently prefers to risk leaving children without foster parents than to allow CSS to follow its religiously dictated policy, which threatens no tangible harm.",Alito,0,
2021-015,93,"CSS broadly implies that the fundamental objective of City officials is to force the Philadelphia Archdiocese to change its position on marriage. Among other things, they point to statements by a City official deriding the Archdiocese's position as out of step with Pope Francis's teaching and 21st century moral views.20 But whether or not this is the City's real objective, there can be no doubt that Philadelphia's ultimatum restricts CSS's ability to do what it believes the Catholic faith requires.",Alito,0,
2021-015,94,"Philadelphia argues that its stance is allowed by Smith because, it claims, a City policy categorically prohibits foster care agencies from discriminating against same-sex couples.

Smith's holding about categorical rules does not apply if a rule permits individualized exemptions, 494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. 1595, and the majority seizes on the presence in the City's standard contract of language giving a City official the power to grant exemptions. Ante, at 1877. The City tells us that it has never granted such an exemption and has no intention of handing one to CSS, Brief for City Respondents 36, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a, but the majority reverses the decision below because the contract supposedly confers that never-used power. Ante, at 1879-1880, 1882.",Alito,0,
2021-015,96,"This decision might as well be written on the dissolving paper sold in magic shops. The City has been adamant about pressuring CSS to give in, and if the City wants to get around today's decision, it can simply eliminate the never-used exemption power.21 If it does that, then, voil, today's decision will vanishand the parties will be back where they started. The City will claim that it is protected by Smith, CSS will argue that Smith should be overruled, the lower courts, bound by Smith, will  reject that argument, and CSS will file a new petition in this Court challenging Smith. What is the point of going around in this circle?",Alito,0,
2021-015,97,"Not only is the Court's decision unlikely to resolve the present dispute, it provides no guidance regarding similar controversies in other jurisdictions. From 2006 to 2011, Catholic Charities in Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D. C., and Illinois ceased providing adoption or foster care services after the city or state government insisted that they serve same-sex couples. Although the precise legal grounds for these actions are not always clear, it appears that they were based on laws or regulations generally prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.22 And some jurisdictions have adopted anti-discrimination rules that expressly target adoption services.23 Today's decision will be of no help in other cases involving the exclusion of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies unless by some chance the relevant laws contain the same glitch as the Philadelphia contractual provision on which the majority's decision hangs. The decision will be even less significant in all the other important religious liberty cases that are bubbling up.",Alito,0,
2021-015,98,"We should reconsider Smith without further delay. The correct interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause is a question of great importance, and Smith's interpretation is hard to defend. It can't be squared with the ordinary meaning of the text of the Free Exercise Clause or with the prevalent understanding of the scope of the free-exercise right at the time of the First Amendment's adoption. It swept aside decades of established precedent, and it has not aged well. Its interpretation has been undermined by subsequent scholarship on the original meaning of the Free Exercise Clause. Contrary to what many initially expected, Smith has not provided a clear-cut rule that is easy to apply, and experience has disproved the Smith majority's fear that retention of the Court's prior free-exercise jurisprudence would lead to anarchy. 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S.Ct. 1595.",Alito,0,
2021-015,99,"When Smith reinterpreted the Free Exercise Clause, four JusticesBrennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and O'Connorregistered strong disagreement. Id., at 891, 892, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (O'CONNOR, J., joined in part by BRENNAN, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., concurring in judgment), id., at 907-908, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (BLACKMUN, J., joined by BRENNAN and MARSHALL, JJ., dissenting). After joining the Court, Justice Souter called for Smith to be reexamined. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 559, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). So have five sitting Justices. Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist., 586 U. S. ___, ___-___, 139 S.Ct. 634, 636-637, 203 L.Ed.2d 137 (2019) (ALITO, J., joined by THOMAS, GORSUCH, and KAVANAUGH, JJ., concurring in denial of certiorari), City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 566, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) (BREYER, J., dissenting). So have some of the country's most distinguished scholars of the Religion Clauses. See, e.g., McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism and the Smith Decision, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1109 (1990) (McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism), Laycock, The Supreme Court's Assault on Free Exercise, and the Amicus Brief That Was Never Filed, 8 J. L. & Religion 99 (1990). On two separate occasions, Congress, with virtual unanimity, expressed the view that Smith's interpretation is contrary to our society's deep-rooted commitment to religious liberty. In enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.), and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 803 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et seq.), Congress tried to restore the constitutional rule in place before Smith was handed down. Those laws, however, do not apply to most state action, and they leave huge gaps.",Alito,0,
2021-015,100,It is high time for us to take a fresh look at what the Free Exercise Clause demands.,Alito,0,
2021-015,103,"To fully appreciate what the Court did in Smith, it is necessary to recall the substantial body of precedent that it displaced. Our seminal decision on the question of religious exemptions from generally applicable laws was Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), which had been in place for nearly four decades when Smith was decided. In that earlier case, Adell Sherbert, a Seventh-day Adventist, was fired because she refused to work on Saturday, her Sabbath Day. 374 U.S. at 399, 83 S.Ct. 1790. Unable to find other employment that did not require Saturday work, she applied for unemployment compensation but was rejected because state law disqualified claimants who failed, without good cause  to accept available suitable work when offered. Id., at 399-401, 83 S.Ct. 1790, and n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). The State Supreme Court held that this denial of benefits did not violate Sherbert's free-exercise right, but this Court reversed.",Alito,0,
2021-015,104,"In an opinion authored by Justice Brennan, the Court began by surveying the Court's few prior cases involving claims for religious exemptions from generally applicable laws. Id., at 402-403, 83 S.Ct. 1790. In those decisions, the Court had not articulated a clear standard for resolving such conflicts, but as the Sherbert opinion accurately recounted, where claims for religious exemptions had been rejected, the conduct or actions in question invariably posed some substantial threat to public  safety, peace or order. Id., at 403, 83 S.Ct. 1790. (As will be shown below, this description of the earlier decisions corresponds closely with the understanding of the scope of the free-exercise right at the time of the First Amendment's adoption. See infra, at 1899-1903.)",Alito,0,
2021-015,105,"After noting these earlier decisions, the Court turned to the case at hand and concluded that the denial of benefits imposed a substantial burden on Sherbert's free exercise of religion. 374 U.S. at 404, 83 S.Ct. 1790. It forced her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Ibid. As a result, the Court reasoned, the decision below could be sustained only if it was justified by a `compelling state interest.' Id., at 403, 406, 83 S.Ct. 1790. The State argued that its law was needed to prevent the filing of fraudulent claims by unscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections, but Justice Brennan's opinion found this justification insufficient because the State failed to show that no alternative forms of regulation would combat such abuses without infringing First Amendment rights. Id., at 407, 83 S.Ct. 1790.",Alito,0,
2021-015,106,"The test distilled from Sherbertthat a law that imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest was the governing rule for the next 37 years. Applying that test, the Court sometimes vindicated free-exercise claims. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 234, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972), for example, the Court held that a state law requiring all students to remain in school until the age of 16 violated the free-exercise rights of Amish parents whose religion required that children leave school after the eighth grade. The Court acknowledged the State's admittedly strong interest in compulsory education but concluded that the State had failed to show with  particularity how that interest would be adversely affected by granting an exemption to the Amish. Id., at 236, 92 S.Ct. 1526. And in holding that the Amish were entitled to a special exemption, the Court expressly rejected the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause that was later embraced in Smith. Indeed, the Yoder Court stated this point again and again: There are areas of conduct protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and thus beyond the power of the State to control, even under regulations of general applicability, a regulation neutral on its face may, in its application, nonetheless offend the constitutional requirement for governmental neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion, insisting that Amish children abide by the compulsory attendance requirement was unconstitutional even though it applied uniformly to all citizens of the State and did not, on its face, discriminate against religions or a particular religion, and was motivated by legitimate secular concerns. Id., at 220, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2021-015,107,"Other decisions also accepted free-exercise claims under the Sherbert test. In Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 710, 720, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981), the Court concluded that a State could not withhold unemployment benefits from a Jehovah's Witness who quit his job because he refused to do work that he viewed as contributing to the production of military weapons. In so holding, the Court reiterated that `a regulation neutral on its face may, in its application, nonetheless offend the constitutional requirement for governmental neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.' Id., at 717, 101 S.Ct. 1425 (quoting Yoder, 406 U.S. at 220, 92 S.Ct. 1526).",Alito,0,
2021-015,108,"Subsequently, in Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 141, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987), the Court found that a state rule that was `neutral and uniform in its application' nevertheless violated the Free Exercise Clause under the Sherbert test. A similar violation was found in Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security, 489 U.S. 829, 109 S.Ct. 1514, 103 L.Ed.2d 914 (1989).",Alito,0,
2021-015,109,"Other cases applied Sherbert but found no violation. In United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 258, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982), the Court held that mandatory contributions to Social Security were constitutional because they were indispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security system. In Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 462, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971), denying conscientious-objector status to men whose opposition to war was limited to one particular conflict was held to be strictly justified by substantial governmental interests. In still other cases, the Court found Sherbert inapplicable either because the challenged law did not implicate the conduct of the individual seeking an exemption, see Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 700, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986), Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., 485 U.S. 439, 450-451, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988), or because the case arose in a context where the government exercised broader authority over assertions of individual rights, see O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 353, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987) (prison), Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 506, 106 S.Ct. 1310, 89 L.Ed.2d 478 (1986) (military). None of these decisions questioned the validity of Sherbert's interpretation of the free-exercise right.",Alito,0,
2021-015,111,"This is where our case law stood when Smith reached the Court. The underlying situation in Smith was very similar to that in Sherbert. Just as Adell Sherbert had been denied unemployment benefits due to conduct mandated by her religion (refraining from work on Saturday), Alfred Smith and Galen Black were denied unemployment benefits because of a religious practice (ingesting peyote as part of a worship service of the Native American Church). 494 U.S. at 874, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Applying the Sherbert test, the Oregon Supreme Court held that this denial of benefits violated Smith's and Black's free-exercise rights, and this Court granted review.24",Alito,0,
2021-015,112,"The State defended the denial of benefits under the Sherbert framework. It argued that it had a compelling interest in combating the use of dangerous drugs and that accommodating their use for religious purposes would upset its enforcement scheme. Brief for Petitioners in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, No. 88-1213, O. T. 1988, pp. 5-7, 12, 16. The State never suggested that Sherbert should be overruled. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 88-1213, at 11. Instead, the crux of its disagreement with Smith  and Black and the State Supreme Court was whether its interest in preventing drug use could be served by a more narrowly tailored rule that made an exception for religious use by members of the Native American Church.",Alito,0,
2021-015,113,"The question divided the four Justices who objected to the Smith majority's rationale. Compare 494 U.S. at 905-907, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (O'CONNOR J., concurring in judgment), with id., at 909-919, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (BLACKMUN, J., joined by BRENNAN and MARSHALL, JJ., dissenting). And the Smith majority wanted no part of that question. Instead, without briefing or argument on whether Sherbert should be cast aside, the Court adopted what it seems to have thought was a clear-cut test that would be easy to apply: A generally applicable and otherwise valid rule does not violate the Free Exercise Clause if prohibiting the exercise of religion  is not its object  but merely the incidental effect of its operation. 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Other than cases involving rules that target religious conduct, the Sherbert test was held to apply to only two narrow categories of cases: (1) those involving the award of unemployment benefits or other schemes allowing individualized exemptions and (2) so-called hybrid rights cases. See 494 U.S. at 881-884, 110 S.Ct. 1595.25",Alito,0,
2021-015,114,"To clear the way for this new regime, the majority was willing to take liberties. Paying little attention to the terms of the Free Exercise Clause, it was satisfied that its interpretation represented a permissible reading of the text, Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595, and it did not even stop to explain why that was so. The majority made no effort to ascertain the original understanding of the free-exercise right, and it limited past precedents on grounds never previously suggested. Sherbert, Thomas, and Hobbie were placed in a  special category because they concerned the award of unemployment compensation, Smith, 494 U.S. at 883, 110 S.Ct. 1595, and Yoder was distinguished on the ground that it involved both a free-exercise claim and a parental-rights claim, Smith, 494 U.S. at 881, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Not only did these distinctions lack support in prior case law, the issue in Smith itself could easily be viewed as falling into both of these special categories. After all, it involved claims for unemployment benefits, and members of the Native American Church who ingest peyote as part of a religious ceremony are surely engaging in expressive conduct that falls within the scope of the Free Speech Clause. See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989).",Alito,0,
2021-015,115,"None of these obstacles stopped the Smith majority from adopting its new rule and displacing decades of precedent. The majority feared that continued adherence to that case law would court anarchy because it would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind. 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S.Ct. 1595. The majority recognized that its new interpretation would place small religious groups at a relative disadvantage, but the majority found that preferable to the problems it envisioned if the Sherbert test had been retained. 494 U.S. at 890, 110 S.Ct. 1595.",Alito,0,
2021-015,116,"Four Justices emphatically disagreed with Smith's reinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. Justice O'Connor wrote that this new reading dramatically departed from well-settled First Amendment jurisprudence and was incompatible with our Nation's fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty. 494 U.S. at 891, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (opinion concurring in judgment). Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun protested that the majority had mischaracterized and discarded the Court's free-exercise jurisprudence on its way to perfunctorily dismissing the settled and inviolate principle that state laws burdening religious freedom may stand only if justified by a compelling interest that cannot be served by less restrictive means. Id., at 907-908, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (BLACKMUN, J., joined by BRENNAN and MARSHALL, JJ., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2021-015,117,"Smith's impact was quickly felt, and Congress was inundated with reports of the decision's consequences.26 In response, it attempted to restore the Sherbert test. In the House, then-Representative Charles Schumer introduced a bill that made a version of that test applicable to all actions taken by the Federal Government or the States. H. R. 1308, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993). This bill, which eventually became the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), passed in the House without dissent,  was approved in the Senate by a vote of 97 to 3, and was enthusiastically signed into law by President Clinton. 139 Cong. Rec. 27239-27341 (1993) (House voice vote), id., at 26416 (Senate vote), Remarks on Signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 29 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 2377 (1993). And when this Court later held in City of Boerne, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, that Congress lacked the power under the 14th Amendment to impose these rules on the States, Congress responded by enacting the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) under its spending power and its power to regulate interstate commerce. See 114 Stat. 803. Introduced in the Senate by Sen. Orrin Hatch and cosponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, RLUIPA imposed the same rules as RFRA on land use and prison regulations. S. 2869, 106th Cong., 2d Sess. (2000), 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et seq, 146 Cong. Rec. 16698 (2000). RLUIPA passed both Houses of Congress without a single negative vote and, like RFRA, was signed by President Clinton.

2021-015,118,"RFRA and RLUIPA have restored part of the protection that Smith withdrew, but they are both limited in scope and can be weakened or repealed by Congress at any time. They are no substitute for a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.",Alito,0,
2021-015,121,"That project must begin with the constitutional text. In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 338-339, 4 L.Ed. 97 (1816), Justice Story laid down the guiding principle: If the text be clear and distinct, no restriction upon its plain and obvious import ought to be admitted, unless the inference be irresistible. And even though we now have a thick body of precedent regarding the meaning of most provisions of the Constitution, our opinions continue to respect the primacy of the Constitution's text. See, e.g., Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 2316, 2323-2326, 207 L.Ed.2d 761 (2020) (starting with the text of Art. II, 1, before considering historical practice), Knick v.

2021-015,122,"Smith, however, paid shockingly little attention to the text of the Free Exercise Clause. Instead of examining what readers would have understood its words to mean when adopted, the opinion merely asked whether it was permissible to read the text to have the meaning that the majority favored. 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595. This strange treatment of the constitutional text cannot be justifiedand is especially surprising since it clashes so sharply with the way in which Smith's author, Justice Scalia, generally treated the text of the Constitution (and, indeed, with his entire theory of legal interpretation). As he put it, What I look for in the Constitution is precisely what I look for in a statute: the original meaning of the text. A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 38 (1997). See also NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 575-583, 134 S.Ct. 2550, 189 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), Stop the Beach Renourishment,  Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U.S. 702, 722, 130 S.Ct. 2592, 177 L.Ed.2d 184 (2010) (plurality opinion of SCALIA, J.), Maryland v.

2021-015,123,"Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), is a prime example of his usual approach, and it is a model of what a reexamination of the Free Exercise Clause should entail. In Heller, after observing that the Constitution was written to be understood by the voters, Justice Scalia's opinion begins by presuming that the words and phrases of the Second Amendment carry their normal and ordinary meaning. Id., at 576, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (internal quotation marks omitted). The opinion then undertakes a careful examination of all the Amendment's key terms. It does not simply ask whether its interpretation of the text is permissible. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595.",Alito,0,
2021-015,125,"Following the sound approach that the Court took in Heller, we should begin by considering the normal and ordinary meaning of the text of the Free Exercise Clause: Congress shall make no law  prohibiting the free exercise of religion. Most of these terms and phrasesCongress,27 shall make, no law,28 and religion29  do not require discussion for present purposes, and we can therefore focus on what remains: the term prohibiting and the phrase the free exercise of religion.",Alito,0,
2021-015,126,"Those words had essentially the same meaning in 1791 as they do today. To prohibit meant either to forbid or to hinder. 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (1755) (Johnson (1755)).30 The term exercise had both a broad primary definition (practice or outward performance) and a narrower secondary one (an act of divine worship whether publick or private). 1 id.31 (The Court long ago declined to give the First Amendment's reference to exercise this narrow reading. See, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-304, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).) And free, in the sense relevant here, meant unrestrained. 1 Johnson (1755).32",Alito,0,
2021-015,127,"If we put these definitions together, the ordinary meaning of prohibiting the free exercise of religion was (and still is) forbidding or hindering unrestrained religious practices or worship. That straightforward understanding is a far cry from the interpretation adopted in Smith. It certainly does not suggest a distinction between laws that are generally applicable and laws that are targeted.",Alito,0,
2021-015,128,"As interpreted in Smith, the Clause is essentially an anti-discrimination provision: It means that the Federal Government and the States cannot restrict conduct that constitutes a religious practice for some people unless it imposes the same restriction on everyone else who engages in the same conduct. Smith made no real attempt to square that equal-treatment interpretation with the ordinary meaning of the Free Exercise Clause's language, and it is hard to see how that could be done.",Alito,0,
2021-015,129,The key point for present purposes is that the text of the Free Exercise Clause gives a specific group of people (those who wish to engage in the exercise of religion) the right to do so without hindrance. The language of the Clause does not tie this right to the treatment of persons not in this group.,Alito,0,
2021-015,130,"The oddity of Smith's interpretation can be illustrated by considering what the same sort of interpretation would mean if applied to other provisions of the Bill of Rights. Take the Sixth Amendment, which gives a specified group of people (the accused in criminal cases) a particular right (the right to the Assistance of Counsel for their defence). Suppose that Congress or a state legislature adopted a law banning counsel in all litigation, civil and criminal. Would anyone doubt that this law would violate the Sixth Amendment rights of criminal defendants?",Alito,0,
2021-015,131,"Or consider the Seventh Amendment, which gives a specified group of people (parties in most civil Suits at common law) the right of trial by jury. Would there be any question that a law abolishing juries in all civil cases would violate the rights of parties in cases that fall within the Seventh Amendment's scope?",Alito,0,
2021-015,132,Other examples involving language similar to that in the Free Exercise Clause are easy to imagine. Suppose that the amount of time generally allotted to complete a state bar exam is 12 hours but that applicants with disabilities secure a consent decree allowing them an extra hour. Suppose that the State later adopts a rule requiring all applicants to complete the exam in 11 hours. Would anyone argue that this was consistent with the decree?,Alito,0,
2021-015,133,"Suppose that classic car enthusiasts secure the passage of a state constitutional amendment exempting cars of a certain age from annual safety inspections, but the legislature later enacts a law requiring such inspections for all vehicles regardless of age.

2021-015,134,It is not necessary to belabor this point further. What all these examples show is that Smith's interpretation conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the First Amendment's terms.,Alito,0,

Philadelphia's brief refers in passing to one possible argumentand the source it cites is a law review article by one of Smith's leading academic critics, Professor Michael W. McConnell. See Brief for City Respondents 49 (citing McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism 1115). Trying to see if there was any way to make Smith fit with the constitutional text, Professor McConnell came up with this argumentbut then rejected it. McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism 1115-1116.",Alito,0,
2021-015,137,"The argument goes as follows: Even if a law prohibits conduct that constitutes an essential religious practice, it cannot be said to prohibit the free exercise of religion  unless that was the lawmakers' specific object.",Alito,0,
2021-015,138,"This is a hair-splitting interpretation. It certainly does not represent the normal and ordinary meaning of the Free Exercise Clause's terms. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 576, 128 S.Ct. 2783. Consider how it would play out if applied to some of the hypothetical laws discussed at the beginning of this opinion. A law categorically banning all wine would not prohibit the celebration of a Catholic Mass? A law categorically forbidding the slaughter of a conscious animal would not prohibit kosher and halal slaughterhouses? A rule categorically banning any head covering in a courtroom would not prohibit appearances by orthodox Jewish men, Sikh men, and Muslim women who wear hijabs? It is no wonder that Smith's many defenders have almost uniformly foregone this argument.",Alito,0,
2021-015,140,"Not only is it difficult to square Smith's interpretation with the terms of the Free Exercise Clause, the absence of any language referring to equal treatment is striking. If equal treatment was the objective, why didn't Congress say that? And since it would have been simple to cast the Free Exercise Clause in equal-treatment terms, why would the state legislators who voted for ratification have read the Clause that way?",Alito,0,
2021-015,141,"It is not as if there were no models that could have been used. Other constitutional provisions contain non-discrimination language. For example, Art. I, 9, cl. 6, provides that no Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another. Under Art. IV, 2, cl. 1, the Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. Article V provides that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. Language mandating equal treatment of one sort or another also appeared in the religious liberty provisions of colonial charters and state constitutions.33 But Congress eschewed those models. The contrast between these readily available anti-discrimination models and the language that appears in the First Amendment speaks volumes.",Alito,0,
2021-015,144,"While we presume that the words of the Constitution carry their ordinary and normal meaning, we cannot disregard the possibility that some of the terms in the Free Exercise Clause had a special meaning that was well understood at the time. Heller, again, provides a helpful example. Heller did not hold that the right to keep and bear arms means that everyone has the right to keep and bear every type of weaponry in all places and at all times. Instead, it held that the Second Amendment protects a known right that was understood to  have defined dimensions. 554 U.S. at 626-628, 128 S.Ct. 2783.",Alito,0,
2021-015,145,"Following Heller's lead, we must ask whether the Free Exercise Clause protects a right that was known at the time of adoption to have defined dimensions. But in doing so, we must keep in mind that there is a presumption that the words of the Constitution are to be interpreted in accordance with their normal and ordinary sense. Id., at 576, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (internal quotation marks omitted). Anyone advocating a different reading must overcome that presumption.",Alito,0,
2021-015,148,"What was the free-exercise right understood to mean when the Bill of Rights was ratified? And in particular, was it clearly understood that the right simply required equal treatment for religious and secular conduct? When Smith was decided, scholars had not devoted much attention to the original meaning of the Free Exercise Clause, and the parties' briefs ignored this issue, as did the opinion of the Court. Since then, however, the historical record has been plumbed in detail,34 and we are now in a good position to examine how the free-exercise right was understood when the First Amendment was adopted.",Alito,0,
2021-015,149,"By that date, the right to religious liberty already had a long, rich, and complex history in this country. What appears to be the first free exercise provision was adopted in 1649. Prompted by Lord Baltimore,35 the Maryland Assembly enacted a provision protecting the right of all Christians to engage in the free exercise of religion.36 Rhode Island's 1663 Charter extended the right to all. See Charter of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1663), in Cogan 34. Early colonial charters and agreements in Carolina, Delaware,  New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania also recognized the right to free exercise,37 and by 1789, every State except Connecticut had a constitutional provision protecting religious liberty. McConnell, Origins 1455. In fact, the Free Exercise Clause had more analogs in State Constitutions than any other individual right. See Calabresi, Agudo, & Dore, State Bills of Rights in 1787 and 1791: What Individual Rights Are Really Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? 85 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1451, 1463-1464, 1472-1473 (2012). In all of those State Constitutions, freedom of religion enjoyed broad protection, and the right was universally said to be an unalienable right. McConnell, Origins 1456.38 11 2",Alito,0,
2021-015,150,"What was this right understood to protect? In seeking to discern that meaning, it is easy to get lost in the voluminous discussion of religious liberty that occurred during the long period from the first British settlements to the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Many different political figures, religious leaders, and others spoke and wrote about religious liberty and the relationship between the authority of civil governments and religious bodies. The works of a variety of thinkers were influential, and views on religious liberty were informed by religion, philosophy, historical experience, particular controversies and issues, and in no small measure by the practical task of uniting the Nation. The picture is complex.",Alito,0,
2021-015,151,"For present purposes, we can narrow our focus and concentrate on the circumstances that relate most directly to the adoption of the Free Exercise Clause. As has often been recounted, critical state ratifying conventions approved the Constitution on the understanding that it would be amended to provide express protection for certain fundamental rights,39 and the right to religious liberty was unquestionably one of those rights. As noted, it was expressly protected in 12 of the 13 State Constitutions, and these state constitutional provisions provide the best evidence of the scope of the right embodied in the First Amendment.",Alito,0,
2021-015,152,"When we look at these provisions, we see one predominant model. This model extends broad protection for religious liberty but expressly provides that the right does not protect conduct that would endanger the public peace or safety.",Alito,0,
2021-015,153,"This model had deep roots in early colonial charters. It appeared in the Rhode Island Charter of 1663,40 the Second Charter  of Carolina in 1665,41 and the New York Act Declaring Rights & Priviledges in 1691.42",Alito,0,
2021-015,154,"By the founding, more than half of the State Constitutions contained free-exercise provisions subject to a peace and safety carveout or something similar. The Georgia Constitution is a good example. It provided that all persons whatever shall have the free exercise of their religion, provided it be not repugnant to the peace and safety of the State. Ga. Const., Art. LVI (1777), in Cogan 16 (emphasis added). The founding era Constitutions of Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and South Carolina all contained broad protections for religious exercise, subject to limited peace-and-safety carveouts.43  The predominance of this model is highlighted by its use in the laws governing the Northwest Territory. In the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Continental Congress provided that no person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship, or religious sentiments, in the said territory. Art. I (emphasis added). After the ratification of the Constitution, the First Congress used similar language in the Northwest Ordinance of 1789. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, 1 Stat. 52 (reaffirming Art. I of Northwest Ordinance of 1787). Since the First Congress also framed and approved the Bill of Rights, we have often said that its apparent understanding of the scope of those rights is entitled to great respect. See, e.g., Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 575-578, 134 S.Ct. 1811, 188 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014), Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 980, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.), Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 786-792, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), Carroll v.

2021-015,156,"The model favored by Congress and the state legislaturesproviding broad protection for the free exercise of religion except where public peace or safety would be endangeredis antithetical to Smith. If, as Smith held, the free-exercise right does not require any religious exemptions from generally applicable laws, it is not easy to imagine situations in which a public-peace-or-safety carveout would be necessary. Legislatures enact generally applicable laws to protect public peace and safety. If those laws are thought to be sufficient to address a particular type of conduct when engaged in for a secular purpose, why wouldn't they also be sufficient to address the same type of conduct when carried out for a religious reason?",Alito,0,
2021-015,157,"Smith's defenders have no good answer. Their chief response is that the free-exercise provisions that included these carveouts were tantamount to the Smith rule because any conduct that is generally prohibited or generally required can be regarded as necessary to protect public peace or safety. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 539, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part) (At the time these provisos were enacted, keeping `peace' and `order' seems to have meant, precisely, obeying the laws).",Alito,0,
2021-015,158,"This argument gives public peace and safety an unnaturally broad interpretation. Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary defined peace as: 1. Respite from war . 2. Quiet from suits or disturbances . 3. Rest from any commotion. 4. Stillness from riots or tumults . 5. Reconciliation of differences . 6. A state not hostile . 7. Rest, quiet, content, freedom from terrour, heavenly rest . 2 Johnson.44  In ordinary usage, the term safety was understood to mean: 1. Freedom from danger . 2. Exemption from hurt. 3. Preservation from hurt . Ibid.45",Alito,0,
2021-015,159,"When peace and safety are understood in this way, it cannot be said that every violation of every law imperils public peace or safety. In 1791 (and today), violations of many laws do not threaten war, disturbances, commotion, riots, terrour, danger, or hurt. Blackstone catalogs numerous violations that do not threaten any such harms, including cursing,46 refusing to pay assessments for the repairs of sea banks and sea walls and the cleansing of rivers, public streams, ditches and other conduits,47 retaining a man's hired servant before his time is expired,48 an attorney's failure to show up for a trial,49 the unauthorized solemnizing of a marriage in any other place besides a church, or public chapel wherein banns have been usually published,50 transporting and seducing our artists to settle abroad,51 engaging in the conduct of a common scold,52 and exercising a trade in any town, without having previously served as an apprentice for seven years.53",Alito,0,
2021-015,160,"In contrast to these violations, Blackstone lists offences against the public peace. 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 142-153 (1769). Those include: riotous assembling of 12 persons or more, unlawful hunting, anonymous threats and demands, destruction of public floodgates, locks, or sluices on a navigable river, public fighting, riots or unlawful assemblies, tumultuous petitioning, forcible entry or detainer, riding or going armed with dangerous or unusual weapons, spreading false news to make discord between the king and nobility, or concerning any great man of the realm, spreading false and pretended prophecies to disturb the peace, provoking breaches of the peace, and libel to provoke  wrath, or expose an individual to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule. Ibid. (emphasis deleted), see also McConnell, Freedom from Persecution 835-836. These offenses might inform what constitutes actual or threatened breaches of public peace or safety in the ordinary sense of those terms.54 But the  ordinary meaning of offenses that threaten public peace or safety must be stretched beyond the breaking point to encompass all violations of any law.55",Alito,0,
2021-015,162,"That the free-exercise right included the right to certain religious exemptions is strongly supported by the practice of the Colonies and States. When there were important clashes between generally applicable laws and the religious practices of particular groups, colonial and state legislatures were willing to grant exemptions even when the generally applicable laws served critical state interests.",Alito,0,
2021-015,163,"Oath exemptions are illustrative. Oath requirements were considered indispensable to civil society because they were thought to ensure that individuals gave truthful testimony and fulfilled commitments. McConnell, Origins 1467. Quakers and members of some other religious groups refused to take oaths, ibid., and therefore a categorical oath requirement would have resulted in the complete exclusion of these Americans from important civic activities, such as testifying in court and voting, see ibid.",Alito,0,
2021-015,164,"Tellingly, that is not what happened. In the 1600s, Carolina allowed Quakers to enter a pledge rather than swearing an oath. Ibid. In 1691, New York permitted Quakers to give testimony after giving an affirmation. Ibid. Massachusetts did the same in 1743. Id., at 1467-1468. In 1734, New York also allowed Quakers to qualify to vote by making an affirmation, and in 1740, Georgia granted an exemption to Jews, allowing them to omit the phrase `on the faith of a Christian' from the State's naturalization oath. Id., at 1467. By 1789, almost all States had passed oath exemptions. Id., at 1468.",Alito,0,
2021-015,165,"Some early State Constitutions and declarations of rights formally provided oath exemptions for religious objectors. For instance, the Maryland Declaration of Rights of 1776 declared that Quakers, Mennonites, and members of some other religious groups ought to be allowed to make their solemn affirmation instead of an oath. 36, in Cogan 18. Similarly, the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 permitted Quakers holding certain government positions to decline to take the prescribed oath of office, allowing affirmations instead. Pt. II, ch. VI, Art. I, in id., at 22. The Federal Constitution likewise permits federal and state officials to make either an Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution. Art.

2021-015,166,"Military conscription provides an even more revealing example. In the Colonies  and later in the States, able-bodied men of a certain age were required to serve in the militia, see Heller, 554 U.S. at 595-596, 128 S.Ct. 2783, but Quakers, Mennonites, and members of some other religious groups objected to militia service on religious grounds, see McConnell, Origins 1468. The militia was regarded as essential to the security of the State and the preservation of freedom, see Heller, 554 U.S. at 597-598, 128 S.Ct. 2783, but colonial governments nevertheless granted religious exemptions, see McConnell, Origins 1468. Rhode Island, Maryland, North Carolina, and New Hampshire did so in the founding era. Ibid. In 1755, New York permitted a conscientious objector to obtain an exemption if he paid a fee or sent a substitute. Ibid. Massachusetts adopted a similar law two years later, and Virginia followed suit in 1776. Ibid., and n. 297.",Alito,0,

This decision is especially revealing because during that time the Continental Army was periodically in desperate need of soldiers,56 the very survival of the new Nation often seemed in danger,57 and the Members of Congress faced bleak personal prospects if the war was lost.58 Yet despite these stakes, exemptions were granted.",Alito,0,
2021-015,168,"Colonies with established churches also permitted non-members to decline to pay special taxes dedicated to the support of ministers of the established church. McConnell, Origins 1469.

Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 98, 492 (1902).

City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 541, 117 S.Ct. 2157  (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But legislatures provided those accommodations before the concept of judicial review took hold, and their actions are therefore strong evidence of the founding era's understanding of the free-exercise right.

While some protect against government actions taken for or on account of religion, they do not stop there. Instead, they go on to provide broader protection for religious liberty. See, e.g., Maryland Act Concerning Religion (1649), in Cogan 17 (guaranteeing residents not be troubled  in the free exercise of religion), New York Constitution (1777), in id., at 26 (guaranteeing the free Exercise and Enjoyment of religious Profession and Worship).",Alito,0,
2021-015,178,"Another argument advanced by Smith's defenders relies on the paucity of early cases refusing to enforce a generally applicable statute because of its failure to make accommodation, City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 542, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). If exemptions were thought to be constitutionally required, they contend, we would see many such cases.",Alito,0,
2021-015,179,"There might be something to this argument if there were a great many cases denying exemptions and few granting them, but the fact is that diligent research has found only a handful of cases going either way. Commentators have discussed the dearth of cases, and as they note, there are many possible explanations.59 Early 19th century legislation imposed only limited restrictions on private conduct, and this minimized the chances of conflict between generally applicable laws and religious practices. The principal conflicts that aroseinvolving oaths, conscription, and taxes to support an established church were largely resolved by state constitutional  provisions and laws granting exemptions. And the religious demographics of the time decreased the likelihood of conflicts. The population was overwhelmingly Christian and Protestant, the major Protestant denominations made up the great bulk of the religious adherents,60 and other than with respect to the issue of taxes to support an established church, it is hard to think of conflicts between the practices of the members of these denominations and generally applicable laws that a state legislature might have enacted.",Alito,0,
2021-015,180,"Members of minority religions are most likely to encounter such conflicts, and the largest minority group, the Quakers, who totaled about 10% of religious adherents,61 had received exemptions for the practices that conflicted with generally applicable laws. As will later be shown, see infra, at 1908-1911, the small number of religious-exemption cases that occurred during the early 19th century involved members of what were then tiny religious groups such as Catholics, Jews, and Covenanters.62 Given the size of these groups, one would not expect a large number of cases. And where cases arose, the courts' decisions may not have always been reported. Barclay, The Historical Origins of Judicial Religious Exemptions, 96 Notre Dame L. Rev. 55, 70 (2020).",Alito,0,
2021-015,182,"When the body of potentially relevant cases is examined, they provide little support for Smith's interpretation of the free-exercise right. Not only are these decisions few in number, but they reached mixed results. In addition, some are unreasoned, some provide ambiguous explanations, and many of the cases denying exemptions were based on grounds that do not support Smith.",Alito,0,
2021-015,183,"The most influential early case granting an exemption was People v. Philips, 1 W. L. J. 109, 112-113 (Gen. Sess., N. Y. 1813), where the court held that a Catholic priest could not be compelled to testify about a confession. The priest's refusal, the court reasoned, was protected by the state constitutional right to the free exercise of religion and did not fall within the exception for acts of licentiousness and practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of the State.63 This, of course, is exactly the understanding of the free-exercise right that is seen in the founding era State Constitutions.",Alito,0,
2021-015,184,"Although Philips was not officially reported, knowledge of the decision appears to have spread widely. Four years later, another New York court implicitly reaffirmed the principle Philips recognized but found the decision inapplicable because the Protestant minister who was called to testify did not feel a religious obligation to refuse.

2021-015,187,"On the other side of the ledger, the most prominent opponent of exemptions was John Bannister Gibson of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Today, Gibson is best known for his dissent in Eakin v. Raub, 12 Serg. & Rawle 330, 355-356 (1825), which challenged John Marshall's argument for judicial review in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). See McConnell, Origins 1507. Three years after Eakin, Gibson's dissent in Commonwealth v. Lesher, 17 Serg. & Rawle 155 (Pa. 1828), advanced a related argument against decisions granting religious exemptions. Gibson agreed that the state constitutional provision protecting religious liberty conferred the right to do or forbear from doing any act not prejudicial to the public weal, but he argued that judges had no authority to override legislative judgments about what the public weal required. Id., at 160-161 (emphasis deleted).",Alito,0,

Gratz, 2 Pen. & W. 412, 412-413 (Pa. 1831), where a Jewish plaintiff had taken a non-suit (agreed to a dismissal) in a civil case scheduled for trial on a Saturday. Gibson's opinion for the Court set aside the non-suit on other grounds but rejected the plaintiff's religious objection to trial on Saturday. Id., at 416-417.

L. 393, 394-397 (1823), where the court refused to exempt a member of the Covenanters religious movement from jury service. Because Covenanters opposed the Constitution on religious grounds, they refused to engage in activities, such as jury service and voting, that required an oath to support the Constitution or otherwise enlisted their participation in the Nation's scheme of government.65 It is possible to read the opinion in Willson as embodying something like the Smith ruleor as concluding that granting the exemption would have opened the floodgates and undermined public peace and safety. See 13 S. C. L. at 395 (who could distinguish  between the pious asseveration of a holy  man and that of an accomplished villain). But if Willson is read as rejecting religious exemptions, South Carolina's reconstituted high court reversed that position in Farnandis.66",Alito,0,
2021-015,190,"Other cases denying exemptions are even less helpful to Smith's defenders. Three decisions rejected challenges to Sunday closing laws by merchants who celebrated Saturday as the Sabbath, but at least two of these were based on the court's conclusion that the asserted religious belief was unfounded. See City Council of Charleston v. Benjamin, 33 S. C. L. 508, 529 (1848) (There is  no violation of the Hebrew's religion, in requiring him to cease from labor on another day than his Sabbath, if he be left free to observe the latter according to his religion (emphasis deleted)), Commonwealth v. Wolf, 3 Serg. & Rawle 48, 50, 51 (Pa. 1817) (The Jewish Talmud  asserts no such doctrine and the objection was made out of mere caprice). That reasoning is contrary to a principle that Smith reaffirmed: Repeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to determine  the plausibility of a religious claim. 494 U.S. at 887, 110 S.Ct. 1595.",Alito,0,
2021-015,191,"A third Sunday closing law decision appears to rest at least in part on a similar ground. See Specht v. Commonwealth, 8 Pa. 312 (1848). The court observed that the merchant's conscience rights might have been violated if his religion actually required him to work on Sunday, but the court concluded that the commandment to keep holy the Sabbath had never been understood to impose an imperative obligation to fill up each day of the other six with some worldly employment. Id., at 326.",Alito,0,
2021-015,192,"Other cases cited as denying exemptions were decided on nebulous grounds. In Stansbury v. Marks, 2 Dall. 213, 1 L.Ed. 353 (Pa. 1793), a decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the case report in its entirety states: In this cause (which was tried on Saturday, the 5th of April) the defendant offered Jonas Phillips, a Jew, as a witness, but he refused to be sworn, because it was his Sabbath. The Court, therefore, fined him 10, but the defendant, afterwards, waving the benefit of his testimony, he was discharged from the fine. (Emphasis deleted.)

The State argued that the defendant had voluntarily confessed, that his confession was not required by any ecclesiastical rule, and that he had confessed not to the church but to his friends and neighbours.

2021-015,194,"All told, this mixed bag of antebellum decisions does little to support Smith, and extending the search past the Civil War does not advance Smith's cause. One of the objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment,  it has been argued, was to protect the religious liberty of African-Americans in the South, where a combination of laws that did not facially target religious practice had been used to suppress religious exercise by slaves.

2021-015,197,"Here is the relevant history. The House debated a provision, originally proposed by Madison, that protected the right to bear arms but included language stating that no person, religiously scrupulous, shall be compelled to bear arms. 1 Annals of Cong. 749, 766 (1789), see also Muoz, Original Meaning 1112. Some Members spoke in favor of the proposal,67 others opposed it,68 and in the end, after adding the words in person at the end of the clause, the House adopted it.69 The Senate, however, rejected the proposal (for reasons not provided on the public record), id., at 1116, and the House acceded to the deletion.",Alito,0,
2021-015,198,"Those who claim that this episode supports Smith argue that the House would not have found it necessary to include this proviso in the Second Amendment if it had thought that the Free Exercise Clause already protected conscientious objectors from conscription, Muoz, Original Meaning 1120, but that conclusion is unfounded. Those who favored Madison's language might have thought it necessary, not because the free-exercise right never required religious exemptions but because they feared that exemption from military service would be held to fall into the free-exercise right's carveout for conduct that threatens public safety.70 And of course, it could be argued that the willingness of the House to constitutionalize this exemption despite its potential effect on national security shows the depth of the Members' commitment to the concept of religious exemptions.",Alito,0,
2021-015,199,"As for the Senate's rejection of the proviso, we have often warned against drawing inferences from Congress's failure to adopt a legislative proposal. See Schneidewind v.

The rejection of the proviso could have been due to a general objection to religious exemptions, but it could also have been based on  any of the following grounds: opposition to this particular exemption, the belief that conscientious objectors were already protected by the Free Exercise Clause, a belief that military service fell within the public safety carveout, or the view that Congress should be able to decide whether to grant or withhold such exemptions based on its assessment of what national security required at particular times.",Alito,0,

2021-015,208,"Looking for a case that had endorsed its no-exemptions view, Smith turned to Gobitis, 310 U.S. at 586, 60 S.Ct. 1010, a decision  that Justice Scalia himself later acknowledged was erroneous, Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. at 500-501, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (opinion concurring in part). William Gobitas,71 a 10-year-old fifth grader, and his 12-year-old sister Lillian refused to salute the flag during the Pledge of Allegiance because, along with other Jehovah's Witnesses, they thought the salute constituted idolatry. 310 U.S. at 591-592, 60 S.Ct. 1010.72 William's teacher tried to force his arm up, but William held on to his pocket and successfully resisted.73 The Gobitas children were expelled from school, and the family grocery was boycotted.74",Alito,0,
2021-015,209,"This Court upheld the children's expulsion because, in ringing rhetoric quoted by Smith, conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs. 310 U.S. at 594, 60 S.Ct. 1010, see also Smith, 494 U.S. at 879, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (quoting this passage). This declaration was overblown when issued in 1940. (As noted, many religious exemptions had been granted by legislative bodies, and the 1940 statute instituting the peacetime draft continued that tradition by exempting conscientious objectors. Selective Training and Service Act, 54 Stat. 885, 889.) By 1990, when Smith was handed down, the pronouncement flew in the face of nearly 40 years of Supreme Court precedent.",Alito,0,

2021-015,211,"After reviving Gobitis's anti-exemption rhetoric, Smith turned to Reynolds v.

Unlike Gobitis, Reynolds at least had not been overruled,75 but the decision was not based on anything like Smith's interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. It rested primarily on the proposition that the Free Exercise Clause protects beliefs, not conduct. 98 U.S. at 166-167. The Court had repudiated that distinction a half century before Smith was decided. See Cantwell, 310 U.S. at 303-304, 60 S.Ct. 900, Murdock v.

The Court attached diminished weight to the burden imposed by the law (because it did not require work on Saturday), id., at 606, 81 S.Ct. 1144,76 and on the other side of the balance, the Court accepted the Commonwealth's view that the public welfare was served by providing a uniform day of rest, id., at 608-609, 81 S.Ct. 1144, see Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 408-409, 83 S.Ct. 1790 (discussing Braunfeld).",Alito,0,
2021-015,214,"When Smith came to post-Sherbert cases, the picture did not improve. First, in order to place Sherbert, Hobbie, and Thomas in a special category reserved for cases involving unemployment compensation, an inventive transformation was required. None of those opinions contained a hint that they were limited in that way. And since Smith itself involved the award of unemployment compensation benefits under a scheme that allowed individualized exemptions, it is hard to see why that case did not fall into the same category.",Alito,0,
2021-015,215,"The Court tried to escape this problem by framing Alfred Smith's and Galen Black's free-exercise claims as requests for exemptions from the Oregon law criminalizing the possession of peyote, see 494 U.S. at 876, 110 S.Ct. 1595, but neither Smith nor Black was prosecuted for that offense even though the State was well aware of what they had done. The State had the discretion to decline prosecution based on the facts of particular cases, and that is presumably what it did regarding Smith and Black. Why this was not sufficient to bring the case within Smith's rule about individualized exemptions is unclear. See McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism 1124.",Alito,0,
2021-015,216,"Having pigeon-holed Sherbert, Hobbie, and Thomas as unemployment compensation decisions, Smith still faced problems. For one thing, the Court had previously applied the Sherbert test in many cases not involving unemployment compensation, including Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 109 S.Ct. 2136, 104 L.Ed.2d 766 (1989) (disallowance of tax deduction), Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 102 S.Ct. 1051 (payment of taxes), and Gillette, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828 (denial of conscientious objector status to person with religious objection to a particular war). To get these cases out of the way, Smith claimed that, because they ultimately found no free-exercise violations, they merely purported to apply the Sherbert test. 494 U.S. at 883, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2021-015,217,"This was a curious observation. In all those cases, the Court invoked the Sherbert test but found that it did not require relief.

Was the Smith Court questioning the sincerity of these earlier opinions? If not, then in what sense did those decisions merely purport to apply Sherbert?",Alito,0,
2021-015,218,"Finally, having swept all these cases from the board, Smith still faced at least one big troublesome precedent: Yoder. Yoder  not only applied the Sherbert test but held that the Free Exercise Clause required an exemption totally unrelated to unemployment benefits. 406 U.S. at 220-221, 236, 92 S.Ct. 1526. To dispose of Yoder, Smith was forced to invent yet another special category of cases, those involving hybrid-rights claims. Yoder fell into this category because it implicated both the Amish parents' free-exercise claim and a parental-rights claim stemming from Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). See Smith, 494 U.S. at 881, 110 S.Ct. 1595. And in such hybrid cases, Smith held, the Sherbert test survived. See 494 U.S. at 881-882, 110 S.Ct. 1595.",Alito,0,
2021-015,219,"It is hard to see the justification for this curious doctrine. The idea seems to be that if two independently insufficient constitutional claims join forces they may merge into a single valid hybrid claim, but surely the rule cannot be that asserting two invalid claims, no matter how weak, is always enough. So perhaps the doctrine requires the assignment of a numerical score to each claim. If a passing grade is 70 and a party advances a free-speech claim that earns a grade of 40 and a free-exercise claim that merits a grade of 31, the result would be a (barely) sufficient hybrid claim. Such a scheme is obviously unworkable and has never been recognized outside of Smith.",Alito,0,
2021-015,220,"And then there is the problem that the hybrid-rights exception would largely swallow up Smith's general rule. A great many claims for religious exemptions can easily be understood as hybrid free-exercise/free-speech claims. Take the claim in Smith itself. To members of the Native American Church, the ingestion of peyote during a religious ceremony is a sacrament. When Smith and Black participated in this sacrament, weren't they engaging in a form of expressive conduct? Their ingestion of peyote communicated, in a rather dramatic way, their faith in the tenets of the Native American Church, and the State's prohibition of that practice interfered with their ability to communicate this message in violation of the Free Speech Clause. McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism 1122. And, if a hybrid claim is one in which a litigant would actually obtain an exemption from a formally neutral, generally applicable law under another constitutional provision, then there would have been no reason for the Court in the so-called hybrid cases to have mentioned the Free Exercise Clause at all. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 566-567, 113 S.Ct. 2217 (opinion of SOUTER, J.), see also Laycock, 8 J. L. & Religion, at 106 (noting that Smith reduces the free exercise clause to a cautious redundancy, relevant only to `hybrid' cases). It is telling that this Court has never once accepted a hybrid rights claim in the more than three decades since Smith.",Alito,0,
2021-015,221,"In addition to all these maneuvers creating special categories for unemployment compensation cases, cases involving individualized exemptions, and hybrid-rights casesSmith ignored the multiple occasions when the Court had directly repudiated the very rule that Smith adopted.

2021-015,225,"The same is true about more recent decisions. In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical  Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171, 132 S.Ct. 694, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012), the Court essentially held that the First Amendment entitled a religious school to a special exemption from the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. When the school discharged a teacher, she claimed that she had been terminated because of disability. 565 U.S. at 178-179, 132 S.Ct. 694. Since the school considered her a minister and she provided religious instruction for her students, the school argued that her discharge fell within the so-called ministerial exception to generally applicable employment laws. Id., at 180, 132 S.Ct. 694. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission maintained that Smith precluded recognition of this exception because the ADA's prohibition on retaliation, like Oregon's prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral law of general applicability. Id., at 190, 132 S.Ct. 694, see id., at 189-190, 132 S.Ct. 694. We nevertheless held that the exception applied. Id., at 190, 132 S.Ct. 694.77 Similarly, in Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 2049, 2066-2067, 207 L.Ed.2d 870 (2020), we found that other religious schools were entitled to similar exemptions from both the ADA and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.",Alito,0,

In that case, we observed that when it comes to weddings, it can be assumed that a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1727. The clear import of this observation is that such a member of the clergy would be entitled to a religious exemption from a state law restricting the authority to perform a state-recognized marriage to individuals who are willing to officiate both opposite-sex and same-sex weddings.",Alito,0,
2021-015,227,"Other inconsistencies exist. Smith declared that a private right to ignore generally applicable laws would be a constitutional anomaly, 494 U.S. at 886, 110 S.Ct. 1595, but this Court has often permitted exemptions from generally applicable laws in First Amendment cases. For instance, in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 656, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000), we granted the Boy Scouts an exemption from an otherwise generally applicable state public accommodations law. In Hurley v.

2021-015,228,"The granting of an exemption from a generally applicable law is tantamount to a holding that a law is unconstitutional as applied to a particular set of facts, see  Barclay & Rienzi, Constitutional Anomalies or As-Applied Challenges? A Defense of Religious Exemptions, 59 Boston College L. Rev. 1595, 1611 (2018), and cases holding generally applicable laws unconstitutional as applied are unremarkable. The normal rule is that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course, such that a statute may  be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact. Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U.S. 320, 329, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis added). Thus, in Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459 U.S. 87, 103 S.Ct. 416, 74 L.Ed.2d 250 (1982), we held that a law requiring disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures could not be constitutionally applied to a minor party whose members and contributors would face threats, harassment or reprisals. Id., at 101-102, 103 S.Ct. 416. Cf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 466, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) (exempting the NAACP from a disclosure order entered to purportedly investigate compliance with a generally applicable statute). In Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 56, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988), and Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 459, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011), the Court held that an established and generally applicable tort claim (the intentional infliction of emotional distress) could not constitutionally be applied to the particular expression at issue. Similarly, breach-of-the-peace laws, although generally valid, have been held to violate the Free Speech Clause under certain circumstances. See Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 16, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), Cantwell, 310 U.S. at 300, 311, 60 S.Ct. 900, see also Bartnicki v.

2021-015,229,"Finally, Smith's treatment of the free-exercise right is fundamentally at odds with how we usually think about liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. As Justice Jackson famously put it, the very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 638, 63 S.Ct. 1178. Smith, by contrast, held that protection of religious liberty was better left to the political process than to courts. 494 U.S. at 890, 110 S.Ct. 1595. In Smith's view, the Nation simply could not afford the luxury of protecting the free exercise of religion from generally applicable laws. Id., at 888, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Under this interpretation, the free exercise of religion does not receive the judicial protection afforded to other, favored rights.",Alito,0,

2021-015,233,"Hybrid-rights cases. The hybrid rights exception, which was essential to distinguish Yoder, has baffled the lower courts. They are divided into at least three camps. See Combs v. Homer-Center School Dist., 540 F.3d 231, 244-247 (C.A.3 2008) (describing Circuit split). Some courts have taken the extraordinary step of openly refusing to follow this part of Smith's interpretation. The Sixth Circuit was remarkably blunt: Holding that the legal standard under the Free Exercise Clause depends on whether a free-exercise claim is coupled with other constitutional rights is completely illogical. Kissinger v. Board of Trustees of Ohio State Univ., 5 F.3d 177, 180 (1993). The Second and Third Circuits have taken a similar approach. See Leebaert v. Harrington, 332 F.3d 134, 144 (C.A.2 2003) (We  can think of no good reason for the standard of review to vary simply with the number of constitutional rights that the plaintiff asserts have been violated), Knight v.

2021-015,234,"A second camp holds that the hybrid-rights exception applies only when a free-exercise claim is joined with some other independently viable claim. See Archdiocese of Washington v. WMATA, 897 F.3d 314, 331 (C.A.D.C. 2018) (A hybrid rights claim  requires independently viable free speech and free exercise claims), Gary S. v. Manchester School Dist., 374 F.3d 15, 19 (C.A.1 2004) (adopting District Court's reasoning that the hybrid-rights exception can be invoked only if the plaintiff has joined a free exercise challenge with another independently viable constitutional claim, 241 F.Supp.2d 111, 121 (D.N.H. 2003)), Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, 68 F.3d 525, 539 (C.A.1 1995). But this approach essentially makes the free-exercise claim irrelevant. See Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277, 1296-1297 (C.A.10 2004) (It makes no sense to adopt a strict standard that essentially requires a successful companion claim because such a test would make the free exercise claim unnecessary), see also Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 567, 113 S.Ct. 2217 (opinion of SOUTER, J.)

But what that means is obscure. See, e.g., id., at 1295 (referring to helpful analogies such as the `likelihood of success on the merits' standard for preliminary injunctions or the pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act standard for obtaining an evidentiary hearing, i.e., a `colorable showing of factual innocence').78",Alito,0,

2021-015,238,"Rules that target religion. Post-Smith cases have also struggled with the task of  determining whether a purportedly neutral rule targets religious exercise or has the restriction of religious exercise as its object. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534, 113 S.Ct. 2217, Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595. A threshold question is whether targeting calls for an objective or subjective inquiry. Must targeting be assessed based solely on the terms of the relevant rule or rules? Or can evidence of the rulemakers' motivation be taken into account? If subjective motivations may be considered, does it matter whether the challenged state action is an adjudication, the promulgation of a rule, or the enactment of legislation? Should courts consider the motivations of only the officials who took the challenged action, or may they also take into account comments by superiors and others in a position of influence? And what degree of hostility to religion or a religious group is required to prove targeting?",Alito,0,
2021-015,239,"The genesis of this problem was Smith's holding that a rule is not neutral if prohibiting the exercise of religion is its object. 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Smith did not elaborate on what that meant, and later in Lukumi, which concerned city ordinances that burdened the practice of Santeria, 508 U.S. at 525-528, 113 S.Ct. 2217, Justices in the Smith majority adopted different interpretations. Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist took the position that the object of a rule must be determined by its terms and that evidence of the rulemakers' motivation should not be considered. 508 U.S. at 557-559, 113 S.Ct. 2217. This interpretation had the disadvantage of allowing skillful rulemakers to target religious exercise by devising a facially neutral rule that applies to both the targeted religious conduct and a slice of secular conduct that can be burdened without eliciting unacceptable opposition from those whose interests are affected.",Alito,0,
2021-015,240,"The alternative to this approach takes courts into the difficult business of ascertaining the subjective motivations of rulemakers. In Lukumi, Justices Kennedy and Stevens took that path and relied on numerous statements by council members showing that their object was to ban the practice of Santeria within the city's borders. Id., at 540-542, 113 S.Ct. 2217. Thus, Lukumi left the meaning of a rule's object up in the air.",Alito,0,

Holding that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated the free-exercise rights of a baker who refused for religious reasons to create a cake for a same-sex wedding, the Court pointed to disparaging statements made by commission members, and the Court noted that these comments, by an adjudicatory body deciding a particular case, were made in a very different context from the remarks by the council members in Lukumi. Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1729-1730. That is as far as this Court's decisions have gone on the question of targeting, and thus many important questions remain open.",Alito,0,
2021-015,242,"The present case highlights twospecifically, which officials' motivations are relevant and what degree of disparagement must be shown to establish unconstitutional targeting. In Masterpiece Cakeshop, the commissioners' statementscomparing the baker's actions to the Holocaust and slavery and suggesting that his beliefs were just an excuse for bigotrywent too far. Id., at ___-___, 138 S.Ct., at 1728-1730. But what about the comments of Philadelphia officials in this case? The city council labeled CSS's policy discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom. App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a. The mayor had said that the Archbishop's actions were not Christian, and  he once called on the Pope to kick some ass here. Id., at 173a, 177a-178a. In addition, the commissioner of the Department of Human Services (DHS), who serves at the mayor's pleasure,79 disparaged CSS's policy as out of date and out of touch with Pope Francis's teachings.80",Alito,0,
2021-015,243,"The Third Circuit found this evidence insufficient. Although the mayor conferred with the DHS commissioner both before and after her meeting with CSS representatives, the mayor's remarks were disregarded because there was no evidence that he played a direct role, or even a significant role, in the process. 922 F.3d at 157 (emphasis added). The city council's suggestion that CSS's religious liberty claim was a guise for discrimination was found to fall into a grey zone, and the commissioner's debate with a CSS representative about up-to-date Catholic teaching, which some might think  improper if taken out of context was best viewed as an effort to reach common ground with CSS by appealing to an authority within their shared religious tradition. Ibid. One may agree or disagree with the Third Circuit's characterization and evaluation of the statements of the City officials, but the court's analysis highlights the extremely impressionistic inquiry that Smith's targeting requirement may entail.",Alito,0,

Agudath Israel of America v. Cuomo, 980 F.3d 222, 229 (C.A.2 2020) (PARK, J., dissenting).

That case featured strong evidence that pro-life Christian pharmacists who refused to dispense emergency contraceptives were the object of a new rule requiring every pharmacy to dispense every Food and Drug Administration-approved drug. A primary drafter of the rule all but admitted that the rule was aimed at these pharmacists, and the Governor took unusual steps to secure adoption of the rule. Stormans, Inc. v.  Selecky, 854 F.Supp.2d 925, 937-943 (W.D. Wash. 2012). After a 12-day trial, the District Court found that Christian pharmacists had been targeted, id., at 966, 987, but the Ninth Circuit refused to accept that finding, Stormans, Inc., 794 F.3d 1064, 1079 (2015).

2021-015,248,"The nature and scope of exemptions. There is confusion about the meaning of Smith's holding on exemptions from generally applicable laws. Some decisions apply this special rule if multiple secular exemptions are granted. See, e.g., Horen v. Commonwealth, 23 Va.App. 735, 743-744, 479 S.E.2d 553, 557 (1997), Rader v. Johnston, 924 F.Supp. 1540, 1551-1553 (D.Neb. 1996). Others conclude that even one secular exemption is enough. See, e.g., Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1234-1235 (C.A.11 2004), Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 365 (C.A.3 1999).

2021-015,250,"Identifying appropriate comparators. To determine whether a law provides equal treatment for secular and religious conduct, two steps are required. First, a court must identify the secular conduct with which the religious conduct is to be compared. Second, the court must determine whether the State's reasons for regulating the religious conduct apply with equal force to the secular conduct with which it is compared. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 543, 113 S.Ct. 2217. In Smith, this inquiry undoubtedly seemed straightforward: The secular conduct and the religious conduct prohibited by the Oregon criminal statute were identical. But things are not always that simple.",Alito,0,
2021-015,251,"Cases involving rules designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 have driven that point home. State and local rules adopted for this purpose have typically imposed different restrictions for different categories of activities. Sometimes religious services have been placed in a category with certain secular activities, and sometimes religious services have been given a separate category of their own. To determine whether COVID-19 rules provided neutral treatment for religious and secular conduct, it has been necessary to compare the restrictions on religious services with the restrictions on secular activities that present a comparable risk of spreading the virus, and identifying the secular activities  that should be used for comparison has been hotly contested.",Alito,0,

The Smith majority thought that adherence to Sherbert would invite anarchy, 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S.Ct. 1595, but experience has shown that this fear was not well founded. Both RFRA and RLUIPA impose essentially the same requirements as Sherbert, and we have observed that the courts are well up to the task of applying that test. Gonzales v.

2021-015,259,"Another significant development is the subsequent profusion of studies on the original meaning of the Free Exercise Clause.

It claims that some individuals, relying on Smith, have moved to jurisdictions with anti-discrimination laws that do not permit religious exemptions.

The bar association does not cite any actual examples of individuals who fall into this category, and there is reason to doubt that many actually exist.",Alito,0,
2021-015,266,"For the hypothesized course of conduct to make sense, all of the following conditions would have to be met. First, it would be necessary for the individuals in question to believe that a religiously motivated party in the jurisdiction they left or avoided might engage in conduct that harmed them. Second, this conduct would have to be conduct not already protected by Smith in that it (a) did not violate a generally applicable state law, (b) that law did not allow individual exemptions, and (c) there was insufficient proof of religious targeting. Third, the feared conduct would have to fall outside the scope of RLUIPA. Fourth, the conduct, although not protected by Smith, would have to be otherwise permitted by local law, for example, through a state version of RFRA. Fifth, this fear of harm at the hands of a religiously motivated actor would have to be a but-for cause of the decision to move. Perhaps there are individuals who fall into the category that the bar association hypothesizes, but we should not allow violations of the Free Exercise Clause in perpetuity based on such speculation.",Alito,0,

2021-015,273,"Whether this test should be rephrased or supplemented with specific rules is a question that need not be resolved here because Philadelphia's ouster of CSS from foster care work simply does not further any interest that can properly be protected in this case.

Declaring that Jesus was the Son of God is offensive to Judaism and Islam, and stating that Jesus was not the Son of God is insulting to Christian belief.

The members of CSS's staff are not City employees, the power asserted by the City goes far beyond a refusal to enter into a contract, and the function that CSS and other private foster care agencies have been performing for decades has not historically been an exclusively governmental function. See, e.g., Leshko v. Servis, 423 F.3d 337, 343-344 (C.A.3 2005) (No aspect of providing care to foster children in Pennsylvania has ever been the exclusive province of the government), Rayburn v.

As Justice ALITO's opinion demonstrates, Smith failed to respect this Court's precedents, was mistaken as a matter of the Constitution's original public meaning, and has proven unworkable in practice. A majority of our colleagues, however, seek to sidestep the question. They agree that the City of Philadelphia's treatment of Catholic Social Services (CSS) violates the Free Exercise Clause. But, they say, there's no need or reason to address the error of Smith today. Ante, at 1876-1877 (majority opinion), ante, at 1883 (BARRETT, J., concurring).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,287,"On the surface it may seem a nice move, but dig an inch deep and problems emerge. Smith exempts neutral and generally applicable laws from First Amendment scrutiny. 494 U.S. at 878-881, 110 S.Ct. 1595. The City argues that its challenged rules qualify for that exemption because they require all foster-care agencies religious and non-religious aliketo recruit and certify same-sex couples interested in serving as foster parents. For its part, the majority assumes (without deciding) that Philadelphia's rule is indeed neutral toward religion. Ante, at 1876-1877. So to avoid Smith's exemption and subject the City's policy to First Amendment scrutiny, the majority must carry the burden of showing that the policy isn't generally applicable.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,289,"That path turns out to be a long and lonely one. The district court held that the City's public accommodations law (its Fair Practices Ordinance or FPO) is both generally applicable and applicable to CSS. At least initially, the majority chooses to bypass the district court's major premise that the FPO qualifies as generally applicable under Smith. It's a curious choice given that the FPO applies only to certain defined entities that qualify as public accommodations while the generally applicable law in Smith was an across-the-board criminal prohibition enforceable against anyone. 494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. 1595. But if the goal is to turn a big  dispute of constitutional law into a small one, the majority's choice to focus its attack on the district court's minor premise that the FPO applies to CSS as a matter of municipal lawbegins to make some sense. Still, it isn't exactly an obvious path. The Third Circuit did not address the district court's interpretation of the FPO. And not one of the over 80 briefs before us contests it. To get to where it wishes to go, then, the majority must go it alone. So much for the adversarial process and being a court of review, not of first view. Brownback v. King, 592 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4, 141 S.Ct. 740, 747, n. 4, 209 L.Ed.2d 33 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,290,"Trailblazing through the Philadelphia city code turns out to be no walk in the park either. As the district court observed, the City's FPO defines public accommodations expansively to include any provider that solicits or accepts patronage of the public or whose  services or facilities are made available to the public. App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a (alteration omitted, emphasis deleted). And, the district court held, this definition covers CSS because (among other things) it publicly solicits prospective foster parents and provides professional `services' to the public. Id., at 78a. All of which would seem to block the majority's way. So how does it get around that problem?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,291,"It changes the conversation. The majority ignores the FPO's expansive definition of public accommodations. It ignores the reason the district court offered for why CSS falls within that definition. Instead, it asks us to look to a different public accommodations lawa Commonwealth of Pennsylvania public accommodations statute. See ante, at 1879-1880 (discussing Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 43, 954(l) (Purdon Cum. Supp. 2009)). And, the majority promises, CSS fails to qualify as a public accommodation under the terms of that law. But why should we ignore the City's law and look to the Commonwealth's? No one knows because the majority doesn't say.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,292,"Even playing along with this statutory shell game doesn't solve the problem. The majority highlights the fact that the state law lists various examples of public accommodations including hotels, restaurants, and swimming pools. Ante, at 1880. The majority then argues that foster agencies fail to qualify as public accommodations because, unlike these listed entities, foster agencies involve a customized and selective assessment. Ibid. But where does that distinction come from? Not the text of the state statute, not state case law, and certainly not from the briefs. The majority just declares ita new rule of Pennsylvania common law handed down by the United States Supreme Court.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,293,"The majority's gloss on state law isn't just novel, it's probably wrong. While the statute lists hotels, restaurants, and swimming pools as examples of public accommodations, it also lists over 40 other kinds of institutionsand the statute emphasizes that these examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. See 954(l). Among its illustrations, too, the statute offers public colleges and universities as examples of public accommodations. Ibid. Often these institutions do engage in a customized and selective assessment of their clients (students) and employees (faculty). And if they can qualify as public accommodations under the state statute, it isn't exactly clear why foster agencies cannot. What does the majority have to say about this problem? Again, silence.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,294,"If anything, the majority's next move only adds to the confusion. It denies cooking up any of these arguments on its own. It says it merely means to agree with CSS's position  that its `foster services do not constitute a public accommodation  under the City's Fair Practices Ordinance.' Ante, at 1881 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 159a). But CSS's cited positionwhich comes from a letter it sent to the City before litigation even beganincludes nothing like the majority's convoluted chain of reasoning involving a separate state statute. Id., at 159a-160a. Instead, CSS's letter contends that the organization's services do not qualify as public accommodations because they are only available to at-risk children who have been removed by the state and are in need of a loving home. Ibid. The majority tells us with assurance that it agrees with this position, adding that it would be incongruous to deem a private religious foster agency a public accommodation. Ante, at 1881.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,295,"What to make of all this? Maybe this part of the majority opinion should be read only as reaching for somethinganything to support its curious separate-statute move. But maybe the majority means to reject the district court's major premise after allsuggesting it would be incongruous for public accommodations laws to qualify as generally applicable under Smith because they do not apply to everyone. Or maybe the majority means to invoke a canon of constitutional avoidance: Before concluding that a public accommodations law is generally applicable under Smith, courts must ask themselves whether it would be incongruous to apply that law to religious groups. Maybe all this ambiguity is deliberate, maybe not. The only thing certain here is that the majority's attempt to cloak itself in CSS's argument introduces more questions than answers.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,297,"Still that's not the end of it. Even now, the majority's circumnavigation of Smith remains only half complete. The City argues that, in addition to the FPO, another generally applicable nondiscrimination rule can be found in 15.1 of its contract with CSS. That provision independently instructs that foster service providers shall not discriminate or permit discrimination against any individual on the basis of  sexual orientation. Supp. App. to Brief for City Respondents 31. This provision, the City contends, amounts to a second and separate rule of general applicability exempt from First Amendment scrutiny under Smith. Once more, the majority must find some way around the problem. Its attempt to do so proceeds in three steps.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,298,"First, the majority directs our attention to another provision of the contract 3.21. See ante, at 1877-1879. Entitled Rejection of Referral, this provision prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, race, religion, or other grounds unless an exception is granted in the government's sole discretion. Supp. App. to Brief for City Respondents 16-17. Clearly, the majority says, that provision doesn't state a generally applicable rule against discrimination because it expressly contemplates exceptions. Ante, at 1878.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,299,"But how does that help? As 3.21's title indicates, the provision contemplates exceptions only when it comes to the referral stage of the foster processwhere the government seeks to place a particular child with an available foster family. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 221 (2012) (The title and headings are permissible indicators of meaning (boldface deleted)). So, for example, the City has taken race into account when placing a child who used racial slurs to avoid placing him with parents of that race. Tr. of Oral Arg. 61. Meanwhile, our case has nothing to do with the referralor placement stage of the foster process. This case concerns the recruitment and certification stageswhere foster agencies like CSS  screen and enroll adults who wish to serve as foster parents. And in those stages of the foster process, 15.1 seems to prohibit discrimination absolutely.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,300,"That difficulty leads the majority to its second step. It asks us to ignore 3.21's title and its limited application to the referral stage. See ante, at 1879. Instead, the majority suggests, we should reconceive 3.21 as authorizing exceptions to the City's nondiscrimination rule at every stage of the foster process. Once we do that, the majority stresses, 3.21's reservation of discretion is irreconcilable with 15.1's blanket prohibition against discrimination. See ante, at 1879.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,301,"This sets up the majority's final move where the real magic happens. Having conjured a conflict within the contract, the majority devises its own solution. It points to some state court decisions that, it says, set forth the rule that Pennsylvania courts shouldn't interpret one provision in a contract to annul another part. Ibid. To avoid nullifying 3.21's reservation of discretion, the majority insists, it has no choice but to rewrite 15.1. All so that voilaѤ 15.1 now contains its own parallel reservation of discretion. See ante, at 1879. As rewritten, the contract contains no generally applicable rule against discrimination anywhere in the foster process.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,302,"From start to finish, it is a dizzying series of maneuvers. The majority changes the terms of the parties' contract, adopting an uncharitably broad reading (really revision) of 3.21. It asks us to ignore the usual rule that a more specific contractual provision can comfortably coexist with a more general one. And it proceeds to resolve a conflict it created by rewriting 15.1. Once more, too, no party, amicus, or lower court argued for any of this.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,303,"To be sure, the majority again claims otherwiserepresenting that it merely adopts the arguments of CSS and the United States. See ante, at 1879. But here, too, the majority's representation raises rather than resolves questions. Instead of pursuing anything like the majority's contract arguments, CSS and the United States suggest that 3.21 alone triggers strict scrutiny, Reply Brief 5 (emphasis added), because that provision authorizes the City to grant formal exemptions from its policy of nondiscrimination, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26 (emphasis added). On this theory, it's irrelevant whether 3.21 or 15.1 reserve discretion to grant exemptions at all stages of the process or at only one stage. Instead, the City's power to grant exemptions from its nondiscrimination policy anywhere undercuts its asserted interests and thus triggers strict scrutiny for applying the policy everywhere. Id., at 21. Exceptions for one means strict scrutiny for all. See, e.g., Tandon v. Newsom, ante, at 1874-1875 (per curiam). All of which leaves us to wonder: Is the majority just stretching to claim some cover for its novel arguments? Or does it actually mean to adopt the theory it professes to adopt?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,305,"Given all the maneuvering, it's hard not to wonder if the majority is so anxious to say nothing about Smith's fate that it is willing to say pretty much anything about municipal law and the parties' briefs. One way or another, the majority seems determined to declare there is no need or reason to revisit Smith today. Ante, at 1876-1877 (majority opinion), ante, at 1883 (BARRETT, J., concurring).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,306,"But tell that to CSS. Its litigation has already lasted yearsand today's (ir)resolution promises more of the same. Had we followed the path Justice ALITO out-lines holding that the City's rules cannot avoid strict scrutiny even if they qualify as neutral and generally applicablethis case  would end today. Instead, the majority's course guarantees that this litigation is only getting started. As the final arbiter of state law, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court can effectively overrule the majority's reading of the Commonwealth's public accommodations law. The City can revise its FPO to make even plainer still that its law does encompass foster services. Or with a flick of a pen, municipal lawyers may rewrite the City's contract to close the 3.21 loophole.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,307,"Once any of that happens, CSS will find itself back where it started. The City has made clear that it will never tolerate CSS carrying out its foster-care mission in accordance with its sincerely held religious beliefs. To the City, it makes no difference that CSS has not denied service to a single same-sex couple, that dozens of other foster agencies stand willing to serve same-sex couples, or that CSS is committed to help any inquiring same-sex couples find those other agencies. The City has expressed its determination to put CSS to a choice: Give up your sincerely held religious beliefs or give up serving foster children and families. If CSS is unwilling to provide foster-care services to same-sex couples, the City prefers that CSS provide no foster-care services at all. This litigation thus promises to slog on for years to come, consuming time and resources in court that could be better spent serving children. And throughout it all, the opacity of the majority's professed endorsement of CSS's arguments ensures the parties will be forced to devote resources to the unenviable task of debating what it even means.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,308,"Nor will CSS bear the costs of the Court's indecision alone. Individuals and groups across the country will pay the pricein dollars, in time, and in continued uncertainty about their religious liberties.

Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n, 584 U. S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 1719, 201 L.Ed.2d 35 (2018). After being forced to litigate all the way to the Supreme Court, we ruled for him on narrow grounds similar to those the majority invokes today. Because certain government officials responsible for deciding Mr. Phillips's compliance with a local public accommodations law uttered statements exhibiting hostility to his religion, the Court held, those officials failed to act neutrally under Smith. See 584 U. S., at ___-___, 138 S.Ct., at 1730-1732. But with Smith still on the books, all that victory assured Mr. Phillips was a new round of litigationwith officials now presumably more careful about admitting their motives.

A nine-year odyssey thus barrels on. No doubt, too, those who cannot afford such endless litigation under Smith's regime have been and will continue to be forced to forfeit religious freedom that the Constitution protects.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,309,"The costs of today's indecision fall on lower courts too. As recent cases involving COVID-19 regulations highlight, judges across the country continue to struggle to understand and apply Smith's test even thirty years after it was announced. In the last nine months alone, this Court has had to intervene at least half a dozen times to clarify how Smith works. See, e.g., Tandon, ante, at p. 1874, Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 63, 208 L.Ed.2d 206 (2020) (per curiam), High Plains Harvest Church v. Polis, 592 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 527, 208 L.Ed.2d 503 (2020). To be sure, this Court began to resolve at least some of the confusion surrounding Smith's application  in Tandon. But Tandon treated the symptoms, not the underlying ailment. We owe it to the parties, to religious believers, and to our colleagues on the lower courts to cure the problem this Court created.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,310,"It's not as if we don't know the right answer. Smith has been criticized since the day it was decided. No fewer than ten Justicesincluding six sitting Justices have questioned its fidelity to the Constitution. See ante, at 1887-1889 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment), ante, at 1882-1883 (BARRETT, J., concurring). The Court granted certiorari in this case to resolve its fate. The parties and amici responded with over 80 thoughtful briefs addressing every angle of the problem. Justice ALITO has offered a comprehensive opinion explaining why Smith should be overruled. And not a single Justice has lifted a pen to defend the decision. So what are we waiting for?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-015,311,"We hardly need to wrestle today with every conceivable question that might follow from recognizing Smith was wrong. See ante, at 1883 (BARRETT, J., concurring).

But that's no excuse for refusing to apply the original public meaning in the dispute actually before us. Rather than adhere to Smith until we settle on some grand unified theory of the Free Exercise Clause for all future cases until the end of time, see American Legion v. American Humanist Assn., 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2067, 2086-2087, 204 L.Ed.2d 452 (2019) (plurality opinion), the Court should overrule it now, set us back on the correct course, and address each case as it comes.",Gorsuch,0,

The particular appeal before us arises at the intersection of public accommodations laws and the First Amendment, it involves same-sex couples and the Catholic Church. Perhaps our colleagues believe today's circuitous path will at least steer the Court around the controversial subject matter and avoid picking a side. But refusing to give CSS the benefit of what we know to be the correct interpretation of the Constitution is picking a side. Smith committed a constitutional error. Only we can fix it.

After moving to Puerto Rico, Vaello Madero no longer was eligible for Supplemental Security Income benefits. Yet for several years, the U. S.

For one, Congress would presumably need to extend not just Supplemental Security Income but also many other federal benefits programs to residents of the Territories in the same way that those programs cover residents of the States. And if this Court were to require identical treatment on the benefits side, residents of the States could presumably insist that federal taxes be imposed on residents of Puerto Rico and other Territories in the same way that those taxes are imposed on residents of the States. Doing that, however, would inflict significant new financial burdens on residents of Puerto Rico, with serious implications for the Puerto Rican people and the Puerto Rican economy. The Constitution does not require that extreme outcome.1  * * *",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-016,39,"The Constitution affords Congress substantial discretion over how to structure federal tax and benefits programs for residents of the Territories. Exercising that discretion, Congress may extend Supplemental Security Income benefits to residents of Puerto Rico. Indeed, the Solicitor General has informed the Court that the President supports such legislation as a matter of policy. But the limited question before this Court is whether, under the Constitution, Congress must extend Supplemental Security Income to residents of Puerto Rico to the same extent as to residents of the States. The answer is no. We therefore reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.",Kavanaugh,0,

2021-016,42,"I join the opinion of the Court. I write separately to address the premise that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment contains an equal protection component whose substance is precisely the same as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638, n. 2, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975). Although I have joined the Court in applying this doctrine, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 213-217, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995), I now doubt whether it comports with the original meaning of the Constitution. Firmer ground for prohibiting the Federal Government from discriminating on the basis of race, at least with respect to civil rights, may well be found in the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,44,"Until the middle of the 20th century, this Court consistently recognized that the Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause and it provides no guaranty against discriminatory legislation by Congress. Detroit Bank v. United States, 317 U.S. 329, 337, 63 S.Ct. 297, 87 L.Ed. 304 (1943), see also La Belle Iron Works v. United States, 256 U.S. 377, 392, 41 S.Ct. 528, 65 L.Ed. 998 (1921). However, the Court did maintain that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause prohibited such discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial of due process, i.e., legislation that would fail rational-basis review. Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100, 102, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943).",Thomas,0,
2021-016,45,"In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954), the Court began in earnest to fold an equal protection guarantee into the concept of due process. Decided the same day as Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), Bolling confronted the constitutionality of government-imposed segregation in the District of Columbia's public schools. Because any such segregation was attributable to Congress, see U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, rather than state action, the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. Bolling instead read an equal protection principle into the Fifth Amendment's requirement that no person shall  be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. See 347 U.S. at 498-500, 74 S.Ct. 693.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,46,"Bolling's locating of an equal protection guarantee in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause raises substantial questions. First, Bolling's interpretation seemingly relies upon the Lochner-era theory  that unreasonable discrimination is a denial of due process of law. 347 U.S. at 499, 74 S.Ct. 693 (citing Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149 (1917)), see also 347 U.S. at 500, 74 S.Ct. 693 (Segregation in public education is not reasonably related to any proper governmental objective and therefore constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of  liberty), see Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905). By invoking due process to hold an allegedly unreasonable or arbitrary legislative classification unconstitutional, Bolling made clear that it was applying this Court's substantive due process doctrine. See N. Chapman & M. McConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1800 (2012) (When the Court purports to evaluate whether a state's interest is `legitimate' or a `justified' interference with a judge-made liberty, the result is no different in principle than in other modern substantive due process cases).",Thomas,0,
2021-016,47,"But the notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only `process' before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 811, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Rather, `considerable historical evidence supports the position that due process of law was a separation-of-powers concept designed as a safeguard against unlicensed executive action, forbidding only deprivations not authorized by legislation or common law.' Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 623, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred Years 1789-1888, p. 272 (1985)), see also In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 378-382, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (BLACK, J., dissenting). And, to the extent that the Due Process Clause restrains the authority of Congress, it may, at most, prohibit Congress from authorizing the deprivation of a person's life, liberty, or property without providing him the customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 28, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1856). Either way, the Fifth Amendment's text and history provide little support for modern substantive due process doctrine.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,48,"To be sure, some have argued that antebellum due process theory commonly included an equality principle that circumscribed legislative authority. K. Lash, Enforcing the Rights of Due Process, 106 Geo. L. J. 1389, 1443 (2018). But there is no historical consensus that this kind of substantive due process took hold in antebellum America. See, e.g., I. Wurman, The Second Founding 28-35 (2020). And, in any event, the pre-constitutional and Founding-era evidence regarding the meaning of `due process of law' strongly suggests the phrase most likely would have been viewed in 1791  as guaranteeing either that duly enacted law would be followed or that certain requisite procedures would be observed. R. Williams, The One and Only Substantive Due Process Clause, 120 Yale L. J. 408, 416 (2010). It is not clear why post-1791 developments should displace more probative preconstitutional and founding-era evidence. See, e.g., S. Calabresi & S. Prakash, The President's Power To Execute the Laws, 104 Yale L. J. 541, 550-551 (1994) (The Constitution's postenactment  `legislative' history is the history that is least likely to reflect the original understanding).",Thomas,0,
2021-016,49,"Second, Bolling reasoned that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause covers the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, 347 U.S. at 499-500, 74 S.Ct. 693, and therefore guaranteed freedom from segregated schooling. That understanding of liberty likely sweeps too broadly. Given the relevant history, it is hard to see how the `liberty' protected by the Due Process Clause could be interpreted to include anything broader than freedom from physical restraint. Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 725, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). And even if liberty encompasses more than that, in the American legal tradition, liberty has long been understood as individual freedom from governmental action, not as a right to a particular government entitlement. Id., at 726, 135 S.Ct. 2584, see also C. Green, Seven Problems With Antidiscrimination Due Process, 11 Faulkner L. Rev. 1, 32 (2019) (Even on a very expansive view, `liberty' is still only freedom from interference, rather than positive rights to receive benefits or participate in others' activities). Consequently, if liberty in the Due Process Clause does not include any rights to public benefits, it is unclear how that provision can constrain the regulation of access to those benefits.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,50,"Third, although the Bolling Court claimed that its decision did not imply that due process and equal protection are always interchangeable phrases, 347 U.S. at 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, its logic led this Court to later erase any distinction between them. We now maintain that the equal protection obligations imposed by the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments are indistinguishable. Adarand Constructors, Inc., 515 U.S. at 217, 115 S.Ct. 2097, see also Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1, 137 S.Ct. 1678, 1686, n. 1, 98 L.Ed.2d 150 (2017). But if due process of law fully subsumed the guarantee of equal protection, it is unclear why § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment would redundantly state both requirements in consecutive Clauses. See, e.g., G. Maggs, Innovation in Constitutional Law, 86 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1038, 1053 (1992) (Maggs), R. Natelson, The Constitution and the Public Trust, 52 Buffalo L. Rev. 1077, 1174, n. 432 (2004), R. Primus, Bolling Alone, 104 Colum. L. Rev. 975, 976, n. 7 (2004).",Thomas,0,
2021-016,51,"Fourth, Bolling asserted that because the Constitution prohibits States from racially segregating public schools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government. 347 U.S. at 500, 74 S.Ct. 693. For one, such moral judgments lie beyond the commission of the federal courts. For another, the assertion is debatable at best. The Constitution contains many limitations that apply only to the states, or only to the federal government, and this Court is not free to disregard those aspects of the constitutional design. M. McConnell, Concurring in the Judgment, in What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said 166 (J. Balkin ed. 2001) (McConnell) (footnotes omitted), see also Maggs 1052. Likewise, the enactors of the Fourteenth Amendment might have reasonably believed that an equal protection provision was not needed against the federal government because it had shown itself to be a much better protector of the rights of minorities than had the states. M. Rappaport, Originalism and the Colorblind Constitution, 89 Notre Dame L. Rev. 71, 90 (2013), see also J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 33 (1980), McConnell 167, K. Roosevelt, Forget the Fundamentals: Fixing Substantive Due Process, 8 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 983, 997 (2006).",Thomas,0,
2021-016,52,"In sum, the text and history of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause provide limited support for reading into that provision an equal protection guarantee.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,54,"Even if the Due Process Clause has no equal protection component, the Constitution may still prohibit the Federal Government from discriminating on the basis of race, at least with respect to civil rights. While my conclusions remain tentative, I think that the textual source of that obligation may reside in the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause. That Clause provides: All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. Amdt. 14, § 1, cl. 1. As I sketch out briefly below, considerable historical evidence suggests that the Citizenship Clause was adopted against a longstanding political and legal tradition that closely associated the status of `citizenship' with the entitlement to legal equality. R. Williams, Originalism and the Other Desegregation Decision, 99 Va. L. Rev. 493, 501 (2013) (Williams), see also A. Amar, Intratextualism, 112 Harv. L. Rev. 747, 768-769 (1999). Thus, the Citizenship Clause could provide a firmer foundation for Bolling's result than the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,56,"In the years before the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, jurists and legislators often connected citizenship with equality. Namely, the absence or presence of one entailed the absence or presence of the other. See Williams 513-515 (discussing political discourse during the 1820s). By the late 1850s, the connection was well established. For example, even Chief Justice TANEY in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1857), demonstrated this connection when discussing why, erroneously in my view, free blacks were not intended to be included  under the word `citizens' in the Constitution, and therefore could claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. Id., at 404. According to Taney, free blacks were at the founding considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held power and the Government might choose to grant them. Id., at 404-405.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,57,"He reached that conclusion after surveying discriminatory state laws and finding it hardly consistent with the respect due to these States, to suppose that they regarded at that time, as fellow-citizens and members of the sovereignty, a class of beings whom they had thus stigmatized and upon whom they had impressed such deep and enduring marks of inferiority and degradation. Id., at 416. Under the Comity Clause of Article IV, moreover, States could not place citizens of the United States in an inferior grade. Id., at 423. Because it was long assumed that blacks could be placed in such an inferior grade, how then could they be citizens? For Taney, then, States' longstanding and widespread practice of denying free blacks equal civil rights conclusively showed that blacks were not citizens entitled to various constitutional protections, such as the right to sue in federal court.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,58,"Senator Stephen Douglas, defending Dred Scott a few months later in Springfield, Illinois, expressed the converse of Taney's reasoning. He asked his audience, What is the object of making Dred Scott a citizen? and answered, Of course to  give him the rights, privileges and immunities of a citizen, it being the great fundamental law in our Government, that under the law, citizens are equal in their rights and privileges. Kansas—The Mormons— Slavery, in A Political Textbook for 1860, p. 155 (H. Greeley & J. Cleveland eds. 1860). Thus, Douglas recognized that the bestowal of citizenship ineluctably entailed equal civil rights. Abolitionists agreed, but, unlike Taney and Douglas, reasoned that all persons—black or white—born in the United States were citizens and therefore entitled to equal civil rights. See Williams 515-518.1",Thomas,0,
2021-016,59,"After the Civil War, the Nation again confronted the citizenship status of black Americans. Though they were no longer slaves in light of the Thirteenth Amendment, the question remained whether, by virtue of their freedom from bondage, these native-born men and women were citizens. Consistent with Taney's view in Dred Scott, southern governments rejected that free blacks were citizens and consequently enacted Black Codes that restricted freed slaves' rights to make and enforce private contracts, to own and convey real and personal property, to hold certain jobs, to seek relief in court, and to participate in common life as ordinary citizens. J. Harrison, Reconstructing the Privileges or Immunities Clause, 101 Yale L. J. 1385, 1388 (1992).",Thomas,0,
2021-016,60,"In response, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to both repudiate Dred Scott and eradicate the Black Codes. The 1866 Act contained a citizenship clause similar to the Fourteenth Amendment's: All persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States. Act of Apr. 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27. The provision immediately succeeding that citizenship guarantee clarified that such citizens, of every race and color were entitled to",Thomas,0,
2021-016,61,"the same right, in every State and Territory in the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,62,"Fleshing out the implications of the citizenship declaration, this clause suggests that the right to be free of racial discrimination with respect to the enjoyment of certain rights is a constituent part of citizenship.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,63,"Moreover, as Congress debated the 1866 Act, the view that the status of citizenship conferred upon its recipients at least some minimal level of equality rights was widely shared among both supporters and opponents. Williams 535. For instance, Representative Samuel Shellabarger argued that  the right of all citizens to be secured in the enjoyment of whatever privileges their citizenship does confer upon them is in its very nature equal . Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1293 (1866). Representative Henry Jarvis Raymond, meanwhile, wanted Congress to declare that free blacks were citizens, and thus secure to them whatever rights, immunities, privileges, and powers belong as of right to all citizens of the United States. Id., at 1266, see also ibid. (The right of citizenship involves everything else. Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States ). And after President Johnson's veto, Representative William Lawrence, the 1866 Act's principal House sponsor, maintained that the very nature of citizenship guaranteed an equality of civil rights. Id., at 1836.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,64,"The 1866 Act's reversal of Dred Scott raised questions whether Congress had such authority under the existing Constitution. See, e.g., K. Lash, The Fourteenth Amendment and the Privileges and Immunities of American Citizenship 169 (2014). Once incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, the Citizenship Clause forever closed the door on Dred Scott and constitutionalized the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Id., at 171. When Senator Jacob Howard moved to add the Citizenship Clause, he and others characterized the Clause as largely declaratory of existing law, including the 1866 Act. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2890 (remarks of Sen. Howard), see also id., at 2896 (remarks of Sen. Doolittle). Then, as Congress considered the Citizenship Clause, Republicans reiterated the same equal-citizenship principle that featured in the debates over the 1866 Act. Senator John Conness, for instance, remarked that the 1866 Act guaranteed that all born in the United States be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens of the United States. Id., at 2891, see also Williams 543-548. And during the ratification debates, Republicans continued to publicly advocate that citizenship and equal civil rights were concomitant. See id., at 549-554.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,66,"In the years following the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, several Justices also appeared to endorse this understanding of the Citizenship Clause, consistent with Reconstruction-era discourse. In the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), Justice BRADLEY's dissent articulated the equal-citizenship principle: Citizenship of the United States ought to be, and, according to the Constitution, is, a sure and undoubted title to equal rights in any and every State in this Union. Id., at 113. If a man be denied full equality before the law, he is denied one of the essential rights of citizenship as a citizen of the United States. Ibid., see also id., at 118 (Equality before the law is undoubtedly one of privileges and immunities of every citizen). Justice FIELD's dissent similarly explained that the 1866 Act rested upon the theory that citizens of the United States as such were entitled to the rights and privileges enumerated, and that to deny to any such citizen equality in these rights and privileges with others, was, to the extent of the denial, subjecting him to an involuntary servitude, i.e., rejecting his status as a citizen. Id., at 91-92.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,67,"Three years after the Slaughter-House Cases, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1875, prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. During the congressional debates over the 1875 Act, Republicans reiterated the relationship between the status of citizen and entitlement to equal civil rights. See  Williams 565-570, see also C. Green, Equal Citizenship, Civil Rights, and the Constitution 164-202 (2015) (collecting examples). In a virtually unanimous opinion, this Court held the 1875 Act unconstitutional because discrimination by public accommodations was not state action Congress could regulate under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 25-26, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883). The lone dissenter, Justice JOHN MARSHALL HARLAN, focused primarily on citizenship and echoed Republicans' understanding of equal citizenship: Citizenship in this country necessarily imports at least equality of civil rights among citizens of every race in the same State. It is fundamental in American citizenship that, in respect of such rights, there shall be no discrimination by the State  against any citizen because of his race. Id., at 48, 3 S.Ct. 18.",Thomas,0,
2021-016,68,"Only five years later, a unanimous Court in Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 16 S.Ct. 904, 40 L.Ed. 1075 (1896), seemingly confirmed Harlan's understanding of citizenship and the textual source of the equal-citizenship guarantee. Writing for the Court, Justice HARLAN declared that the Constitution of the United States, in its present form, forbids, so far as civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination by the General Government, or by the States, against any citizen because of his race. All citizens are equal before the law. Id., at 591, 16 S.Ct. 904 (emphasis added).2 The Court's reference to the Constitution in its present form (i.e., in 1896) indicates that the Court located an equality principle applicable to both the States and the General Government in the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Fifth. And because the usual textual candidates—the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause—apply only to States, it stands to reason that Gibson understood the Citizenship Clause to forbid discrimination by the Federal Government so far as civil rights are concerned. Ibid.3",Thomas,0,
2021-016,69,"The same year as Gibson, Justice HARLAN also penned his dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41  L.Ed. 256 (1896), in which the Court upheld a Louisiana law requiring racial segregation on train cars. In asserting that the law was unconstitutional, Harlan did not rely on the Equal Protection Clause. Instead, he maintained that Louisiana's law was inconsistent  with the equality of rights which pertains to citizenship, National and State. Id., at 555, 16 S.Ct. 1138. And Harlan's famous declaration underscores the connection between citizenship and equality: Our Constitution is colorblind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. Id., at 559, 16 S.Ct. 1138 (emphasis added). Given that the Equal Protection Clause speaks of persons, rather than citizens, Harlan's reasoning in Plessy suggests that citizenship itself carried with it a right to equal treatment independent of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all persons.4",Thomas,0,
2021-016,70,"Beyond its emphasis on equal citizenship, Justice HARLAN's Plessy dissent also specifically recognized that the Federal Government could not engage in racial discrimination. The Fourteenth Amendment, Harlan explained, gave citizenship to all born or naturalized in the United States, and residing here, obliterated the race line from our systems of governments, National and State, and placed our free institutions upon the broad and sure foundation of the equality of all men before the law. Id., at 563, 16 S.Ct. 1138 (emphasis added). In short, Harlan understood that citizenship and equality went hand in hand and that equal citizenship prohibited the Federal Government, as much as the States, from discriminating with respect to civil rights.",Thomas,0,

Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 384  (1872).6 The Citizenship Clause's conferral of the dignity and glory of American citizenship may well prohibit the Federal Government from denying citizens equality with respect to civil rights.

Abbott Lawrence Lowell submitted that, apart from treaty or legislation, possessions acquired by conquest or cession do not become a part of the United States, and constitutional limitations do not apply. The Status of Our New Possessions: A Third View, 13 Harv. L. Rev. 155, 176 (1899).

2021-016,79,"The debate over American colonialism made its first appearance in this Court in the form of a tax dispute in Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088 (1901). Pursuant to the Foraker Act, Congress erected a civil government in Puerto Rico and imposed a tax on goods exported to, or imported from, the new Territory. See Act of Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, §§ 2-3, 31 Stat. 77-78. After incurring a $659.35 tax bill, an importer challenged the Act as inconsistent with the Constitution's Tax Uniformity Clause, which provides that all Duties, Imposts, and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, Downes, 182 U.S. at 247, 249, 21 S.Ct. 770.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,80,"To answer the question whether the Act complied with the Constitution, the Court resolved that it first had to decide whether the Constitution applied at all in Puerto Rico. Ultimately, a fractured set of opinions emerged. Employing arguments similar to those advanced by Professors Langdell and Thayer, Justice BROWN saw things in the starkest terms. Applying the Constitution made sense in contiguous territories inhabited only by people of the same race, or by scattered bodies of native Indians. Id., at 282, 21 S.Ct. 770. But it would not do for islands inhabited by alien races, differing from us in religion, customs, laws, methods of taxation, and modes of thought. Id., at 287, 21 S.Ct. 770. There, Justice BROWN contended, the administration of government and justice, according to Anglo-Saxon principles, may for a time be impossible. Ibid. On his view, the Constitution should reach Puerto Rico only if and when Congress so directed. Id., at 279, 21 S.Ct. 770.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,81,"Justice WHITE offered a different theory that drew on Professor Lowell's thinking. See Developments in the Law—The U. S. Territories, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 1616, 1617-1620 (2017). To Justice WHITE, the Constitution's application depended on the situation of the territory and its relations to the United States. Downes, 182 U.S. at 293, 21 S.Ct. 770 (concurring opinion). In some cases, Congress might express an intention to incorporate a Territory into the United States at a future date, in a Territory like that the Constitution must apply fully and immediately. Id., at 339, 21 S.Ct. 770. But in other cases, Justice WHITE argued, only fundamental (if unspecified) aspects of the Constitution should have force. Id., at 291, 21 S.Ct. 770. In his judgment, Puerto Rico fell into this second category and remained foreign to the United States because, unlike Territories in the American West, Congress had not done enough to indicate its intention to incorporate the island. Id., at 341-342, 21 S.Ct. 770. Still, it would be a mistake to overstate the gap between the theories advanced by Justice WHITE and Justice BROWN. At bottom, both rested on a view about the Nation's right to acquire and exploit an unknown island, peopled with an uncivilized race  for commercial and strategic reasons—a right that could not be practically exercised if the result would be to endow full constitutional protections on those absolutely unfit to receive them. Id., at 306, 21 S.Ct. 770 (WHITE, J., concurring).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,82,"In dissent, Chief Justice FULLER expressed astonishment that Congress could keep a Territory, like a disembodied shade, in an intermediate state of ambiguous existence for an indefinite period. Id., at 372, 21 S.Ct. 770. Justice HARLAN criticized the Court for engrafting upon our republican institutions a colonial system such as exists under monarchical governments. Id., at 380, 21 S.Ct. 770. And Justice HARLAN dismissed Justice WHITE's supposed middle ground, which he could find nowhere in the Constitution's terms: I am constrained to say that this idea of `incorporation' has some occult meaning which my mind does not apprehend. Id., at 391, 21 S.Ct. 770.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,83,"Later decisions blurred the line between Justice BROWN's approach and Justice WHITE's even further. Eventually, a majority embraced Justice WHITE's incorporation theory, including its suggestion that certain constitutional protections are fundamental and therefore apply even in far-flung unincorporated possessions. Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138, 148-149, 24 S.Ct. 808, 49 L.Ed. 128 (1904). At the same time, it became clear that very few constitutional limits on the power of the federal government could be relied upon in the newly acquired Territories absent a clear congressional statement. See, e.g., Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U.S. 197, 215-216, 23 S.Ct. 787, 47 L.Ed. 1016 (1903) (opinion of BROWN, J.), id., at 218-219, 23 S.Ct. 787 (WHITE, J., concurring), Cf. S. Laughlin, The Burger Court and the United States Territories, 36 U. Fla. L.

2021-016,84,"Even the right to trial by jury, the Court concluded, was not fundamental enough to apply in unincorporated Territories like Puerto Rico. Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 306, 308-310, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922). It did not matter to the Court that, by the time it reached the question, Congress had already granted Puerto Ricans U. S. citizenship. See Act of Mar. 2, 1917, § 5, 39 Stat. 953. In the Court's estimation, the locality was determinative of the application of the Constitution, not the status of the people who live in it. Balzac, 258 U.S. at 309, 42 S.Ct. 343. And, on the Court's account, Puerto Rico's localities included compact and ancient communities that had not yet developed the impartial attitude or conscious duty of participation required of citizens by the Anglo-Saxon jury trial. Id., at 310, 42 S.Ct. 343.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,86,"The flaws in the Insular Cases are as fundamental as they are shameful. Nothing in the Constitution speaks of incorporated and unincorporated Territories. Nothing in it extends to the latter only certain supposedly fundamental constitutional guarantees. Nothing in it authorizes judges to engage in the sordid business of segregating Territories and the people who live in them on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,87,"The Insular Cases can claim support in academic work of the period, ugly racial stereotypes, and the theories of social Darwinists. But they have no home in our Constitution or its original understanding. In this country, the federal government derives its powers directly from the sovereign people, McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 404-405, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), and is empowered to act only in accord with the terms of the written Constitution the people have approved, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Empires and duchies in Europe may have subscribed to the doctrine  that the people were made for kings, not  kings for the people. The Federalist No. 45, p. 289 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Monarchical and despotic governments may possess the power to act unrestrained by written constitutions. Downes, 182 U.S. at 380, 21 S.Ct. 770 (HARLAN, J., dissenting). But our Nation's government has no existence except by virtue of the Constitution, and it may not ignore that charter in the Territories any more than it may in the States. Id., at 382, 21 S.Ct. 770.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,88,"The Insular Cases' departure from the Constitution's original meaning has never been much of a secret. Even commentators at the time understood that the notion of territorial incorporation was a thoroughly modern invention.1 The Insular Cases deviated, too, from this Court's prior and longstanding understanding of the Constitution. In 1898, the very same year as the Spanish-American War, a lopsided majority of this Court judged it beyond question that the Constitution's jury-trial guarantees reached the territories of the United States. Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.S. 343, 346-347, 18 S.Ct. 620, 42 L.Ed. 1061 (1898) (HARLAN, J.). Nearly 80 years before that, the Court held that the Constitution's Tax Uniformity Clause constrained legislation governing the District of Columbia. Loughborough v. Blake, 5 Wheat. 317, 319, 5 L.Ed. 98 (1820) (Marshall, C. J.). In between, this Court reached similar conclusions in case after case.2",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,89,"With the passage of time, this Court has come to admit discomfort with the Insular Cases. See Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 14, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (plurality opinion), Financial Oversight and Mgmt. Bd. for Puerto Rico v. Aurelius Investment, LLC, 590 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 1649, 1665-1666, 207 L.Ed.2d 18 (2020). But instead of confronting their errors directly, this Court has devised a workaround. Employing the specious logic of the Insular Cases, the Court has proceeded to declare fundamental— and thus applicable even to unincorporated Territories—more and more of the Constitution's guarantees. See S. Cleveland, Powers Inherent in Sovereignty: Indians, Aliens, Territories, and the Nineteenth Century Origins of Plenary Power Over Foreign Affairs, 81 Texas L. Rev. 1, 241-243 (2002) (collecting cases).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,90,"That solution is no solution. It leaves the Insular Cases on the books. Lower courts continue to feel constrained to apply their terms. See, e.g., Fitisemanu v. United States, 1 F.4th 862, 873 (C.A.10 2021), Tuaua v. United States, 788 F.3d 300, 306-307 (C.A.D.C. 2015). And the fictions of the Insular Cases on which this workaround depends are just that. What provision of the Constitution could any judge rightly declare less than fundamental? On what basis could any judge profess the right to  draw distinctions between incorporated and unincorporated Territories, terms nowhere mentioned in the Constitution and which in the past have turned on bigotry? There are no good answers to these bad questions.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,91,"This workaround, too, has proven as ineffectual as it is inappropriate. Perhaps this Court can continue to drain the Insular Cases of some of their poison by declaring provision after provision of the Constitution fundamental and thus operative in unincorporated Territories. But even one hundred years on, that pitiable job remains unfinished. Still today under this Court's cases we are asked to believe that the right to a trial by jury remains insufficiently fundamental to apply to some 3 million U. S. citizens in unincorporated Puerto Rico. At the same time, the full panoply of constitutional rights apparently applies on the Palmyra Atoll, an uninhabited patch of land in the Pacific Ocean, because it represents our Nation's only remaining incorporated Territory.3 It is an implausible and embarrassing state of affairs.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,92,"The case before us only defers a long overdue reckoning. Rather than ask the Court to overrule the Insular Cases, both sides in this litigation work from the shared premise that the equal protection guarantee under which Mr. Vaello Madero brings his claim is a fundamental feature of the Constitution and thus applies in unincorporated Territories like Puerto Rico. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11, Brief for United States 12. Proceeding on the parties' shared premise, the Court applies the Constitution and holds that the conduct challenged here does not offend its terms. All that may obviate the necessity of overruling the Insular Cases today. But it should not obscure what we know to be true about their errors, and in an appropriate case I hope the Court will soon recognize that the Constitution's application should never turn on a governmental concession or the misguided framework of the Insular Cases. Asked why he dissented in those cases year after year, Justice HARLAN replied that `no question can be settled until settled right.' Coudert 842. We should settle this question right.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-016,93,"To be sure, settling this question right would raise difficult new ones. Cases would no longer turn on the fictions of the Insular Cases but on the terms of the Constitution itself. Disputes are sure to arise about exactly which of its individual provisions applies in the Territories and how. Some of these new questions may prove hard to resolve. But at least they would be the right questions. And at least courts would employ legally justified tools to answer them, including not just the Constitution's text and its original understanding but the Nation's historical practices (or at least those uninfected by the Insular Cases). See Fitisemanu, 1 F.4th at 883 (TYMKOVICH, C. J., concurring), see also NLRB  v.

2021-016,96,"The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides a guaranteed minimum income to certain vulnerable citizens who lack the means to support themselves. If they meet uniform federal eligibility criteria, recipients are entitled to SSI regardless of their contributions, or their State's contributions, to the United States Treasury, which funds the program. Despite these broad eligibility criteria, today the Court holds that Congress' decision to exclude citizen residents of Puerto Rico from this important safety-net program is consistent with the Fifth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. I disagree. In my view, there is no rational basis for Congress to treat needy citizens living anywhere in the United States so differently from others. To hold otherwise, as the Court does, is irrational and antithetical to the very nature of the SSI program and the equal protection of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-016,98,"Congress' enactment of the SSI program in 1972 represented a major change in the Federal Government's relationship with States and Territories in assisting low-income individuals. Prior to 1972, means-based assistance for people over the age of 64, blind people, or those with disabilities came in the form of programs administered and funded by States and supplemented with matching federal funds. See S. Rep. No. 92-1230, pp. 383-384. One of those programs was known as Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD). Under AABD, the States and Territories set their own income and asset limits for individual participation and determined their own benefit amounts. See Brief for Public Benefits Scholars as Amici Curiae 27. The Federal Government paid 75% of the benefits and 50% of the administrative costs, subject to a statutory cap on total expenditures.

2021-016,99,"To provide a uniform, guaranteed minimum income for the neediest adults, Congress  established the SSI program in 1972. In creating the SSI program, Congress displaced the States.

Rather than dispensing money through block grants to the States, SSI provides monthly cash benefits directly to qualifying low-income individuals who are over 65 years old, blind, or disabled. The Federal Government sets uniform qualifications for eligibility and fully funds the program through mandatory appropriations from the general fund of the United States Treasury. See 42 U.S.C. § 1381 et seq. Unlike AABD benefits, SSI benefits do not vary based on the specific State or Territory that a beneficiary is located in, as long as the beneficiary is otherwise eligible.1 In sum, SSI created a fully nationalized assistance program with federal administration, federal determination of eligibility, and financed entirely from federal funds.",Sotomayor,0,

Rosario, 446 U.S. 651, 100 S.Ct. 1929, 64 L.Ed.2d 587 (1980) (per curiam), require acceptance of this rationale. Ante, at 1542-1543. It is true that both Califano and Harris relied on Puerto Rico's tax status to justify the unequal treatment of its residents. See Califano, 435 U.S. at 5, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 906, Harris, 446 U.S. at 652, 100 S.Ct. 1929. Neither case, however, stood for the principle that Puerto Rico's tax status could justify any and all unequal treatment of its residents, and neither addressed the claims at issue here. Califano resolved a claim under the right to travel, while Harris decided a challenge to the unequal distribution of block grants to the States and Puerto Rico under a separate benefits program. Those cases do not preclude an equal protection challenge to a uniform, federalized, direct-to-individual poverty reduction program like SSI. Moreover, as summary dispositions, Califano and Harris are not of the same precedential value as would be an opinion of this Court treating the question on the merits. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).

Califano, 435 U.S. at 5, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 906, Harris, 446 U.S. at 652, 100 S.Ct. 1929. Here, the United States concedes that residents of Puerto Rico make some contributions to the federal treasury. Brief for United States 19 (emphasis deleted).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-016,117,"Moreover, the Court overlooks the fact that SSI establishes a direct relationship between the recipient and the Federal Government. The Federal Government develops  uniform eligibility criteria, recipients apply for assistance directly to the Federal Government, and the Federal Government disburses funds directly and uniformly to recipients without regard to where they reside. Indeed, when it created SSI, Congress replaced existing programs that differed between States as well as between States and Territories and that involved States and Territories in administering the programs. Under the current system, the jurisdiction in which an SSI recipient resides has no bearing at all on the purposes or requirements of the SSI program. For this reason alone, it is irrational to tie an individual's entitlement to SSI to that individual's place of residency.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-016,118,"While it is true that residents of Puerto Rico typically are exempt from paying some federal taxes,5 that distinction does not create a rational basis to distinguish between them and other SSI recipients. By definition, SSI recipients pay few if any taxes at all, as the First Circuit correctly recognized below: By its very terms, only low-income individuals lacking in monetary resources are eligible for SSI. 956 F.3d at 27. In fact, to qualify for SSI, recipients must have an income well below the standard deduction for single tax filers. Ibid.

It bears noting that tax status did not preclude Congress' extension of SSI to the Northern Mariana Islands, undermining that justification as a rational basis to distinguish Puerto Rico from the States. In any event, the Court identifies no federal program other than SSI that operates in such a uniform, nationalized, and direct manner. For instance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is administered by local governments. See Brief for Public Benefits Scholars as Amici Curiae 8-9.

The court explained that the on/off premises distinction did not impose greater restrictions for political messages, religious messages, or any other subject matter, and did not require a viewer to evaluate the topic, idea, or viewpoint on the sign, instead, it required the viewer only to determine whether the subject matter is located on the same property as the sign. 377 F.Supp.3d at 681. The court therefore held that the distinction was a facially content-neutral regulation based on location. Ibid. The court further found no evidence in the record that the City had applied the sign code provisions differently for different messages or speakers or that its stated concern for esthetics and safety was pretext for any other purpose. Id., at 681-682. Accordingly, the court reviewed the City's on-/off-premises distinction under the standard of intermediate scrutiny applicable to content-neutral regulations of speech. Id., at 682. The court found that the distinction satisfied this standard. Id., at 682-683.",Sotomayor,0,

The court opined that because the City's on-/off-premises distinction required a reader to inquire who is the speaker and what is the speaker saying, both hallmarks of a content-based inquiry, the distinction was content based. Id., at 706. It reasoned that the fact that a government official has to read a sign's message to determine the sign's purpose is enough to render a regulation content based and subject it to strict scrutiny.

Reed, 576 U.S. at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The Court of Appeals interpreted Reed to mean that if a reader must ask: who is the speaker and what is the speaker saying to apply a regulation, then the regulation is automatically content based. 972 F.3d at 706. This rule, which holds that a regulation cannot be content neutral if it requires reading the sign at issue, is too extreme an interpretation of this Court's precedent. Unlike the regulations at issue in Reed, the City's off-premises distinction requires an examination of speech only in service of drawing neutral, location-based lines. It is agnostic as to content. Thus, absent a content-based purpose or justification, the City's distinction is content neutral and does not warrant the application of strict scrutiny.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,44,"The Reed Court confronted a very different regulatory scheme than the one at issue here: a comprehensive sign code that singled out specific subject matter for differential treatment. 576 U.S. at 169, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The town of Gilbert, Arizona, had adopted a code that applied distinct size, placement, and time restrictions to 23 different categories of signs. Id., at 159, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The Court focused its analysis on three categories defined by whether the signs displayed ideological, political, or certain temporary directional messages. The code gave the most favorable treatment to `Ideological Signs,' defined as those `communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes' with certain exceptions. Id., at 159-160, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (alteration in original).",Sotomayor,0,

Rejecting the contention that the restrictions were content neutral because they did not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, the Court explained: It is well established that `the First Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.' Id., at 169, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 530, 537, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)), accord, e.g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (explaining that the central problem with a municipality's effort to exempt labor picketing from a prohibition on picketing near public schools was that it describes permissible picketing in terms of its subject matter), Carey v.

For example, a law banning the use of sound trucks for political speech—and only political speech—would be a content-based regulation, even if it imposed no limits on the political viewpoints that could be expressed. 576 U.S. at 169, 135 S.Ct. 2218. By treating ideological messages more favorably than political messages, and both more favorably than temporary directional messages, the Town's Sign Code likewise singled out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it did not target viewpoints within that subject matter.

2021-017,47,"In this case, enforcing the City's challenged sign code provisions requires reading a billboard to determine whether it directs readers to the property on which it stands or to some other, offsite location. Unlike the sign code at issue in Reed, however, the City's provisions at issue here do not single out any topic or subject matter for differential treatment. A sign's substantive message itself is irrelevant to the application of the provisions, there are no content-discriminatory classifications for political messages, ideological messages, or directional messages concerning specific events, including those sponsored by religious and nonprofit organizations. Rather, the City's provisions distinguish based on location: A given sign is treated  differently based solely on whether it is located on the same premises as the thing being discussed or not. The message on the sign matters only to the extent that it informs the sign's relative location. The on-/off-premises distinction is therefore similar to ordinary time, place, or manner restrictions. Reed does not require the application of strict scrutiny to this kind of location-based regulation. Cf. Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 482, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (sustaining an ordinance that prohibited only picketing focused on, and taking place in front of, a particular residence as content neutral).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,49,This Court's First Amendment precedents and doctrines have consistently recognized that restrictions on speech may require some evaluation of the speech and nonetheless remain content neutral.,Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,50,"Most relevant here, the First Amendment allows for regulations of solicitation —that is, speech requesting or seeking to obtain something or an attempt or effort to gain business. Black's Law Dictionary 1677 (11th ed. 2019). To identify whether speech entails solicitation, one must read or hear it first. Even so, the Court has reasoned that restrictions on solicitation are not content based and do not inherently present the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view, so long as they do not discriminate based on topic, subject matter, or viewpoint. Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 649, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,51,"Thus, in 1940, the Court invalidated a statute prohibiting solicitation for religious causes but observed that States were free to regulate the time and manner of solicitation generally, in the interest of public safety, peace, comfort or convenience. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 306-307, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213. Decades later, the Court reviewed just such a time, place, and manner regulation restricting all solicitation at the Minnesota State Fair, as well as all sale or distribution of merchandise, to a specific location. Heffron, 452 U.S. at 643-644, 101 S.Ct. 2559. The State had applied the restriction against a religious practice that included soliciting donations for the support of the Krishna religion. Id., at 645, 101 S.Ct. 2559. As a result, members of the religion were free to roam the fairgrounds and discuss their beliefs, but they were prohibited from asking for donations for their cause outside of a designated location. Id., at 646, 655, 101 S.Ct. 2559. The Court upheld the State's application of this restriction as content neutral, emphasizing that it applied evenhandedly to all who wished  to solicit funds, whether for commercial or charitable reasons. Id., at 649, 101 S.Ct. 2559.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,52,"Consistent with these precedents, the Court has previously understood distinctions between on-premises and off-premises signs, like the one at issue in this case, to be content neutral. In 1978, the Court summarily dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question where a state court had approved of an on-/off-premises distinction as a permissible time, place, and manner restriction under the Free Speech Clause. Suffolk Outdoor Advertising Co. v. Hulse, 439 U.S. 808, 99 S.Ct. 66, 58 L.Ed.2d 101 (1978). Three years later, the Court upheld in relevant part an ordinance that prohibited all off-premises commercial advertising but allowed on-premises commercial advertising. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 503-512, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d  800 (1981) (plurality opinion).5 The Metromedia Court did not need to decide whether the off-premises prohibition was content based, as it regulated only commercial speech and so was subject to intermediate scrutiny in any event. See id., at 507-512, 101 S.Ct. 2882 (citing Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U.S. 557, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980)). Shortly thereafter, however, the Court applied the relevant portion of Metromedia and described the off-premises prohibition as a content-neutral prohibition against the use of billboards. Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 807, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984) (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,53,"Underlying these cases and others is a rejection of the view that any examination of speech or expression inherently triggers heightened First Amendment concern. Rather, it is regulations that discriminate based on the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed that are content based. Reed, 576 U.S. at 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The sign code provisions challenged here do not discriminate on those bases.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,55,"Reagan does not claim Reed expressly or implicitly overturned the precedents discussed above. Its argument relies primarily on one sentence in Reed recognizing that some facial distinctions based on a message are obvious, defining regulated speech by particular subject matter, and others are more subtle, defining regulated speech by its function or purpose. Id., at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Seizing on this reference, Reagan asserts that the City's sign code defines off-premises signs based on their `function or purpose.' Brief for Respondent Reagan 20 (quoting Reed, 576 U.S. at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218). It asks the Court to reaffirm that, where a regulation `defines regulated speech by its function or purpose,' it is content-based on its face and thus subject to strict scrutiny.

2021-017,56,"The argument stretches Reed's function or purpose language too far. The principle the Reed Court articulated is more straightforward. While overt subject-matter discrimination is facially content based (for example, `Ideological Signs,' defined as those `communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes'), so, too, are subtler forms of discrimination that achieve identical results based on function or purpose (for example, `Political Signs,' defined as those `designed to influence the outcome of an election'). Id., at 159, 160, 163-164, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (alterations in original). In other words, a regulation of speech cannot escape classification as facially content based simply by swapping an obvious subject-matter distinction for a function or purpose proxy that achieves the same result. That does not mean that any classification that considers function or purpose is always content based. Such a reading of function or purpose would contravene numerous precedents, including many of those discussed above. Reed did not purport to cast doubt on these cases.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-017,57,"Nor did Reed cast doubt on the Nation's history of regulating off-premises signs. Off-premises billboards of the sort that predominate today were not present in the founding era, but as large outdoor advertisements  proliferated in the 1800s, regulation followed. As early as 1932, the Court had already approved a location-based differential for advertising signs. See Packer Corp., 285 U.S. at 107, 110, 52 S.Ct. 273. Thereafter, for the last 50-plus years, federal, state, and local jurisdictions have repeatedly relied upon on-/off-premises distinctions to address the distinct safety and esthetic challenges posed by billboards and other methods of outdoor advertising. See supra, at 1469. The unbroken tradition of on-/off-premises distinctions counsels against the adoption of Reagan's novel rule. See Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 446, 135 S.Ct. 1656, 191 L.Ed.2d 570 (2015) (recognizing history and tradition of regulation as relevant when considering the scope of the First Amendment).6",Sotomayor,0,

Post, at 1473, 1474, 1474-1475 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Nor do we cast doubt on any of our precedents recognizing examples of topic or subject-matter discrimination as content based. See, e.g., post, at 1473-1474. We merely apply those precedents to reach the commonsense result that a location-based and content-agnostic on-/off-premises distinction does not, on its face, single out specific subject matter for differential treatment.

I write separately because I continue to believe that the Court's reasoning in Reed was wrong. The Court there struck down a city's sign ordinance under the First Amendment. It wrote that the First Amendment requires strict scrutiny whenever a regulation targets speech based on its communicative content. Id., at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218.

Its purposes are often better served when judge-made categories (like content discrimination) are treated, not as bright-line rules, but instead as rules of thumb.

Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 421, 108 S.Ct. 1886, 100 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988) (The First Amendment was `fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people').",Breyer,0,
2021-017,71,"Courts help to protect these democratic values in part by strictly scrutinizing certain categories of laws that threaten to `drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.' R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 387, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). We have recognized, for example, that First Amendment values are in danger when the government imposes restrictions upon `core political speech,' Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 186-187, 119 S.Ct. 636, 142 L.Ed.2d 599 (1999), when it discriminates against particular views taken by speakers on a subject, Rosenberger v.

2021-017,72,"But not all laws that distinguish between speech based on its content fall into a category of this kind. That is in part because many ordinary regulatory programs may well turn on the content of speech without posing any realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. R. A. V., 505 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2538. Those regulations, rather than hindering the ability of the people to transmit their thoughts to their elected representatives, may constitute the very product of that transmission. Barr, 591 U.

2021-017,73,"The U. S. Code (as well as its state and local equivalents) is filled with regulatory laws that turn, often necessarily, on the content of speech.

2021-017,74,"If Reed is taken as setting forth a formal rule that courts must strictly scrutinize regulations simply because they refer to particular content, we have good reason to fear the consequences of that decision. One possibility is that courts will strike down `entirely reasonable' regulations that reflect the will of the people. Reed, 576 U.S. at 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218, e.g., Barr, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2361-2362 (striking down the Telephone Consumer Protection Act's exception allowing robocalls that collect government debt), IMDB. com v.

If so, the Court's content-based line-drawing will substitute judicial for democratic decisionmaking and threaten the ability of the people to translate their ideas into policy.

2021-017,75,"A second possibility is that courts instead will (perhaps unconsciously) dilute the stringent strict scrutiny standard in an effort to avoid striking down reasonable regulations.

2021-017,76,"A third possibility is that courts will develop a matrix of formal subsidiary rules and exceptions that seek to distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable content-based regulations.

Id., at 176, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Instead, I would treat content discrimination as a rule of thumb to be applied with what Justice KAGAN has called a dose of common sense. Id., at 183, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (opinion concurring in judgment). Where content-based regulations are at issue, I would ask a more basic First Amendment question: Does the regulation at issue work harm to First Amendment interests that is disproportionate in light of the relevant regulatory objectives? Id., at 179, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (opinion of BREYER, J.). I believe we should answer that question by examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, the extent to which the law will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so.

Regulation of outdoor advertising in order to protect the public's interest in avoiding visual clutter, Members  of City Council of Los Angeles v.

San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 507-508, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981), is unlikely to interfere significantly with the marketplace of ideas. In this case, for example, there is no evidence that the City regulated off-premises signs in order to censor a particular viewpoint or topic, or that its regulations have had that effect in practice. There is consequently little reason to apply a presumption of unconstitutionality to this kind of regulation.",Breyer,0,
2021-017,83,"Without such a presumption, I would weigh the First Amendment harms that a regulation imposes against the regulatory objectives that it serves. The City's regulation here appears to work at most a limited, niche-like harm to First Amendment interests. Respondents own a number of grandfathered off-premises signs. They can use those signs to communicate whatever messages they choose. They complain only that they cannot digitize the signs, which would allow them to display several messages in rapid succession. Perhaps digitization would enable them to make more effective use of their billboard space. But their inability to maximize the use of their space in this way is unlikely to meaningfully interfere with their participation in the marketplace of ideas.",Breyer,0,
2021-017,84,"At the same time, the City has asserted a legitimate interest in maintaining the regulation. As I have said, the public has an interest in ensuring traffic safety and preserving an esthetically pleasing environment, supra this page, and the City here has reasonably explained how its regulation of off-premises signs in general, and digitization in particular, serves those interests. Amici tell us that billboards, especially digital ones, can distract drivers and cause accidents. See, e.g., Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21 (citing a study of 450 crashes in Alabama and Florida that revealed that the presence of digital billboards increased the overall crash rates in areas of billboard influence), Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 22 (`The Wisconsin Department of Transport found a 35% increase in collisions near a variable message sign' (alteration omitted)). They add that on-premises signs are less likely to cause accidents. Id., at 23 (A 2014 study found no evidence that on premises digital signs led to an increase in crashes).

2021-017,87,"I agree with the majority that we must reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals holding that the provisions of the Austin City Code regulating on- and off-premises signs are facially unconstitutional. Ante, at 1471-1472. The Court of Appeals reasoned that those provisions impose content-based restrictions and that they cannot satisfy strict scrutiny, but the Court of Appeals did not apply the tests that must be met before a law is held to be facially unconstitutional. Normally, a plaintiff bringing a facial challenge must `establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the law would be valid,' or show that the law lacks `a plainly legitimate sweep.' Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2373, 2387, 210 L.Ed.2d 716 (2021) (citation omitted). A somewhat less  demanding test applies when a law affects freedom of speech. Under our First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, a law restricting speech is unconstitutional if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Alito,0,
2021-017,88,"In this case, the Court of Appeals did not apply either of those tests, and it is doubtful that they can be met. Many (and possibly the great majority) of the situations in which the relevant provisions may apply involve commercial speech, and under our precedents, regulations of commercial speech are analyzed differently. See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 571-572, 131 S.Ct. 2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011).",Alito,0,
2021-017,89,"It is also questionable whether those code provisions are unconstitutional as applied to most of respondents' billboards. It appears that most if not all of those billboards are located off-premises in both the usual sense of that term,1 and in the sense in which the term is used in the Austin code. See Austin, Tex., City Code § 25-10-3(11) (2016) (a sign is off-premises if it advertises a business, person, activity, goods, products, or services not located on the site where the sign is installed or if it directs persons to any location not on that site). The record contains photos of some of these billboards, see App. 130-147, and all but one appears to be located on otherwise vacant land. Thus, they are clearly off-premises signs, and because they were erected before the enactment of the code provisions at issue, the only relevant restriction they face is that they cannot be digitized.2 The distinction between a digitized and non-digitized sign is not based on content, topic, or subject matter. Even if the message on a billboard were written in a secret code, an observer would have no trouble determining whether it had been digitized.",Alito,0,
2021-017,90,"Because the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the code provisions are facially unconstitutional, I agree that we should reverse that decision. On remand, the lower courts should determine whether those provisions are unconstitutional as applied to each of the billboards at issue.",Alito,0,
2021-017,91,"Today's decision, however, goes further and holds flatly that the sign code provisions challenged here do not discriminate on the basis of `the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed,' ante, at 1474, and that categorical statement is incorrect. The provisions defining on- and off-premises signs clearly discriminate on those grounds, and at least as applied in some situations, strict scrutiny should be required.",Alito,0,
2021-017,92,"As the Court notes, under the provisions in effect when petitioner's applications were denied, a sign was considered to be off-premises if it advertised, among other things, a person, activity,  or service not located on the site where the sign is installed or if it directed persons to any location not on that site. Austin, Tex., City Code § 25-10-3(11). Consider  what this definition would mean as applied to signs posted in the front window of a commercial establishment, say, a little coffee shop. If the owner put up a sign advertising a new coffee drink, the sign would be classified as on-premises, but suppose the owner instead mounted a sign in the same location saying: Contribute to X's legal defense fund or Free COVID tests available at Y pharmacy or Attend City Council meeting to speak up about Z. All those signs would appear to fall within the definition of an off-premises sign and would thus be disallowed. See also post, at 3-4 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Providing disparate treatment for the sign about a new drink and the signs about social and political matters constitutes discrimination on the basis of topic or subject matter. The code provisions adopted in 2017 are worded differently, but the new wording may not rule out similar results.3",Alito,0,

Id., at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Here, the city of Austin imposes special restrictions on off-premises signs, defined as signs that advertise a business, person, activity, goods, products, or services not located on the site where the sign is installed, or that direct persons to any location not on that site. Austin, Tex., City Code § 25-10-3(11) (2016). Under Reed, Austin's off-premises restriction is content based.

2021-017,100,"In Reed v. Town of Gilbert, we held that courts should identify content-based restrictions by applying a commonsense test: A speech regulation is content based if it targets speech based on its communicative content. 576 U.S. at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Put another way, a law is content based `on its face' if it draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys. Ibid. While we noted that some facial distinctions based on a message are obvious, we emphasized that others could be more subtle, defining regulated speech by its function or purpose. Ibid. In all events, whether a law is characterized as targeting a topic, idea, subject matter, or communicative content, the law is content based if it draws distinctions based in any way on the message a speaker conveys. Id., at 163-164, 135 S.Ct. 2218.2",Thomas,0,
2021-017,101,"Applying this standard, we held that the town of Gilbert's sign code was a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination because it classified various categories of signs based on the type of information they conveyed, and then subjected each category to different restrictions. Id., at 169, 159, 135 S.Ct. 2218. For instance, Gilbert defined `Temporary Directional Signs' as any sign that conveyed the message of directing the public to a `qualifying event,' and permitted their display for no more than 12 hours before and 1 hour after the event occurred. Id., at 164, 161, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Meanwhile, `Ideological Signs,' defined as any sign (not covered by another  category) that `communicated a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes,' were subject to no temporal limitations. Id., at 159-160, 135 S.Ct. 2218. In short, the restrictions on any given sign depended on the communicative content of the sign. Id., at 164, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Gilbert's sign code was thus facially content based and presumptively unlawful. See id., at 159, 135 S.Ct. 2218.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,102,"In contrast to Reed's commonsense test, Gilbert urged us to define content based as a term of art that `should be applied flexibly' with the goal of protecting `viewpoints and ideas from government censorship or favoritism.' Id., at 168, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Such a functionalist test, Gilbert argued, could ferret out illicit government motives while obviating the need to subject reasonable laws to strict scrutiny. See ibid. We rejected Gilbert's attempt to cast the phrase content based as a term of art because innocent motives do not eliminate the danger of censorship presented by a facially content-based statute. Id., at 167, 135 S.Ct. 2218. We noted that one could easily imagine a Sign Code compliance manager who disliked a Church's substantive teachings deploying the Sign Code to make it more difficult for the Church to inform the public of the location of its services. Id., at 167-168, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Thus, we concluded that a clear and firm rule governing content neutrality is an essential means of protecting the freedom of speech, even if laws that might seem entirely reasonable will sometimes be struck down because of their content-based nature. Id., at 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-017,103,"We also rejected the Ninth Circuit's reasoning that Gilbert's sign restrictions were content neutral because they depended on the content-neutral elements of  whether and when an event is occurring. Id., at 169, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is, whether a temporary directional sign was permissible depended, in part, on its temporal proximity to a `qualifying event.' Id., at 164, 135 S.Ct. 2218. This partial dependence on content-neutral elements was immaterial, we explained, because the restrictions also depended on the signs' communicative content. Gilbert officials still had to examine a sign's message to determine what type of sign it was, and this obvious content-based inquiry did not evade strict scrutiny simply because an event was involved. Id., at 170, 135 S.Ct. 2218.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,105,"Under Reed's approach for identifying content-based regulations, Austin's off-premises sign restriction is content based. As relevant to this suit, Austin's sign code imposes stringent restrictions on a category of off-premises signs. § 25-10-3(11). The code defines off-premises signs as those advertising a business, person, activity, goods, products, or services not located on the site where the sign is installed, or as signs directing persons to any location not on that site. Ibid. This broad definition sweeps in a wide swath of signs, from 14- by 48-foot billboards to 24- by 18-inch yard signs. The sign code prohibits new off-premises signs and makes it difficult (or impossible) to change existing off-premises signs, including by digitizing them. See ante, at 1469-1470.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,106,"Like the town of Gilbert in Reed, Austin has identified a category of signs based on the type of information they convey, and then subjected that category to different restrictions. 576 U.S. at 159, 135 S.Ct. 2218. A sign that conveys a message about off-premises activities is restricted, while one that conveys a message about on-premises activities is not. See id., at 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (regulating signs based  on a particular message about the time and location of a specific event is content based). And, per Reed, it does not matter that Austin's code defines regulated speech by its function or purpose—i.e., advertising or directing passersby elsewhere. Id., at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. Again, all that matters is that the regulation draws distinctions based on a sign's communicative content, which the off-premises restriction plainly does. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,107,"This conclusion is not undermined because the off-premises sign restriction depends in part on a content-neutral element: the location of the sign. Much like in Reed, that an Austin official applying the sign code must know where the sign is does not negate the fact that he also must know what the sign says. Take, for instance, a sign outside a Catholic bookstore. If the sign says, Visit the Holy Land, it is likely an off-premises sign because it conveys a message directing people elsewhere (unless the name of the bookstore is Holy Land Books). But if the sign instead says, Buy More Books, it is likely a permissible on-premises sign (unless the sign also contains the address of another bookstore across town). Finally, suppose the sign says, Go to Confession. After examining the sign's message, an official would need to inquire whether a priest ever hears confessions at that location. If one does, the sign could convey a permissible on-premises message. If not, the sign conveys an impermissible off-premises message. Because enforcing the sign code in any of these instances requires Austin officials to determine whether a sign conveys a particular message, the sign code is content based under Reed. Id., at 170, 135 S.Ct. 2218.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,108,"In sum, the off-premises rule is content based and thus invalid unless Austin can satisfy strict scrutiny. See Playboy Entertainment Group, 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878.

2021-017,110,"To reach the opposite result, the majority implicitly rewrites Reed's bright-line rule for content-based restrictions. In the majority's view, the off-premises restriction is not content based because it does not target a specific topic or subject matter. Ante, at 1472. The upshot of the majority's reasoning appears to be that a regulation based on a sufficiently general or broad category of communicative content is not actually content based.",Thomas,0,

Tellingly, the only decision that even remotely supports the majority's rule is one it does not cite: Hill v. Colorado. There, the Court held that an undeniably content-based law was nonetheless content neutral because it discriminated against an extremely broad category of communications, supposedly without regard to subject matter. 530 U.S. at 723, 120 S.Ct. 2480. The majority's decision today is erroneous for the same reasons that Hill is an aberration in our case law.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,113,"The majority concedes that the message on the sign matters when applying Austin's sign code. Ante, at 1472. That concession should end the inquiry under Reed.

2021-017,114,"For example, while Reed defined content-based restrictions as those that draw distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys, 576 U.S. at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (emphasis added), the majority decides that Austin's sign code is not content based because it draws no distinctions based on a sign's substantive message, ante, at 1472 (emphasis added). Elsewhere, the majority speaks not of substantive messages but of topics or subject matters, which the majority thinks are sufficiently specific categories of communicative content. Ibid. As a result, the majority contends that a law targeting directional messages concerning events generally, regardless of topic, would not be content based, but one targeting directional messages concerning specific events (e.g., religious or political events) would be. Ante, at 1475, n. 6, 1472 (emphasis added).3 Regardless of the label, the majority today excises, without a word of explanation, a subset of supposedly non-substantive or unspecific messages from the First Amendment's protection against content-based restrictions.",Thomas,0,

Springfield, 806 F.3d 411, 412 (CA7 2015) (Reed effectively abolishes any distinction between content regulation and subject-matter regulation.

Only by jettisoning Reed's commonsense definition of what it means to be content based can the majority assert that the off-premises rule is strictly location-based and agnostic as to content, ante, at 1471, even though the law undeniably depends on both location and communicative content, supra, at 1470-1471.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,116,"Moreover, the majority's suggestion that laws targeting broad categories of communicative content are not content based is hard to square with the sign categories that Reed invalidated. For instance, we found Gilbert's expansive definition of Ideological Signs to be content based even though it broadly covered any sign communicating a message or ideas for non-commercial purposes that did not already fall into one of the other categories. 576 U.S. at 159, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor did we suggest that the outcome in Reed would have been different if the sign categories were defined even more generally.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,117,"The majority answers that it is not fashioning a novel `specificity test,' but instead simply quoting the standard repeatedly enunciated in Reed. Ante, at 1475. The majority finds this alleged specificity test in a paragraph near the end of Reed, where we noted that a law targeted at specific subject matter is content based even if it does not discriminate among viewpoints within that subject matter, and then affirmed that Gilbert's sign code singled out specific subject matter for differential treatment. 576 U.S. at 169, 135 S.Ct. 2218.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,118,"These statements never purported to endorse a specificity test of the sort now suggested by the majority. Read in context, Reed's two references to specific subject matter naturally address laws  that target a subject matter, however broadly defined, as opposed to some other subject matter, they did not refer only to laws targeting some sufficiently specific category of subject matter. Moreover, the concept of specificity or generality appears nowhere in the part of Reed that set forth its commonsense test for content neutrality. See id., at 163-164, 135 S.Ct. 2218. If Reed's content-neutrality test turned on specificity, we would have said so explicitly when stating the test. Finally, even crediting the majority's strained reading of Reed's passing references to specific subject matter, the paragraph where they appear made clear that it was describing only a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination. Id., at 169, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (emphasis added). That part of Reed never professed to announce a comprehensive rule with respect to all laws targeting speech based on its communicative content.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,119,"Our pre-Reed precedents likewise foreclose a construction of content based that applies only to some content. We have held many capacious speech regulations to be content based, including restrictions on `advice or assistance derived from scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge,' Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 12-13, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010), `advertising, promotion, or any activity  used to influence sales or the market share of a prescription drug,' Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 559, 131 S.Ct. 2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011), editorializing, FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 382-383, and n. 14, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984), `publication for philatelic, numismatic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes,' Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 644, 104 S.Ct. 3262, 82 L.Ed.2d 487 (1984), and anonymous speech, McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 348, 357, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995). These speech categories are no more specific or substantive than messages regarding off-premises activities. And some of these examples, like editorializing or publishing newsworthy information, are clearly less so. What unites these speech restrictions is that their application turns on the nature of the message being conveyed, Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 461, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980), not whether they regulate specific or general categories of speech, or whether they address substantive or non-substantive categories of speech.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,120,"We have defined content-based restrictions to include all content-based distinctions because any other rule would be incoherent. After all, off-premises advertising could be considered a subject or a topic as those words are ordinarily used. See L. D. Management Co. v. Gray, 988 F.3d 836, 839 (CA6 2021) (off-premises billboard restriction turns on the `topic discussed' (emphasis added)). And, in any event, there is no principled way to decide whether a category of communicative content is substantive or specific enough for the majority to deem it a topic or subject worthy of heightened protection. Although off-premises advertising is a more general category of speech than some (e.g., off-premises advertising of religious events), it is a more specific category than others (e.g., advertising generally). The majority offers only its own ipse dixit to explain why off-premises advertising is insufficiently specific to qualify as content based under Reed. Worse still, the majority does not explain how courts should draw the line between a sufficiently substantive or specific content-based classification and one that is insufficiently substantive or specific.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,121,"On this point, Austin suggests there is no need to worry because our cases provide  guideposts from which one can divine what level of generality renders a speech regulation content based. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18, 24. To be sure, that is the sort of inquiry the majority's opaque test invites. But Reed directed us elsewhere— to the text of the law in question and whether that law `on its face' draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys. 576 U.S. at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The majority's holding that some rules based on content are not, as it turns out, content based nullifies Reed's clear test.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,123,"The majority offers several reasons why its approach is consistent with Reed and other cases. None of these arguments is persuasive. Instead, they only serve to underscore the Court's ill-advised departure from our doctrine.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,125,"The majority first suggests that deeming Austin's sign code content based would require us to adopt an extreme reinterpretation of Reed. Ante, at 1471. Specifically, the majority faults the Court of Appeals for concluding that Austin's regulation was content based because, to enforce the off-premises rule, `a reader must ask: who is the speaker and what is the speaker saying'? Ibid. (quoting 972 F.3d 696, 706 (CA5 2020)). In the majority's view, Reed cannot stand for such a simplistic read-the-sign test.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,126,"The majority's skepticism is misplaced. We have often acknowledged that the need to examine the content of a message is a strong indicator that a speech regulation is content based. One year before Reed, for example, we stated that an abortion clinic buffer-zone law would be content based if it required enforcement authorities to examine the content of the message that is conveyed to determine whether a violation has occurred. McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S. 464, 479, 134 S.Ct. 2518, 189 L.Ed.2d 502 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). That statement was not an outlier. See, e.g., Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 230, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987) (tax exemption for periodicals uniformly devoted to religion or sports was content based because it required state officials to examine the content of the message (internal quotation marks omitted)), Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 134, 112 S.Ct. 2395, 120 L.Ed.2d 101 (1992) (regulation requiring parade organizers to pay a fee depending on the security costs anticipated for the event was content based because in order to assess accurately the cost of security for parade participants, the administrator must necessarily examine the content of the message that is conveyed (internal quotation marks omitted)), League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 366, 383, 104 S.Ct. 3106 (law forbidding public broadcasting stations from engaging in editorializing was content based because it required enforcement authorities to necessarily examine the content of the message that is conveyed (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Thomas,0,
2021-017,127,"Ultimately, the majority's objection to the Court of Appeals' reliance on a read-the-sign test is a red herring, its real objection is to Reed's rule that any law that draws distinctions based on communicative content is content based.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,129,"The majority next argues that Austin's sign code is content neutral under our precedents. See ante, at 1472-1474. But none of the cases the majority cites supports its crabbed view of what constitutes a content-based restriction.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,130,"First, in Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,131,"640, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981), the Court upheld, as content neutral, an ordinance providing that the sale or distribution of any merchandise, including printed or written material, could occur only from certain booths at the fairgrounds. Id., at 643, 101 S.Ct. 2559 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such a statute is facially content neutral under Reed because it does not `on its face' draw distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys when selling or distributing merchandise subject to the ordinance. 576 U.S. at 163, 135 S.Ct. 2218. True, the Court construed the ordinance also to limit fund solicitation operations, 452 U.S. at 644, 101 S.Ct. 2559, but that was not, as the majority claims, a prohibition on asking for donations, ante, at 1473. Rather, anyone was free to ask for donations wherever he liked, because the ordinance did not prevent respondents from wandering throughout the fairgrounds and directing interested donors or purchasers to their booth. 452 U.S. at 664, n. 2, 101 S.Ct. 2559 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Then, once at the booth, the donor could make a contribution. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,132,"Second, in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), the Court invalidated a licensing system for religious and charitable solicitation while acknowledging in dicta that a State could regulate the time, place, and manner of solicitation. Id., at 304, 307, 60 S.Ct. 900. But here, we are not faced with a true time, place, or manner restriction, as even the majority concedes. See ante, at 1472.4 And, in any event, Cantwell did not suggest that a content-based restriction could be sustained as a time, place, or manner restriction, its analysis focused predominantly on the plaintiff's free exercise claim, and the case predated our modern content-neutrality doctrine by nearly three decades. Thus, nothing in Heffron or Cantwell supports the majority's narrow approach to identifying content-based restrictions.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,133,"Finally, the majority argues that we have previously understood distinctions between on-premises and off-premises signs  to be content neutral. Ante, at 1473. To be sure, in both Suffolk Outdoor Adv. Co. v. Hulse, 439 U.S. 808, 99 S.Ct. 66, 58 L.Ed.2d 101 (1978), and Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 503-512, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (plurality opinion), this Court suggested that some restrictions on off-premises advertising were constitutional. And later, in Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), the Court described Metromedia as upholding a content-neutral prohibition against the use of billboards. 466 U.S. at 807, 104 S.Ct. 2118 (emphasis added). But the statement in Vincent was dictum, and, as the majority concedes, both our summary decision in Suffolk and the plurality opinion in Metromedia sanctioned off-premises restrictions only insofar as they applied to commercial speech. Ante, at 1474. That is, the Court did not need to decide—and did not decide—whether the off-premises  prohibition was content based because restrictions on commercial speech are subject to intermediate scrutiny in any event. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,135,"The majority also claims that finding Austin's sign code to be content based would render the majority opinion in Reed irreconcilable with Justice ALITO's Reed concurrence. Ante, at 1475, n. 6. In particular, Justice ALITO identified nine different types of sign regulations that he believed would not be content based, including rules distinguishing between on-premises and off-premises signs and rules imposing time restrictions on signs advertising a one-time event. 576 U.S. at 174-175, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The majority evidently believes that these two types of sign regulations necessarily turn on a sign's communicative content, like the off-premises sign restriction at issue here.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,136,"That reading of the Reed concurrence makes little sense. First, there is no reason to interpret the concurrence as referring to off-premises or one-time-event rules that turn on a sign's communicative content. Doing so would make those two rules categorically different from the other seven, none of which would ever turn on message content. See, e.g., id., at 174, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (Rules distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs). And although off-premises and one-time-event rules could be drafted in terms of a sign's communicative content, as is true here, they need not be. There might be many formulations of an on/off-premises distinction that are content-neutral. Thomas v. Bright, 937 F.3d 721, 733 (CA6 2019), see also ante, at 1480, n. 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that in ordinary usage an off-premises sign is one that is not attached to or located in close proximity to a building). For instance, a city could define `an on-premises sign as any sign within 500 feet of a building,' 937 F.3d at 732, or a sign that is installed by `a business  licensed to occupy  the premises where the sign is located,' Brief for Summus Outdoor as Amicus Curiae 10. As for regulations of one-time-event signs, Austin itself amended its sign code, at the behest of its lawyers, specifically to make its ordinance content neutral. See Austin, Tex., City Code § 25-10-102(D) (2021), App. 152. Thus, interpreting Justice ALITO's concurrence as referring to rules that turn on communicative content, as opposed to rules that are content neutral, is unwarranted.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,137,"Second, it would be strange to interpret the concurrence as proclaiming that all off-premises sign restrictions are content neutral considering the longstanding dispute over that question. In fact, 20 years before Reed, then-Judge Alito opined that there was no easy answer to the question whether exceptions for `for sale' signs and signs relating to on-site activities would render a sign code content based. Rappa v. New Castle County, 18 F.3d 1043, 1080 (CA3 1994) (concurring opinion), see also, e.g., Ackerley Communications of Mass., Inc. v. Cambridge, 88 F.3d 33, 36, n. 7 (CA1 1996) (In `commonsense' terms, the distinction surely is content-based because determining whether a sign must stay up or must come down requires consideration of the message it carries), Norton Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. Arlington Heights, 69 Ohio St.2d 539, 541, 433 N.E.2d 198, 200 (1982) (In prohibiting all forms of offsite billboard advertising, the ordinance is thus inescapably directed to the content of protected speech). Ultimately, it seems quite unlikely that Justice ALITO's quick recital of some content-neutral rules purported to pre-emptively decide an issue that had long perplexed federal and state courts.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,139,"Near the end of its analysis, the majority invokes an allegedly unbroken tradition of on-/off-premises distinctions that it claims counsels against faithful application of Reed. Ante, at 1475. To be sure, history and tradition are relevant to identifying and defining those few limited areas where, from 1791 to the present, the First Amendment has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech. Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U.S. 786, 791, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), see supra, at 1482, n. 1. But the majority openly admits that off-premises regulations were not present at the founding. Ante, at 1474. And while it asserts that large outdoor advertisements proliferated in the 1800s, ibid., it offers no evidence of any content-based restrictions from that period, let alone off-premises restrictions on noncommercial speech. The earliest example of an off-premises restriction that the majority cites arose in Packer Corp. v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 52 S.Ct. 273, 76 L.Ed. 643 (1932), but that case involved a restriction on commercial advertising and did not even feature a First Amendment claim. See id., at 108-112, 52 S.Ct. 273.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,140,"Ultimately, the majority's only historical support is that regulations like Austin's proliferated following the enactment of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965. Ante, at 1469. The majority's suggestion that the First Amendment should yield to a speech restriction that proliferated —under pressure from the Federal Government—some two centuries after the founding is both startling and dangerous. United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 470, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). This Court has never hinted that the government can, with a few decades of regulation, subject new categories of speech to less exacting First Amendment scrutiny. Id., at 472, 130 S.Ct. 1577.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,141,"Regardless, even if this allegedly unbroken tradition did not fall short by a century or two, the majority offers no explanation why historical regulation is relevant to the question whether the off-premises restriction is content based under Reed and our modern content-neutrality jurisprudence. If Austin had met its burden of identifying a historical tradition of analogous regulation—as can be done, say, for obscenity or defamation—that would not make the off-premises rule content neutral. It might simply mean that the off-premises rule is a constitutional form of content-based discrimination. But content neutrality under Reed is an empirical question, not a historical one. Thus, the majority's historical argument is not only meritless but misguided.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,143,"Despite asserting that the Court of Appeals' analysis under Reed would contravene numerous precedents, ante, at 1474, the majority identifies no decision of this Court supporting the idea that a speech restriction is not content based so long as it regulates a sufficiently broad or non-substantive category of communicative content. In fact, there is only one case that could possibly validate the majority's aberrant analysis: Hill v. Colorado. That Hill is the majority's only support underscores the danger that today's decision poses to the First Amendment.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,144,"Hill involved a law that prohibited persons outside abortion clinics from knowingly approaching within eight feet of another person without consent for the purpose of engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling. 530 U.S. at 707, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (internal quotation marks omitted). Hill concluded, implausibly, that this regulation was content neutral.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,145,"The majority's reasoning in this case is just as implausible. The majority asserts that the off-premises rule is not content based because it does not target a sufficiently specific or substantive category of communications. Ante, at 1472. Hill correspondingly held that restrictions on protest, education, or counseling were not content-based classifications because they cover an extremely broad category of communications. 530 U.S. at 723, 120 S.Ct. 2480. The majority also tries to disguise its redefinition of content neutrality by characterizing Austin's rule as a neutral, location-based restriction. Ante, at 1471. So too did Hill try to conceal its doctrinal innovation by characterizing the buffer-zone law as a neutral place restriction. 530 U.S. at 723, 120 S.Ct. 2480. Finally, the majority finds it immaterial that Austin's rule can be enforced only by reading a sign to determine whether it contains an off-premises message. Ante, at 1472. Hill likewise found it irrelevant that the content of the oral statements would need to be examined to determine whether the prohibition applied. 530 U.S. at 720, 120 S.Ct. 2480.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,146,"The parallel between the majority's opinion and Hill should be discomforting given that Hill represented an unprecedented departure from this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Id., at 772, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Its content-neutrality analysis was, as Justice SCALIA explained, absurd given that the buffer-zone law was obviously and undeniably content based. Id., at 742-743, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (dissenting opinion). First Amendment scholars from across the ideological spectrum agree. See, e.g., M. McConnell, Professor Michael W. McConnell's Response, in K. Sullivan, Sex, Money, and Groups: Free Speech and Association Decisions in the October 1999 Term, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 723, 748 (2001) (The Court said that this statute is content-neutral. I just literally cannot see how they could possibly come to that conclusion), Colloquium, id., at 750, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (Laurence Tribe stating Hill was slam-dunk simple and slam-dunk wrong), R. Fallon, Strict Judicial Scrutiny, 54 UCLA L. Rev. 1267, 1298, and n. 174 (2007) (Hill unconvincingly  maintained that a content-based restriction on speech was not really content-based). And, since Hill, this Court has all but interred its flawed content-neutrality analysis in both McCullen, see supra, at 1486-1487, and Reed. See Price v. Chicago, 915 F.3d 1107, 1118 (CA7 2019) (In the wake of McCullen and Reed, it's not too strong to say that what Hill explicitly rejected is now prevailing law).",Thomas,0,
2021-017,147,"The majority's refusal to acknowledge Hill simply underscores the decision's defunct status. Again, Hill is the only case that could support the majority's ill-conceived content-neutrality analysis, and yet the majority disclaims reliance on it. Lower courts should take the majority's disclaimer at face value: Hill is a decision that we do not cite. Ante, at 1475. And today's decision amounts to little more than an ad hoc exemption for the location-based and supposedly content-agnostic on-/off-premises distinction. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,148,"Even so, the majority's approach should offer little comfort because arbitrary carveouts from Reed undermine the clear and firm rule governing content neutrality that we understood to be an essential means of protecting the freedom of speech. 576 U.S. at 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The majority's deviation from that clear and firm rule poses two serious threats to the First Amendment's protections.",Thomas,0,
2021-017,149,"First, transforming Reed's clear definition of content based regulation back into an opaque and malleable term of art turns the concept of content neutrality into  a vehicle for the implementation of individual judges' policy preferences.

See 530 U.S. at 742, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (I have no doubt that this regulation would be deemed content based in an instant if the case before us involved antiwar protesters, or union members seeking to `educate' the public about the reasons for their strike). The majority's approach in this case is cut from the same cloth. As the majority transparently admits, it seeks to apply our precedents to reach the `commonsense' result and avoid what it perceives as a bizarre result. Ante, at 1475 (emphasis added). But Reed mandates a commonsense test for content neutrality even if the result is that laws that might seem entirely reasonable will sometimes be struck down. 576 U.S. at 163, 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-017,150,"Second, sanctioning certain content-based classifications but not others ignores that even seemingly reasonable content-based restrictions are ready tools for those who would suppress disfavored speech.

This is because the responsibility for distinguishing between permissible and impermissible content carries with it the potential for invidious discrimination of disfavored subjects. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 423-424, n. 19, 113 S.Ct. 1505, 123 L.Ed.2d 99 (1993).

2021-017,151,"The content-based distinction drawn by Austin's off-premises speech restriction is by no means clear, ibid., and plainly lends itself to suppressing disfavored speech, Reed, 576 U.S. at 167, 135 S.Ct. 2218. As the Court of Appeals noted, Austin's prepared counsel struggled to answer whether signs conveying messages like `God Loves You,' `Vote for Kathy,' or `Sally makes quilts here and sells them at 3200 Main Street' would be regulated as off-premises signs. 972 F.3d at 706. Before us, Austin's counsel had similar difficulties, and amici have proposed dozens of religious and political messages that would be next to impossible to categorize under Austin's rule. See, e.g., Brief for Alliance Defending Freedom et. al. as Amici Curiae 15-19, Brief for Institute for Justice as Amicus Curiae 3-9. These pervasive ambiguities offer enforcement officials ample opportunity to suppress disfavored views.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) referred Arteaga-Martinez to an asylum officer, who found that Arteaga-Martinez's testimony was credible and that he had established a reasonable fear of persecution or torture. As a result, DHS referred Arteaga-Martinez's claims for adjudication by an immigration judge in what we have called withholding-only proceedings. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2283.

District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. His petition challenged his continued detention without a bond hearing on both statutory and constitutional grounds. Shortly thereafter, in a separate case, the Third Circuit held that a noncitizen facing prolonged detention under § 1231(a)(6) is entitled by statute to a bond hearing before an immigration judge and must be released from detention unless the Government establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the noncitizen poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community.

This Court has held that § 1231(a) applies to individuals with pending withholding-only proceedings. See Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S., at ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2283-2284.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,38,"After the entry of a final order of removal against a noncitizen, the Government generally must secure the noncitizen's removal during a 90-day `removal period.' § 1231(a)(1)(A). The statute provides that the Government shall detain noncitizens during the statutory removal period. § 1231(a)(2). After the removal period expires, the Government may detain only four categories of people: (1) those who are inadmissible on certain specified grounds, (2) those who are removable on certain specified grounds, (3) those it determines to be a risk to the community, and (4) those it determines to be unlikely to comply with the order of removal. § 1231(a)(6).

2021-018,39,"Section 1231(a)(6) does not expressly specify how long detention past the 90-day removal period may continue for those who fall within the four designated statutory categories. In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), the Court observed that the statute's use of the term may introduces some ambiguity and does not necessarily suggest unlimited discretion. Id., at 697, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The Court explained that a statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem, noting that it had upheld noncriminal detention as consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment only under certain narrow circumstances. Id., at 690, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Accordingly, the Court applied the canon of constitutional avoidance and determined that read in light of the Constitution's demands, § 1231(a)(6) does not permit indefinite detention but instead limits an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States. Id., at 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491.",Sotomayor,0,

One such provision was § 1226(a), which governs the detention of certain noncitizens present in the country who were inadmissible at the time of entry or who have been convicted of certain criminal offenses since they were admitted. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct, at 837-838. Section 1226(a) provides that the attorney general may detain these noncitizens pending their removal proceedings and may release such individuals on bond  or conditional parole. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a)(1), (2). Noncitizens detained under § 1226(a) receive bond hearings after the Government initially detains them. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1) (2021). Relying on Zadvydas, the Ninth Circuit had interpreted § 1226(a) to require additional, periodic bond hearings every six months, with the burden on the Government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that further detention was justified. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 847-848. The Court in Jennings disagreed. It held that the meaning of the  relevant statutory provision is clear and that it did not support a periodic bond hearing requirement. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 848.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,41,"The Jennings Court also rejected the lower court's application of the canon of constitutional avoidance. Earlier in its opinion, the Court explained that the canon of constitutional avoidance `comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.' Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 842 (quoting Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 385, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005)). In the absence of more than one plausible construction, the canon simply has no application. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 842 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this reasoning to § 1226(a), the Court concluded that the canon was inapposite because nothing in § 1226(a)'s text  even remotely supports the imposition of either of the requirements the Ninth Circuit had imposed. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 847.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,43,"The question presented is whether § 1231(a)(6) requires bond hearings before immigration judges after six months of detention in which the Government bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that a noncitizen poses a flight risk or a danger to the community. Section 1231(a)(6) provides that certain noncitizens who have been ordered removed may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to certain terms of supervision. This text, which does not address or even hint at the requirements imposed below, directs that we answer this question in the negative. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 843.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,44,"The Jennings Court emphasized that the canon of constitutional avoidance is only applicable where a statute has more than one plausible construction. Id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 842. Here, there is no plausible construction of the text of § 1231(a)(6) that requires the Government to provide bond hearings before immigration judges after six months of detention, with the Government bearing the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that a detained noncitizen poses a flight risk or a danger to the community. Section 1231(a)(6) provides only that a noncitizen ordered removed may be detained beyond the removal period and if released, shall be subject to certain terms of supervision. On its face, the statute says nothing about bond hearings before immigration judges or burdens of proof, nor does it provide any other indication that such procedures are required. Faithfully applying our precedent, the Court can no more discern such requirements from the text of § 1231(a)(6) than a periodic bond hearing requirement from the text of § 1226(a). See id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 847-848. Section 1231(a)(6) therefore cannot be read to incorporate the procedures imposed by the courts below as a matter of textual command.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,45,"Arteaga-Martinez responds that § 1231(a)(6)'s references to flight risk, dangerousness, and `terms of supervision' support the relief ordered below. Brief for Respondent 29-30. Similarly, respondents in the companion case analogize the text of § 1231(a)(6) to that of § 1226(a), and they note that noncitizens detained under § 1226(a) have long received bond hearings at the outset of detention. Brief for Respondents in Garland v. Gonzalez, O. T. 2021, No. 20-322, pp. 22-24. However, assuming without deciding that an express statutory reference to bond (as in § 1226(a)) might be read to require an initial bond hearing, § 1231(a)(6) contains no such reference. A  more oblique reference to terms of supervision does not suffice.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,46,"Respondents in the companion case also emphasize that regulations offer custody hearings before immigration judges for noncitizens the Government detains under § 1231(a)(6) because it deems them specially dangerous. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.14, Brief for Respondents in No. 20-322, at 16, 25-26. They argue that if the statute can allow custody hearings for these individuals, it requires such hearings for those in Arteaga-Martinez's situation as well. Federal agencies, however, are free to grant additional procedural rights in the exercise of their discretion. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 524, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978). Reviewing courts, on the other hand, are generally not free to impose them if the agencies have not chosen to grant them. Ibid. The parties do not dispute that the Government possesses discretion to provide bond hearings under § 1231(a)(6), see Brief for Petitioners 15, but this Court cannot say, consistent with Jennings, that the statutory text requires them.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,47,"Finally, Arteaga-Martinez argues that Zadvydas, which identified ambiguity in § 1231(a)(6)'s permissive language, supports a view that § 1231(a)(6) implicitly incorporates the specific bond hearing requirements and procedures enumerated by the Court of Appeals. In Jennings, however, this Court faulted the Ninth Circuit for going significantly further than Zadvydas. 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 843-844. Jennings did not overrule or abrogate Zadvydas. But the detailed procedural requirements imposed by the Court of Appeals below reach substantially beyond the limitation on detention authority recognized in Zadvydas. Zadvydas does not require, and Jennings does not permit, the Third Circuit's application of the canon of constitutional avoidance.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-018,49,"Separately from his statutory claims, Arteaga-Martinez contends that reading § 1231(a)(6) not to require bond hearings when detention becomes prolonged raises serious due process concerns. Brief for Respondent 24. He points out that outside of the national-security context, this Court has never authorized prolonged detention without an individualized hearing, before a neutral adjudicator, at which the detainee has a meaningful opportunity to participate. Ibid. (collecting cases). He asserts that the Government's interest in denying bond hearings is minimal because such hearings do not require release. Id., at 26 (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 696, 121 S.Ct. 2491). And he argues that his status as an individual with a reinstated removal order `bears no relation to his dangerousness,' as evidenced by the fact that an Immigration Judge authorized his release on bond. Brief for Respondent 26-27 (quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 692, 121 S.Ct. 2491). The Government responds that regulations directing ICE officials to conduct administrative custody reviews for individuals in ICE detention provide adequate process, at least as a general matter. Brief for Petitioners 18-19. The Government contends that these regulations—which generally require a custody review at the end of the 90-day removal period, a second review by a panel at ICE headquarters after six months of detention, and subsequent annual reviews—provide constitutionally sufficient  substantive and procedural protections for noncitizens whose detention is prolonged. Id., at 18. The Government also notes that as-applied constitutional challenges remain available to address exceptional cases. Id., at 21.",Sotomayor,0,

2021-018,57,"First, we lack jurisdiction to hear this case. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), a federal court has jurisdiction to review questions of law and fact  arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien  only in two circumstances: (1) when the court reviews a final order of removal, or (2) when § 1252 otherwise grants jurisdiction. See, e.g., Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2271, 2292, 210 L.Ed.2d 656 (2021) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 836-838, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018) (same). This jurisdictional zipper clause covers all claims related to removal proceedings, including detention-related withholding-of-removal claims. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2292 (internal quotation marks omitted), see also Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 834-839.",Thomas,0,
2021-018,58,"Because Arteaga-Martinez does not seek review of a final removal order or otherwise invoke § 1252, and because his claim arises from his removal proceedings, I would vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Nonetheless, because the Court has held that we have jurisdiction in cases like these, and the Court's opinion is otherwise correct, I join it in full. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2292 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-018,60,"Second, as I have explained elsewhere, there is considerable historical evidence that the Due Process Clause does not apply to laws governing the removal of  aliens. Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1204, 1245, 200 L.Ed.2d 549 (2018) (dissenting opinion). But even assuming the Due Process Clause extends to some aliens contesting their removability, it does not protect from detention an alien who, like Arteaga-Martinez, does not challenge his final removal order. Illegal aliens deemed removable have no right of release into this country. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 703, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Although the Court properly declines to decide Arteaga-Martinez's due process claim, see ante, at 1834-1835, we should revisit whether the Due Process Clause applies at all in this context.",Thomas,0,
2021-018,62,"Third, this case illustrates why we should overrule Zadvydas at the earliest opportunity. There, the Court held that § 1231(a)(6) would raise a serious constitutional problem under the Fifth Amendment if it permitted indefinite detention of an alien. Id., at 690, 121 S.Ct. 2491. To avoid that supposed problem, the Court deemed ambiguous the statutory authorization that a removable alien may be detained beyond the removal period, and then, clothed in constitutional garb, invoked that manufactured ambiguity to graft a made-up rule onto § 1231(a)(6). Id., at 697, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Namely, the Court decided that immigration authorities can detain an alien only long enough to accomplish the basic purpose of effectuating an alien's removal and must release him once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable. Id., at 697, 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The presumptively reasonable detention period, the Court declared, was six months. Id., at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The Court offered no textual support for that (or any) length of time. See ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-018,63,"As we later implied in Jennings, the constitutional-avoidance canon cannot justify adoption of such an implausible construction of § 1231(a)(6). See 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 841-842. And, until we overrule Zadvydas, it will continue to invite nothing but mischief. An ill-defined, quasi-constitutional command of reasonableness inevitably encourages courts to fashion procedural rules with no basis in statutory text. We confronted that mischief in Jennings, see 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 842-843 (reversing the Ninth Circuit for all but ignoring the statutory text and instead reading Zadvydas  as essentially granting a license to graft a time limit onto the text of § 1225(b)), and we do so again today, compare ante, at 1834, with Guerrero-Sanchez v. Warden York County Prison, 905 F.3d 208, 223 (CA3 2018). We will be forced to engage in this jurisprudential whack-a-mole until we recognize that Zadvydas was wrong the day it was decided and thus does not warrant stare decisis effect. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 401, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), see also Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1960, 1989, 204 L.Ed.2d 322 (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (We should not invoke stare decisis to uphold precedents that are demonstrably erroneous).* * *",Thomas,0,

Because a statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem, we held that the statute, read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States. It does not permit indefinite detention. Id., at 689-690, 121 S.Ct. 2491, see also id., at 690-696, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (explaining potential constitutional concerns presented by indefinite detention under § 1231(a)(6)).",Breyer,0,
2021-018,69,"We also held that the period reasonably necessary to effect removal was presumptively six months. Id., at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491. We recognized that period for the sake of uniform administration in the federal courts. Ibid. But after this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. And for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior postremoval confinement grows, what counts as the `reasonably foreseeable future' conversely would have to shrink. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-018,70,"In my view, Zadvydas controls the outcome here. The statutory language is identical, which is not surprising, for this case concerns the same statutory provision. There are two conceivable differences between this case and Zadvydas, but both argue in favor of applying Zadvydas' holding here.",Breyer,0,
2021-018,71,"First, the respondent here, Antonio Arteaga-Martinez, has been ordered removed, and is therefore subject to § 1231(a), for a different reason than the persons whose cases we considered in Zadvydas. Kestutis Zadvydas and Kim Ho Ma were ordered removed because they had been convicted of serious crimes. Id., at 684-685, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Zadvydas had committed drug crimes, attempted robbery, attempted burglary, and theft, Ma was involved in a gang-related shooting and convicted of manslaughter. Ibid. Arteaga-Martinez's only crime (besides minor traffic violations) is entering the United States without inspection. Ante, at 1830-1831. The Government seeks to detain him while an immigration judge considers his claim that he will be persecuted or tortured if he is returned to Mexico. Ante, at 1830-1831. There is less reason, not more, to detain Arteaga-Martinez without bail.",Breyer,0,
2021-018,72,"Second, Zadvydas provided for outright release, 533 U.S. at 699-700, 121 S.Ct. 2491, this case involves a bail hearing. Again, the Government has less reason to detain a person when the alternative is a bail hearing (where the Government has an opportunity to show that that person might pose a danger to the community or a flight risk) than when the alternative is simply release.",Breyer,0,
2021-018,73,"The Government argues that a later case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018), dictates the result here, rather than Zadvydas. Not at all. That later case involved detention under statutes other than  the one at issue here and in Zadvydas. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 838 (The primary issue is the proper interpretation of §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c)). The Court in Jennings did not modify or overrule Zadvydas, but rather explicitly distinguished that case. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 844-845. It did so on multiple grounds, including the fact that almost all of the statutes at issue in Jennings used words that mandated detention, such as shall, rather than words of discretion, such as may. Id., at ___, ___, 138 S.Ct., at 844, 845. In Zadvydas, the word may created ambiguity that permitted the Court to interpret § 1231(a)(6) (the statute before us) in a manner that avoided the constitutional problem that indefinite detention could have created. 533 U.S. at 697, 121 S.Ct. 2491. The majority in Jennings held that the statutory provisions at issue there were not similarly ambiguous, and therefore did not permit the Court to reach a similar interpretation. 583 U.

2021-018,74,"It is true that one of the statutes interpreted in Jennings, § 1226(a), said that the Attorney General may  arrest and detain an alien pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed, or may release the alien on  bond  or conditional parole. Why did this statute not give the Court the textual leeway needed to permit a bail hearing (given the constitutional problem posed by potentially indefinite detention)? Here is the Court's answer to that question in its entirety:",Breyer,0,
2021-018,75,"The Court of Appeals ordered the Government to provide procedural protections that go well beyond the initial bond hearing established by existing regulations —namely, periodic bond hearings every six months in which the Attorney General must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the alien's continued detention is necessary. Nothing in § 1226(a)'s text—which says only that the Attorney General `may release' the alien `on  bond'—even remotely supports the imposition of either of those requirements. Nor does § 1226(a)'s text even hint that the length of detention prior to a bond hearing must specifically be considered in determining whether the alien should be released. Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 847-848 (emphasis added).",Breyer,0,
2021-018,76,"The court below did not order periodic bond hearings, but it did require the Government to satisfy a clear and convincing evidence standard. Ante, at 1831. I agree that Jennings forecloses this latter requirement. Otherwise, I would find the lower courts' bail hearing requirements reasonable implementations of the Zadvydas standard, which is applicable here.",Breyer,0,
2021-018,77,"Since the Court remands this case for further proceedings, I would add that, in my view, Zadvydas applies (the Court does not hold to the contrary), and the parties are free to argue about the proper way to implement Zadvydas' standard in this context, and, if necessary, to consider the underlying constitutional question, a matter that this Court has not decided.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,42,"Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views. Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman's right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality. Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be imposed.",Alito,0,
2021-019,43,"For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147. Even though the Constitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized such a right, and its survey of history ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common law). After cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a legislature.",Alito,0,
2021-019,44,"Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve viability, i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting potential life,1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-viability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe's reasoning. One prominent constitutional scholar wrote that he would vote for a statute very much like the one the Court ended up drafting if he were a legislator, but his assessment of Roe was memorable and brutal: Roe was not constitutional law at all and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.2",Alito,0,
2021-019,45,"At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent, the decision represented the exercise of raw judicial power, 410 U.S. 179, 222, 93 S.Ct. 762, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and it sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century.4",Alito,0,
2021-019,46,"Eventually, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the Court revisited Roe, but the Members of the Court split three ways. Two Justices expressed no desire to change Roe in any way.5 Four others wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6 And the three remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position.7 Their opinion did not endorse Roe's reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more of its authors might have reservations about whether the Constitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roe's central holding—that a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before viability —even if that holding was wrong.9 Anything less, the opinion claimed, would undermine respect for this Court and the rule of law.",Alito,0,
2021-019,47,"Paradoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions were overruled in toto, and Roe itself was overruled in part.10 Casey threw out Roe's trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion.11 The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. But the three Justices who authored the controlling opinion called the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by treating the Court's decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.12",Alito,0,
2021-019,48,"As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions.",Alito,0,
2021-019,49,"Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy—several weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as viable outside the womb. In defending this law, the State's primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to reaffirm Roe and Casey, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do so. Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, they argue, would be no different than overruling Casey and Roe entirely. Brief for Respondents 43. They contend that no half-measures are available and that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50.",Alito,0,
2021-019,50,"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Alito,0,
2021-019,51,"The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion  a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty. Roe's defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called fetal life and what the law now before us describes as an unborn human being.13",Alito,0,
2021-019,52,"Stare decisis, the doctrine on which Casey's controlling opinion was based, does not compel unending adherence to Roe's abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.",Alito,0,
2021-019,53,"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. Casey, 505 U.S. at 979, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand.",Alito,0,
2021-019,55,"The law at issue in this case, Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, see Miss. Code Ann. § 41-41-191 (2018), contains this central provision: Except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform  or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks. § 4(b).14",Alito,0,
2021-019,56,"To support this Act, the legislature made a series of factual findings. It began by noting that, at the time of enactment, only six countries besides the United States permitted nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after the twentieth week of gestation.15 § 2(a). The legislature then found that at 5 or 6 weeks' gestational age an unborn human being's heart begins beating, at 8 weeks the unborn human being begins to move about in the womb, at 9 weeks all basic physiological functions are present, at 10 weeks vital organs begin to function, and hair, fingernails, and toenails  begin  to form, at 11 weeks an unborn human being's diaphragm is developing, and he or she may move about freely in the womb, and at 12 weeks the unborn human being has taken on `the human form' in all relevant respects. § 2(b)(i) (quoting Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 160, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007)). It found that most abortions after 15 weeks employ dilation and evacuation procedures which involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child, and it concluded that the intentional commitment of such acts for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. § 2(b)(i)(8).",Alito,0,
2021-019,57,"Respondents are an abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, and one of its doctors. On the day the Gestational Age Act was enacted, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court against various Mississippi officials, alleging that the Act violated this Court's precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions and that 15 weeks' gestational age is prior to viability.

Petitioners' primary defense of the Mississippi Gestational Age Act is that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review.

They tell us that no half-measures are available: We must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50.",Alito,0,
2021-019,60,"We begin by considering the critical question whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Skipping over that question, the controlling opinion in Casey reaffirmed Roe's central holding based solely on the doctrine of stare decisis, but as we will explain, proper application of stare decisis required an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. See infra, at 2265-2266.",Alito,0,
2021-019,61,"We therefore turn to the question that the Casey plurality did not consider, and we address that question in three steps. First, we explain the standard that our cases have used in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendment's reference to liberty protects a particular right. Second, we examine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted in our Nation's history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of what we have described as ordered liberty. Finally, we consider whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents.",Alito,0,
2021-019,64,"Constitutional analysis must begin with the language of the instrument, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 186-189, 6  L.Ed. 23 (1824), which offers a fixed standard for ascertaining what our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 399, p. 383 (1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right must show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text.",Alito,0,
2021-019,65,"Roe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of the constitutional text. It held that the abortion right, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right to privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U.S. at 152-153, 93 S.Ct. 705. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been found to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisions —the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152, 93 S.Ct. 705.",Alito,0,
2021-019,66,"The Court's discussion left open at least three ways in which some combination of these provisions could protect the abortion right. One possibility was that the right was founded  in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people. Id., at 153, 93 S.Ct. 705. Another was that the right was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of those provisions, and that this right had been incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of Rights provisions had by then been incorporated. Ibid, see also McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 763-766, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third path was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments played no role and that the right was simply a component of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Roe, 410 U.S. at 153, 93 S.Ct. 705. Roe expressed the feeling that the Fourteenth Amendment was the provision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the abortion right could be found somewhere in the Constitution and that specifying its exact location was not of paramount importance.16 The Casey Court did not defend this unfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.",Alito,0,
2021-019,67,"We discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional provision that some of respondents' amici have now offered as yet another potential home for the abortion right: the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24 (Brief for United States), see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional Law Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw fit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our precedents, which establish that a State's regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications.17 The regulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened constitutional  scrutiny unless the regulation is a mere pretext designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other. Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496, n. 20, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974). And as the Court has stated, the goal of preventing abortion does not constitute invidiously discriminatory animus against women. Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 273-274, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.18",Alito,0,
2021-019,68,"With this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey's bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 505 U.S. at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791, Brief for Respondents 17, Brief for United States 21-22.",Alito,0,
2021-019,70,"The underlying theory on which this argument rests—that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for liberty—has long been controversial. But our decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights.",Alito,0,
2021-019,71,"The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247-251, 8 L.Ed. 672 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.), but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. See McDonald, 561 U.S. at 763-767, and nn. 12-13, 130 S.Ct. 3020. The second category—which is the one in question here—comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.",Alito,0,
2021-019,72,"In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and whether it is essential to our Nation's scheme of ordered liberty. Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 682, 686, 203 L.Ed.2d 11 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted), McDonald, 561 U.S. at 764, 767, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (internal quotation marks omitted), Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258 (internal quotation marks omitted).19 And in conducting this inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue.",Alito,0,
2021-019,73,"Justice Ginsburg's opinion for the Court in Timbs is a recent example. In concluding that the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive fines is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, 586 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 689 (internal quotation marks omitted), her opinion traced the right back to Magna Carta, Blackstone's Commentaries, and 35 of the 37 state constitutions in effect at the  ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. 586 U.S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 687-690.",Alito,0,
2021-019,74,"A similar inquiry was undertaken in McDonald, which held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. The lead opinion surveyed the origins of the Second Amendment, the debates in Congress about the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state constitutions in effect when that Amendment was ratified (at least 22 of the 37 States protected the right to keep and bear arms), federal laws enacted during the same period, and other relevant historical evidence. 561 U.S. at 767-777, 130 S.Ct. 3020. Only then did the opinion conclude that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty. Id., at 778, 130 S.Ct. 3020, see also id., at 822-850, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (surveying history and reaching the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause).",Alito,0,
2021-019,75,"Timbs and McDonald concerned the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects rights that are expressly set out in the Bill of Rights, and it would be anomalous if similar historical support were not required when a putative right is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Thus, in Glucksberg, which held that the Due Process Clause does not confer a right to assisted suicide, the Court surveyed more than 700 years of Anglo-American common law tradition, 521 U.S., at 711, 117 S.Ct. 2258, and made clear that a fundamental right must be objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, id., at 720-721, 117 S.Ct. 2258.",Alito,0,
2021-019,76,"Historical inquiries of this nature are essential whenever we are asked to recognize a new component of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause because the term liberty alone provides little guidance. Liberty is a capacious term. As Lincoln once said: We all declare for Liberty, but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.20 In a well-known essay, Isaiah Berlin reported that historians of ideas had cataloged more than 200 different senses in which the term had been used.21",Alito,0,
2021-019,77,"In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendment's reference to liberty, we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. That is why the Court has long been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992). Substantive due process has at times been a treacherous field for this Court, Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has sometimes led the Court to usurp authority that the Constitution entrusts to the people's elected representatives. See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225-226, 106 S.Ct. 507, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). As the Court cautioned in Glucksberg, we must  exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences  of the Members of this Court. 521 U.S., at 720, 117 S.Ct. 2258 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).",Alito,0,
2021-019,78,"On occasion, when the Court has ignored the appropriate limits imposed by `respect for the teachings of history,' Moore, 431 U.S. at 503, 97 S.Ct. 1932 (plurality opinion), it has fallen into the freewheeling judicial policymaking that characterized discredited decisions such as Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905). The Court must not fall prey to such an unprincipled approach. Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation's concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term liberty. When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion.22",Alito,0,
2021-019,81,"Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware. And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before Roe.23",Alito,0,
2021-019,82,"Not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy,  and the remaining States would soon follow.",Alito,0,

2021-019,86,"We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least after quickening—i.e., the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.24",Alito,0,

Kansas, 589 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1021, 1027, 206 L.Ed.2d 312 (2020), all describe abortion after quickening as criminal. Henry de Bracton's 13th-century treatise explained that if a person has struck a pregnant woman, or has given her poison, whereby he has caused abortion, if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated, he commits homicide. 2 De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879), see also 1 Fleta, c. 23, reprinted in 72 Selden Soc. 60-61 (H. Richardson & G. Sayles eds. 1955) (13th-century treatise).25",Alito,0,

(Misprision referred to some heynous offence under the degree of felony. Id., at 139.) Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a great crime and a great misprision. Pleas of the Crown 53 (P. Glazebrook ed. 1972), 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown 433 (1736) (Hale). And writing near the time of the adoption of our Constitution, William Blackstone explained that abortion of a quick child was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter (citing Bracton), and at least a very heinous misdemeanor (citing Coke). 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 129-130 (7th ed. 1775) (Blackstone).",Alito,0,

Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case mentioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with no mention of quickening) that he had never met with a case so barbarous and unnatural.28 Similarly, an indictment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a pre-quickening and post-quickening abortion, described abortion as pernicious and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity. Keown 7 (discussing R. v. Webb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512 (1980)).",Alito,0,
2021-019,91,"That the common law did not condone even prequickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a proto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a way in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the level of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman with child a potion to cause an abortion, and the woman died, it was murder because the potion was given unlawfully to destroy her child within her. 1 Hale 429-430 (emphasis added). As Blackstone explained, to be murder a killing had to be done with malice aforethought, either express or implied. 4 Blackstone 198 (emphasis deleted). In the case of an abortionist, Blackstone wrote, the law will imply malice for the same reason that it would imply malice if a person who intended to kill one person accidentally killed a different person:",Alito,0,
2021-019,92,"If one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is murder, because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case, where one lays poison for A, and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him, this is likewise murder. So also, if one gives a woman with child a medicine to procure abortion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman, this is murder in the person who gave it. Id., at 200-201 (emphasis added, footnote omitted).29",Alito,0,
2021-019,93,"Notably, Blackstone, like Hale, did not state that this proto-felony-murder rule required that the woman be with quick child—only that she be with child. Id., at 201. And it is revealing that Hale and Blackstone treated abortionists differently from other physicians or surgeons who caused the death of a patient without any intent of doing the patient any bodily hurt. Hale 429, see 4 Blackstone 197. These other physicians—even if unlicensed —would not be guilty of murder or manslaughter. Hale 429. But a physician performing an abortion would, precisely because his aim was an unlawful one.",Alito,0,
2021-019,94,"In sum, although common-law authorities differed on the severity of punishment for abortions committed at different points in pregnancy, none endorsed the practice. Moreover, we are aware of no common-law case or authority, and the parties have not pointed to any, that remotely suggests a positive right to procure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy.",Alito,0,
2021-019,96,"In this country, the historical record is similar. The most important early American edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 594, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), reported Blackstone's statement that abortion of a quick child was at least a heinous misdemeanor, 2 St. George Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries 129-130 (1803), and that edition also included Blackstone's discussion of the proto-felony-murder rule, 5 id., at 200-201. Manuals for justices of the peace printed in the Colonies in the 18th century typically restated the common-law rule on abortion, and some manuals repeated Hale's and Blackstone's statements that anyone who prescribed medication unlawfully to destroy the child would be guilty of murder if the woman died. See, e.g., J. Parker, Conductor Generalis 220 (1788), 2 R. Burn, Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 221-222 (7th ed. 1762) (English manual stating the same).30",Alito,0,
2021-019,97,"The few cases available from the early colonial period corroborate that abortion was a crime. See generally Dellapenna 215-228 (collecting cases). In Maryland in 1652, for example, an indictment charged that a man Murtherously endeavoured to destroy or Murther the Child by him begotten in the Womb. Proprietary v. Mitchell, 10 Md. Archives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the 19th century, courts frequently explained that the common law made abortion of a quick child a crime. See, e.g., Smith v. Gaffard, 31 Ala. 45, 51 (1857), Smith v. State, 33 Me. 48, 55 (1851), State v. Cooper, 22 N.J.L. 52, 52-55 (1849), Commonwealth v. Parker, 50 Mass. 263, 264-268 (1845).",Alito,0,
2021-019,99,"The original ground for drawing a distinction between pre- and post-quickening abortions is not entirely clear, but some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that a pre-quickening fetus was alive. At that time, there were no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early stages,31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: Until the period of quickening  there is no evidence of life, and whatever may be said of the feotus, the law has fixed upon this period of gestation as the time when the child is endowed with life because foetal movements are the first clearly marked and well defined evidences of life. Evans v. People, 49 N.Y. 86, 90 (emphasis added), Cooper, 22 N.J.L. at 56 (In contemplation of law life commences at the moment of quickening, at that moment when the embryo gives the first physical proof of life, no matter when it first received it (emphasis added)).",Alito,0,
2021-019,100,"The Solicitor General offers a different explanation of the basis for the quickening rule, namely, that before quickening the common law did not regard a fetus as having a `separate and independent existence.' Brief for United States 26 (quoting Parker, 50 Mass. at 266). But the case on which the Solicitor General relies for this proposition also suggested that the criminal law's quickening rule was out of step with the treatment of prenatal life in other areas of law, noting that to many purposes, in reference to civil rights, an infant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person in being. Ibid. (citing 1 Blackstone 129), see also Evans, 49 N.Y. at 89, Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633 (1850), Morrow v. Scott, 7 Ga. 535, 537 (1849), Hall v.

2021-019,101,"At any rate, the original ground for the quickening rule is of little importance for present purposes because the rule was abandoned in the 19th century. During that period, treatise writers and commentators criticized the quickening distinction as neither in accordance with the result of medical experience, nor with the principles of the common law. F. Wharton, Criminal Law § 1220, p. 606 (rev. 4th ed. 1857) (footnotes omitted), see also J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence 26-28 (2d ed. 1835) (describing the quickening distinction as absurd and injurious).32 In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy and authorized the imposition of severe punishment. See Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58 (1803). One scholar has suggested that Parliament's decision may partly have been attributable to the medical man's concern that fetal life should be protected by the law at all stages of gestation. Keown 22.",Alito,0,
2021-019,102,"In this country during the 19th century, the vast majority of the States enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See Appendix A, infra (listing state statutory provisions in chronological order).33 By 1868, the year when the  Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, three-quarters of the States, 28 out of 37, had enacted statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before quickening.34 See ibid. Of the nine States that had not yet criminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910. See ibid.",Alito,0,
2021-019,103,"The trend in the Territories that would become the last 13 States was similar: All of them criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy between 1850 (the Kingdom of Hawaii) and 1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix B, infra, see also Casey, 505 U.S. at 952, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), Dellapenna 317-319. By the end of the 1950s, according to the Roe Court's own count, statutes in all but four States and the District of Columbia prohibited abortion however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. 410 U.S. at 139, 93 S.Ct. 705.35",Alito,0,
2021-019,104,"This overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Court's own count, a substantial majority—30 States—still prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother. See id., at 118, and n. 2, 93 S.Ct. 705 (listing States). And though Roe discerned a trend toward liberalization in about one-third of the States, those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe would allow. Id., at 140, 93 S.Ct. 705, and n. 37, Tribe 2. In short, the Court's opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 793, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (White, J., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2021-019,106,"The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment  persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973. The Court in Roe could have said of abortion exactly what Glucksberg said of assisted suicide: Attitudes toward abortion have changed since Bracton, but our laws have consistently condemned, and continue to prohibit, that practice. 521 U.S., at 719, 117 S.Ct. 2258.",Alito,0,
2021-019,108,Respondents and their amici have no persuasive answer to this historical evidence.,Alito,0,
2021-019,109,"Neither respondents nor the Solicitor General disputes the fact that by 1868 the vast majority of States criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See Brief for Petitioners 12-13, see also Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 27-28, and nn. 14-15 (conceding that 26 out of 37 States prohibited abortion before quickening), Tr. of Oral Arg. 74-75 (respondents' counsel conceding the same). Instead, respondents are forced to argue that it does not matter that some States prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided or when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Brief for Respondents 21. But that argument flies in the face of the standard we have applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.",Alito,0,
2021-019,110,"Not only are respondents and their amici unable to show that a constitutional right to abortion was established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, but they have found no support for the existence of an abortion right that predates the latter part of the 20th century—no state constitutional provision, no statute, no judicial decision, no learned treatise. The earliest sources called to our attention are a few district court and state court decisions decided shortly before Roe and a small number of law review articles from the same time period.36",Alito,0,
2021-019,111,"A few of respondents' amici muster historical arguments, but they are very weak. The Solicitor General repeats Roe's claim that it is `doubtful'  `abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus.' Brief for United States 26 (quoting Roe, 410 U.S. at 136, 93 S.Ct. 705). But as we have seen, great common-law authorities like Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone all wrote that a post-quickening abortion was a crime—and a serious one at that. Moreover, Hale and Blackstone (and many other authorities following them) asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt.",Alito,0,
2021-019,112,"Instead of following these authorities, Roe relied largely on two articles by a proabortion advocate who claimed that Coke had intentionally misstated the common law because of his strong anti-abortion views.37 These articles have been discredited,38 and it has come to light that even  members of Jane Roe's legal team did not regard them as serious scholarship. An internal memorandum characterized this author's work as donning the guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals.39 Continued reliance on such scholarship is unsupportable.",Alito,0,
2021-019,113,"The Solicitor General next suggests that history supports an abortion right because the common law's failure to criminalize abortion before quickening means that at the Founding and for decades thereafter, women generally could terminate a pregnancy, at least in its early stages.40 Brief for United States 26-27, see also Brief for Respondents 21. But the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills, 13 Pa. at 633, State v. Slagle, 83 N.C. 630, 632 (1880), and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures began to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no one, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they enacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising since common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an unlawful act without regard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See supra, at 2248-2252.",Alito,0,
2021-019,114,"Another amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see Brief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance of the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that they were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to this account, which is based almost entirely on statements made by one prominent proponent of the statutes, important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to shirk their maternal duties. Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 20.",Alito,0,
2021-019,115,"Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any real historical support for the right that Roe and Casey recognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based on alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Pap's A.

California, 283 U.S. 423, 455, 51 S.Ct. 522, 75 L.Ed. 1154 (1931) (collecting cases). The Court has recognized that inquiries into legislative motives are a hazardous matter. O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 383, 88 S.Ct. 1673. Even when an argument about legislative motive is backed by statements made by legislators who voted for a law, we have been reluctant to attribute those motives to the legislative body as a whole. What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Id., at 384, 88 S.Ct. 1673.",Alito,0,
2021-019,116,"Here, the argument about legislative motive is not even based on statements by legislators, but on statements made by a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, and it is quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators whose votes were responsible for the enactment of those laws. Recall that at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States had adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all stages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century until the day Roe was handed down, every single State had such a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds of lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws were motivated by hostility to Catholics and women?",Alito,0,
2021-019,117,"There is ample evidence that the passage of these laws was instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries made that point. See, e.g., Nash v. Meyer, 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P.2d 273, 280 (1934), State v.

2021-019,120,"Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right.

While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they wish about existence, meaning, the universe, and the mystery of human life, they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts. License to act on the basis of such beliefs may correspond to one of the many understandings of liberty, but it is certainly not ordered liberty.",Alito,0,

In some States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be even more extensive than the right that Roe and Casey recognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an unborn human being. Miss. Code Ann. § 41-41-191(4)(b).

Nor does the dissent dispute the fact that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening, that the 19th century saw a  trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening abortions, that by 1868, a supermajority of States (at least 26 of 37) had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy, that by the late 1950s at least 46 States prohibited abortion however and whenever performed except if necessary to save the life of the mother, Roe, 410 U.S. at 139, 93 S.Ct. 705, and that when Roe was decided in 1973 similar statutes were still in effect in 30 States. Compare post, at 2324, nn. 2-3, with supra, at 2252-2254, and nn. 33-34.47",Alito,0,
2021-019,134,"The dissent's failure to engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position. We have held that the established method of substantive-due-process analysis requires that an unenumerated right be `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' before it can be recognized as a component of the liberty protected in the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258, cf. Timbs, 586 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 689-90. But despite the dissent's professed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage with that important precedent—which it cannot possibly satisfy.",Alito,0,
2021-019,135,"The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepresenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests that we have focused only on the legal status of abortion in the 19th century, post, at 2331, but our review of this Nation's tradition extends well past that period. As explained, for more than a century after 1868—including another half-century after women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, see post, at 2324-2325, Amdt. 19—it was firmly established that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today, another half century later, more than half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and Casey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion has ever been part of this Nation's tradition.",Alito,0,
2021-019,137,"Because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, it contends that the constitutional tradition is not captured whole at a single moment, and that its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents. Post, at 2326 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the exercise of raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U.S. at 222, 93 S.Ct. 762 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent claims that its standard does not mean anything goes, post, at 2326, any real restraints are hard to discern.",Alito,0,
2021-019,138,"The largely limitless reach of the dissenters' standard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if the long sweep of history imposes any restraint on the recognition of unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were critically different for a reason that we have explained: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called potential life. See supra, at 2257-2258.",Alito,0,
2021-019,139,"So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe's reasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent's proposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roe's interpretation. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not `an inexorable command.' Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 455, 135 S.Ct. 2401, 192 L.Ed.2d 463 (2015). There are occasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one of them.",Alito,0,
2021-019,141,"The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage). Perhaps this is designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights, but the dissent's analogy is objectionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about the dissent's views on the protection of what Roe called potential life. The exercise of the rights at issue in Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell does not destroy a potential life, but an abortion has that effect. So if the rights at issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the right recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a potential life as a matter of any significance.",Alito,0,
2021-019,142,"That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent has much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women, the burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor women. These are important concerns. However, the dissent evinces no similar regard for a State's interest in protecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the balance, post, at 2317-2318, 2319-2320, 2320-2321, 2322, 2323, that the viability line strikes between a woman's liberty interest and the State's interest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later, see infra, at 2268-2271, 2271-2272, and given in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 2310-2313 (opinion concurring in judgment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not adequately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try to defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the destruction of a fetus.",Alito,0,
2021-019,143,"Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people a particular theory about when the rights of personhood begin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human right—to live—at least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has passed. Nothing in the Constitution or in our Nation's legal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt that `theory of life.' Post, at 2320-2321.",Alito,0,
2021-019,145,"We next consider whether the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role in our case law, and we have explained that it serves many valuable ends. It protects the interests of  those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion), see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991). It reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation. Kimble, 576 U.S. at 455, 135 S.Ct. 2401. It fosters evenhanded decisionmaking by requiring that like cases be decided in a like manner. Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597. It contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. Ibid. And it restrains judicial hubris and reminds us to respect the judgment of those who have grappled with important questions in the past. Precedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges. N. Gorsuch, A Republic, If You Can Keep It 217 (2019).",Alito,0,
2021-019,146,"We have long recognized, however, that stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 233, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). It has been said that it is sometimes more important that an issue `be settled than that it be settled right.' Kimble, 576 U.S. at 455, 135 S.Ct. 2401 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). But when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution—the great charter of our liberties, which was meant to endure through a long lapse of ages, Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326, 14 U.S. 304, 4 L.Ed. 97 (1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.)—we place a high value on having the matter settled right. In addition, when one of our constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An erroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the Constitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to amend. See Art. V, Kimble, 576 U.S. at 456, 135 S.Ct. 2401. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions.",Alito,0,
2021-019,147,"Some of our most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. We mention three. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the Court repudiated the separate but equal doctrine, which had allowed States to maintain racially segregated schools and other facilities. Id., at 488, 74 S.Ct. 686 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so doing, the Court overruled the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), along with six other Supreme Court precedents that had applied the separate-but-equal rule.

C., 261 U.S. 525, 43 S.Ct. 394, 67 L.Ed. 785 (1923), which had held that a law setting minimum wages for women violated the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Id., at 545, 16 S.Ct. 1138. West Coast Hotel signaled the demise of an entire line of important precedents that had protected an individual liberty right against state and federal health and welfare legislation. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905) (holding invalid a law setting maximum working hours), Coppage v.

Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 84 L.Ed. 1375 (1940), and held that public school students could not be compelled to salute the flag in violation of their sincere beliefs. Barnette stands out because nothing had changed during the intervening period other than the Court's belated recognition that its earlier decision had been seriously wrong.",Alito,0,
2021-019,150,"On many other occasions, this Court has overruled important constitutional decisions.

2021-019,151,"No Justice of this Court has ever argued that the Court should never overrule a constitutional decision, but overruling a precedent is a serious matter. It is not a step that should be taken lightly. Our cases have attempted to provide a framework for deciding when a precedent should be overruled, and they have identified factors that should be considered in making such a decision. Janus v.

It was egregiously wrong on the day it was decided, see Ramos, 590 U.S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1414 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.), and as the Solicitor General agreed at oral argument, it should have been overruled at the earliest opportunity, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 92-93.",Alito,0,
2021-019,156,"Roe was also egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. For reasons already explained, Roe's constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed.",Alito,0,
2021-019,157,"Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided, Casey perpetuated its errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of little importance to the American people. Rather, wielding nothing but raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U.S. at 222, 93 S.Ct. 762 (White, J., dissenting), the Court usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people. Casey described itself as calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the State's interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who dissented in any respect from Roe. Roe fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since. Casey, 505 U.S. at 995-996, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Together, Roe and Casey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand.",Alito,0,
2021-019,158,"As the Court's landmark decision in West Coast Hotel illustrates, the Court has previously overruled decisions that wrongly removed an issue from the people and the democratic process. As Justice White later explained, decisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the people's authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For this reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be mistaken. Thornburgh, 476 U.S. at 787, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (dissenting opinion).",Alito,0,
2021-019,160,"The quality of the reasoning. Under our precedents, the quality of the reasoning in a prior case has an important bearing on whether it should be reconsidered.

In Part II, supra, we explained why Roe was incorrectly decided, but that decision was more than just wrong. It stood on exceptionally weak grounds.",Alito,0,
2021-019,161,"Roe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative, it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court, it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the history of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source, and its most important rule (that States cannot protect fetal life prior to viability) was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained. Roe's reasoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from supporters of broad access to abortion.",Alito,0,
2021-019,162,"The Casey plurality, while reaffirming Roe's central holding, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. It revised the textual basis for the abortion right, silently abandoned Roe's erroneous historical narrative, and jettisoned the trimester framework. But it replaced that scheme with an arbitrary undue burden test and relied on an exceptional version of stare decisis that, as explained below, this Court had never before applied and has never invoked since.",Alito,0,
2021-019,165,"The weaknesses in Roe's reasoning are well-known. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U.S. at 163-164, 93 S.Ct. 705. Dividing pregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special rules for each. During the first trimester, the Court announced, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. Id., at 164, 93 S.Ct. 705. After that point, a State's interest in regulating abortion for the sake of a woman's health became compelling, and accordingly, a State could regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. Ibid. Finally, in the stage subsequent to viability, which in 1973 roughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the State's interest in the potentiality of human life became compelling, and therefore a State could regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Id., at 164-165, 93 S.Ct. 705.",Alito,0,
2021-019,166,"This elaborate scheme was the Court's own brainchild. Neither party advocated the trimester framework, nor did either party or any amicus argue that viability should mark the point at which the scope of the abortion right and a State's regulatory authority should be substantially transformed. See Brief for Appellant and Brief for Appellee in Roe v. Wade, O. T. 1972, No. 70-18, see also C. Forsythe, Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe v. Wade, 127, 141 (2012).",Alito,0,
2021-019,168,"Not only did this scheme resemble the work of a legislature, but the Court made little effort to explain how these rules could be deduced from any of the sources  on which constitutional decisions are usually based. We have already discussed Roe's treatment of constitutional text, and the opinion failed to show that history, precedent, or any other cited source supported its scheme.",Alito,0,
2021-019,169,"Roe featured a lengthy survey of history, but much of its discussion was irrelevant, and the Court made no effort to explain why it was included. For example, multiple paragraphs were devoted to an account of the views and practices of ancient civilizations where infanticide was widely accepted. See 410 U.S. at 130-132, 93 S.Ct. 705 (discussing ancient Greek and Roman practices).49 When it came to the most important historical fact—how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted—the Court said almost nothing. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws in the middle and late 19th century, id., at 139, 93 S.Ct. 705, but it implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further a Victorian social concern about illicit sexual conduct, id., at 148, 93 S.Ct. 705.",Alito,0,
2021-019,170,"Roe's failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Relying on two discredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court erroneously suggested —contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone, and a wealth of other authority —that the common law had probably never really treated post-quickening abortion as a crime. See id., at 136, 93 S.Ct. 705 (It now appears doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus). This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Court's thinking because the opinion cited the lenity of the common law as one of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at 165, 93 S.Ct. 705.",Alito,0,
2021-019,171,"After surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee.

Id., at 141, 144, 146, 93 S.Ct. 705 (emphasis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision handed down in 1939 and a new British abortion law enacted in 1967. Id., at 137-138, 93 S.Ct. 705. The Court did not explain why these sources shed light on the meaning of the Constitution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything like the scheme that Roe imposed on the country.",Alito,0,
2021-019,172,"Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional right of personal privacy, id., at 152, 93 S.Ct. 705, but it conflated two very different meanings of the term: the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977). Only the cases involving this second sense of the term could have any possible relevance to the abortion issue,  and some of the cases in that category involved personal decisions that were obviously very, very far afield. See Pierce, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (right to send children to religious school), Meyer, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (right to have children receive German language instruction).",Alito,0,

But none of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed potential life.",Alito,0,
2021-019,174,"When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were consistent with the following: (1) the relative weights of the respective interests involved, (2) the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, (3) the lenity of the common law, and (4) the demands of the profound problems of the present day. Roe, 410 U.S., at 165, 93 S.Ct. 705. Put aside the second and third factors, which were based on the Court's flawed account of history, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body.",Alito,0,
2021-019,176,"What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State have no authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the purpose of protecting a woman's health? The Court's only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id., at 163, 93 S.Ct. 705. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from the normal rule that courts defer to the judgments of legislatures in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties. Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427, 94 S.Ct. 700, 38 L.Ed.2d 618 (1974).",Alito,0,
2021-019,177,An even more glaring deficiency was Roe's failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. Here is the Court's entire explanation:,Alito,0,
2021-019,178,"With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the `compelling' point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life out-side the womb. 410 U.S. at 163, 93 S.Ct. 705.",Alito,0,
2021-019,179,"As Professor Laurence Tribe has written, clearly, this mistakes `a definition for a syllogism.' Tribe 4 (quoting Ely 924). The definition of a viable fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at which the State's interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe held, a State's interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling after viability, 410 U.S. at 163, 93 S.Ct. 705, why isn't that interest equally compelling before viability? Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 519, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quoting Thornburgh, 476 U.S.",Alito,0,
2021-019,180,"at 795, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (White, J., dissenting)). Roe did not say, and no explanation is apparent.",Alito,0,
2021-019,181,"This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not be entitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics that they regard as defining what it means to be a person. Among the characteristics that have been offered as essential attributes of personhood are sentience, self-awareness, the ability to reason, or some combination thereof.50 By this logic, it would be an open question whether even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as persons. But even if one takes the view that personhood begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired, it is very hard to see why viability should mark the point where personhood begins.",Alito,0,
2021-019,182,"The most obvious problem with any such argument is that viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. One is the state of neonatal care at a particular point in time. Due to the development of new equipment and improved practices, the viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th century, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or 33d week of pregnancy or even later.51 When Roe was decided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410 U.S. at 160, 93 S.Ct. 705. Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24 weeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according to Roe's logic, States now have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus with a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States did  not have an interest in protecting an identical fetus. How can that be?",Alito,0,
2021-019,183,"Viability also depends on the quality of the available medical facilities. Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 396, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable if a woman gives birth in a city with hospitals that provide advanced care for very premature babies, but if the woman travels to a remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no longer be viable. On what ground could the constitutional status of a fetus depend on the pregnant woman's location? And if viability is meant to mark a line having universal moral significance, can it be that a fetus that is viable in a big city in the United States has a privileged moral status not enjoyed by an identical fetus in a remote area of a poor country?",Alito,0,
2021-019,184,"In addition, as the Court once explained, viability is not really a hard-and-fast line. Ibid. A physician determining a particular fetus's odds of surviving outside the womb must consider a number of variables, including gestational age, fetal weight, a woman's general health and nutrition, the quality of the available medical facilities, and other factors. Id., at 395-396, 99 S.Ct. 675. It is thus only with difficulty that a physician can estimate the probability of a particular fetus's survival. Id., at 396, 99 S.Ct. 675. And even if each fetus's probability of survival could be ascertained with certainty, settling on a probability of survival that should count as viability is another matter. Ibid. Is a fetus viable with a 10 percent chance of survival? 25 percent? 50 percent? Can such a judgment be made by a State? And can a State specify a gestational age limit that applies in all cases? Or must these difficult questions be left entirely to the individual attending physician on the particular facts of the case before him? Id., at 388, 99 S.Ct. 675.",Alito,0,
2021-019,185,"The viability line, which Casey termed Roe's central rule, makes no sense, and it is telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew such a line.52 The Court thus asserted raw judicial power to impose, as a matter of constitutional law, a uniform viability rule that allowed the States less freedom to regulate abortion than the majority of western democracies enjoy.",Alito,0,
2021-019,187,"All in all, Roe's reasoning was exceedingly weak, and academic commentators, including those who agreed with the decision as a matter of policy, were unsparing in their criticism. John Hart Ely famously wrote that Roe was not constitutional law and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be. Ely 947 (emphasis deleted). Archibald Cox, who served as Solicitor General under President Kennedy, commented that Roe reads like a set of hospital rules and regulations that neither historian, layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded  are part of  the Constitution. The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government 113-114 (1976). Laurence Tribe wrote that even if there is a need to divide pregnancy into several segments with lines that clearly identify the limits of governmental power, `interest-balancing' of the form the Court pursues fails to justify any of the lines actually drawn. Tribe 4-5. Mark Tushnet termed Roe a totally unreasoned judicial opinion. Red, White, and Blue: A Critical Analysis of Constitutional Law 54 (1988). See also P.

Thornburgh, 476 U.S. at 794, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (dissenting opinion). And the United States as amicus curiae asked the Court to overrule Roe five times in the decade before Casey, see 505 U.S. at 844, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion), and then asked the Court to overrule it once more in Casey itself.",Alito,0,
2021-019,191,"When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, very little of Roe's reasoning was defended or preserved. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. 505 U.S. at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. The Court did not reaffirm Roe's erroneous account of abortion history. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said anything about the history of the abortion right. And as for precedent, the Court relied on essentially the same body of cases that Roe had cited. Thus, with respect to the standard grounds for constitutional decisionmaking—text, history, and precedent—Casey did not attempt to bolster Roe's reasoning.",Alito,0,
2021-019,192,"The Court also made no real effort to remedy one of the greatest weaknesses in Roe's analysis: its much-criticized discussion of viability. The Court retained what it called Roe's central holding—that a State may not regulate pre-viability abortions for the purpose of protecting fetal life—but it provided no principled defense of the viability line. 505 U.S. at 860, 870-871, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Instead, it merely rephrased what Roe had said, stating that viability marked the point at which the independent existence of a second life can in reason and fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. 505 U.S. at 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Why reason and fairness demanded that the line be drawn at viability the Court did not explain. And the Justices who authored the controlling opinion conspicuously failed to say that they agreed with the viability rule, instead, they candidly acknowledged the reservations some of us may have in reaffirming that holding of Roe. Id., at 853, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Alito,0,
2021-019,193,"The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roe's trimester scheme, 505 U.S. at 872, 112 S.Ct. 2791, and substituted a new undue burden test, but the basis for this test was obscure. And as we will explain, the test is full of ambiguities and is difficult to apply.",Alito,0,
2021-019,194,"Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe's analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe's reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe's central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe's status as precedent, and imposed a new and problematic test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent.",Alito,0,
2021-019,195,"As discussed below, Casey also deployed a novel version of the doctrine of stare decisis. See infra, at 2276-2279. This new doctrine did not account for the profound wrongness of the decision in Roe, and placed great weight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis in prior case law. Stare decisis does not command the preservation of such a decision.",Alito,0,
2021-019,197,"Workability. Our precedents counsel that another important consideration in deciding whether a precedent should be overruled is whether the rule it imposes is workable—that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner.

Casey's undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale.",Alito,0,
2021-019,199,"Problems begin with the very concept of an undue burden. As Justice Scalia noted in his Casey partial dissent, determining whether a burden is due or undue is inherently standardless. 505 U.S. at 992, 112 S.Ct. 2791, see also June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2103, 2180, 207 L.Ed.2d 566 (2020) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (Whether a burden is deemed undue depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and how much weight he accords each of them (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).",Alito,0,
2021-019,200,"The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the undue burden test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. The first rule is that a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. 505 U.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (emphasis added), see also id., at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But whether a particular obstacle qualifies as substantial is often open to reasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, substantial means of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or size. Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary 1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly substantial, and trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes, there is a wide gray area.",Alito,0,
2021-019,201,"This ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which applies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further. It states that measures designed to ensure that the woman's choice is informed are constitutional so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the right. Casey, 505 U.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791. To the extent that this rule applies to pre-viability abortions, it overlaps with the first rule and appears to impose a different standard. Consider a law that imposes an insubstantial obstacle but serves little purpose. As applied to a pre-viability abortion, would such a regulation be constitutional on the ground that it does not impose a substantial obstacle? Or would it be unconstitutional  on the ground that it creates an undue burden because the burden it imposes, though slight, outweighs its negligible benefits? Casey does not say, and this ambiguity would lead to confusion down the line. Compare June Medical, 591 U.S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2112 (plurality opinion), with id., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2135-2136 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring).",Alito,0,
2021-019,202,"The third rule complicates the picture even more. Under that rule, unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right. Casey, 505 U.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (emphasis added). This rule contains no fewer than three vague terms. It includes the two already discussed—undue burden and substantial obstacle—even though they are inconsistent. And it adds a third ambiguous term when it refers to unnecessary health regulations. The term necessary has a range of meanings —from essential to merely useful. See Black's Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979), American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 877 (1971). Casey did not explain the sense in which the term is used in this rule.",Alito,0,
2021-019,203,"In addition to these problems, one more applies to all three rules. They all call on courts to examine a law's effect on women, but a regulation may have a very different impact on different women for a variety of reasons, including their places of residence, financial resources, family situations, work and personal obligations, knowledge about fetal development and abortion, psychological and emotional disposition and condition, and the firmness of their desire to obtain abortions. In order to determine whether a regulation presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs to know which set of women it should have in mind and how many of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is substantial.",Alito,0,
2021-019,204,"Casey provided no clear answer to these questions. It said that a regulation is unconstitutional if it imposes a substantial obstacle in a large fraction of cases in which it is relevant, 505 U.S. at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791, but there is obviously no clear line between a fraction that is large and one that is not. Nor is it clear what the Court meant by cases in which a regulation is relevant. These ambiguities have caused confusion and disagreement. Compare Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582, 627-628, 136 S.Ct. 2292, 195 L.Ed.2d 665 (2016), with id., at 666-667, and n. 11, 136 S.Ct. 2292 (ALITO, J., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2021-019,206,"The difficulty of applying Casey's new rules surfaced in that very case. The controlling opinion found that Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period requirement and its informed-consent provision did not impose undue burdens, Casey, 505 U.S. at 881-887, 112 S.Ct. 2791, but Justice Stevens, applying the same test, reached the opposite result, id., at 920-922, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That did not bode well, and then-Chief Justice Rehnquist aptly observed that the undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework. Id., at 964-966, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (dissenting opinion).",Alito,0,
2021-019,207,"The ambiguity of the undue burden test also produced disagreement in later cases. In Whole Woman's Health, the Court adopted the cost-benefit interpretation of the test, stating that the rule announced in Casey  requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer. 579 U.S. at 607, 136  S.Ct. 2292 (emphasis added). But five years later, a majority of the Justices rejected that interpretation. See June Medical, 591 U.S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 2103, 207 L.Ed.2d 566. Four Justices reaffirmed Whole Woman's Health's instruction to weigh a law's benefits against the burdens it imposes on abortion access. 591 U.S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2135 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). But THE CHIEF JUSTICE— who cast the deciding vote—argued that nothing about Casey suggested that a weighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was a job for the courts. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2136 (opinion concurring in judgment). And the four Justices in dissent rejected the plurality's interpretation of Casey. See 591 U.S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2154-2155 (opinion of ALITO, J., joined in relevant part by THOMAS, GORSUCH, and KAVANAUGH, JJ.), id., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2178-2180 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.), id., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2182 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.)

In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that those traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally unplanned activity, and reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. For these reasons, we agree with the Casey plurality that conventional, concrete reliance interests are not present here.",Alito,0,

It wrote that people had organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society  in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail and that the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. But this Court is ill-equipped to assess generalized assertions about the national psyche. Id., at 957, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.).

That form of reliance depends on an empirical question that is hard for anyone—and in particular, for a court—to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion right on society and in particular on the lives of women. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women.

The contending sides also make conflicting arguments about the status of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority nor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Casey plurality's speculations and weighing of the relative importance of the fetus and mother represent a departure from the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.

Women are not without electoral or political power. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so.66 In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5 percent of the population of Mississippi,67 constituted 55.5 percent of the voters who cast ballots.68",Alito,0,

A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made under fire and as a surrender to political pressure, 505 U.S. at 867, 112 S.Ct. 2791, and therefore the preservation of public approval of the Court weighs heavily in favor of retaining Roe, see 505 U.S. at 869, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Alito,0,

The Casey plurality was certainly right that it is important for the public to perceive that our decisions are based on principle, and we should make every effort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that carefully show how a proper understanding of the law leads to the results we reach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the Constitution, and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction to our work. Cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), Brown, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873. That is true both when we initially decide a constitutional issue and when we consider whether to overrule a prior decision. As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained, The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task. Casey, 505 U.S. at 963, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). In suggesting otherwise, the Casey plurality went beyond this Court's role in our constitutional system.",Alito,0,
2021-019,233,"The Casey plurality called the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division, and claimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of the issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying that the matter was closed. Id., at 867, 112 S.Ct. 2791. That unprecedented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Constitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Constitution gives the judiciary neither Force nor Will. The Federalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole authority is to exercise judgment— which is to say, the authority to judge what the law means and how it should apply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently exempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Lochner  would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis operates.",Alito,0,
2021-019,234,"The Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of this Court's influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in ending division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe inflamed a national issue that has remained bitterly divisive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U.S. at 995, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of Scalia, J.), see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may have halted a political process, prolonged divisiveness, and deferred stable settlement of the issue). And for the past 30 years, Casey has done the same.",Alito,0,
2021-019,235,"Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this case, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey and to return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives. This Court's inability to end debate on the issue should not have been surprising. This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on. Whatever influence the Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the strength of our opinions, not an attempt to exercise raw judicial power. Roe, 410 U.S. at 222, 93 S.Ct. 762 (White, J., dissenting).",Alito,0,
2021-019,236,"We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today's decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly.",Alito,0,
2021-019,237,"We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.",Alito,0,
2021-019,241,"The dissent argues that we have abandoned stare decisis, post, at 2333-2334, but we have done no such thing, and it is the dissent's understanding of stare decisis that breaks with tradition. The dissent's foundational contention is that the Court should never (or perhaps almost never) overrule an egregiously wrong constitutional precedent unless the Court can point to major legal or factual changes undermining the decision's original basis. Post, at 2337. To support this contention, the dissent claims that Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, and other landmark cases overruling prior precedents responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. Post, at 2341. The unmistakable implication of this argument is that only the passage of time and new developments justified those decisions. Recognition that the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the day they were handed down was not enough.",Alito,0,
2021-019,242,"The Court has never adopted this strange new version of stare decisis—and with good reason. Does the dissent really maintain that overruling Plessy was not justified until the country had experienced more than a half-century of state-sanctioned segregation and generations of Black school children had suffered all its effects? Post, at 2341-2342.",Alito,0,
2021-019,243,"Here is another example. On the dissent's view, it must have been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628, to overrule Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 84 L.Ed. 1375, a bare three years after it was handed down. In both cases, children who were Jehovah's Witnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or recite the pledge of allegiance. The Barnette Court did not claim that its reexamination of the issue was prompted by any intervening legal or factual developments, so if the Court had followed the dissent's new version of stare decisis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Gobitis and countenance continued First Amendment violations for some unspecified period.",Alito,0,
2021-019,244,"Precedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court errs, and occasionally the Court issues an important decision that is egregiously wrong. When that happens, stare decisis is not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent eventually admits that a decision could be overruled just because it is terribly wrong, though the dissent does not explain when that would be so. Post, at 2342.",Alito,0,
2021-019,246,"Even if the dissent were correct in arguing that an egregiously wrong decision should (almost) never be overruled unless its mistake is later highlighted by major legal or factual changes, reexamination of Roe and Casey would be amply justified. We have already mentioned a number of post-Casey developments, see supra, at 2258-2259, 2273-2276, but the most profound change may be the failure of the Casey plurality's call for the contending sides in the controversy about abortion to end their national division, 505 U.S. at 867, 112 S.Ct. 2791. That has not happened, and there is no reason to think that another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what Casey could not.",Alito,0,
2021-019,247,"The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends that the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey is an important stare decisis consideration that requires upholding those precedents. See post, at 2347. The dissent characterizes Casey as a precedent about precedent that is permanently shielded from further evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. See post, at 2348-2349. But as we have explained, Casey broke new ground when it treated the national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for refusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case has relied on that factor. Our decision today simply applies longstanding stare decisis factors instead of applying a version of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion cases.",Alito,0,
2021-019,249,"Finally, the dissent suggests that our decision calls into question Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Post, at 2318-2319, 2332, n. 8. But we have stated unequivocally that nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Supra, at 2277-2278. We have also explained why that is so: rights regarding contraception and same-sex relationships are inherently different from the right to abortion because the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey termed potential life. Roe, 410 U.S. at 150, 93 S.Ct. 705 (emphasis deleted), Casey, 505 U.S. at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Therefore, a right to abortion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights recognized in those other cases or by appeals to a broader right to autonomy. Supra, at 2258. It is hard to see how we could be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these cases are distinguishable,  there is a further point that the dissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare decisis analysis, and the factors that our doctrine instructs us to consider like reliance and workability are different for these cases than for our abortion jurisprudence.",Alito,0,
2021-019,252,"We now turn to the concurrence in the judgment, which reproves us for deciding whether Roe and Casey should be retained or overruled. That opinion (which for convenience we will call simply the concurrence) recommends a more measured course, which it defends based on what it claims is a straightforward stare decisis analysis. Post, at 2310 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). The concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all, post, at 2314, and would hold only that if the Constitution protects any such right, the right ends once women have had a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion, post, at 2310. The concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient to provide such an opportunity, but it would hold that 15 weeks, the period allowed under Mississippi's law, is enough—at least absent rare circumstances. Post, at 2310-2311, 2315-2316.",Alito,0,
2021-019,253,"There are serious problems with this approach, and it is revealing that nothing like it was recommended by either party. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor General have urged us either to reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. See supra, at 2242-2243. And when the specific approach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument, both respondents and the Solicitor General emphatically rejected it. Respondents' counsel termed it completely unworkable and less principled and less workable than viability. Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. The Solicitor General argued that abandoning the viability line would leave courts and others with no continued guidance. Id., at 101. What is more, the concurrence has not identified any of the more than 130 amicus briefs filed in this case that advocated its approach. The concurrence would do exactly what it criticizes Roe for doing: pulling out of thin air a test that no party or amicus asked the Court to adopt. Post, at 2311.",Alito,0,
2021-019,255,"The concurrence's most fundamental defect is its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence would discard the rule from Roe and Casey that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as `viable' outside the womb. Post, at 2311. But this rule was a critical component of the holdings in Roe and Casey, and stare decisis is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation, Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 384, 130 S.Ct. 876, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). Therefore, a new rule that discards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare decisis grounds.",Alito,0,
2021-019,256,"The concurrence concedes that its approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Casey were inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. Post, at 2314. But the concurrence asserts that the viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized, and can therefore be discarded without disturbing any past precedent. Post, at 2313-2314. That is simply incorrect.",Alito,0,
2021-019,257,"Roe's trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see 410 U.S. at 163-164, 93 S.Ct. 705, and viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions. For example,  in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788, the Court reiterated Roe's rule that a State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion at the stage subsequent to viability. 428 U.S. at 61, 96 S.Ct. 2831 (emphasis added). The Court then rejected a challenge to Missouri's definition of viability, holding that the State's definition was consistent with Roe's. 428 U.S. at 63-64, 96 S.Ct. 2831. If viability was not an essential part of the rule adopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make that comparison.",Alito,0,
2021-019,258,"The holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596, is even more instructive. In that case, the Court noted that prior cases had stressed viability and reiterated that viability is the critical point under Roe. 439 U.S. at 388-389, 99 S.Ct. 675. It then struck down Pennsylvania's definition of viability, id., at 389-394, 99 S.Ct. 675, and it is hard to see how the Court could have done that if Roe's discussion of viability was not part of its holding.",Alito,0,
2021-019,259,"When the Court reconsidered Roe in Casey, it left no doubt about the importance of the viability rule. It described the rule as Roe's central holding, 505 U.S. at 860, 112 S.Ct. 2791, and repeatedly stated that the right it reaffirmed was the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability. Id., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (emphasis added). See id., at 871, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce (emphasis added)), id., at 872, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (A woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability (emphasis added)), id., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (A State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability (emphasis added)).",Alito,0,
2021-019,260,"Our subsequent cases have continued to recognize the centrality of the viability rule. See Whole Women's Health, 579 U.S. at 589-590, 136 S.Ct. 2292 (A provision of law is constitutionally invalid, if the `purpose or effect' of the provision `is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability' (emphasis deleted and added)), id., at 627, 136 S.Ct. 2292 (We now use `viability' as the relevant point at which a State may begin limiting women's access to abortion for reasons unrelated to maternal health (emphasis added)).",Alito,0,
2021-019,261,"Not only is the new rule proposed by the concurrence inconsistent with Casey's unambiguous language, post, at 2314, it is also contrary to the judgment in that case and later abortion cases. In Casey, the Court held that Pennsylvania's spousal-notification provision was facially unconstitutional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to abortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had a reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U.S. at 887-898, 112 S.Ct. 2791. The same is true of Whole Women's Health, which held that certain rules that required physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital were facially unconstitutional because they placed a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion. 579 U.S. at 591, 136 S.Ct. 2292 (emphasis added).",Alito,0,
2021-019,262,"For all these reasons, stare decisis cannot justify the new reasonable opportunity rule propounded by the concurrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must stand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to show that this rule represents a correct interpretation of the Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the right to a reasonable opportunity  to obtain an abortion is `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' and `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 720-721, 117 S.Ct. 2258. Nor does it propound any other theory that could show that the Constitution supports its new rule. And if the Constitution protects a woman's right to obtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that right should end after the point at which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek an abortion. While the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial minimalism, we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow, it must also be right. Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 375, 130 S.Ct. 876 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). For the reasons that we have explained, the concurrence's approach is not.",Alito,0,
2021-019,264,"The concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all, post, at 2314, but another day would not be long in coming. Some States have set deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than Mississippi's. See, e.g., Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slatery, 14 F.4th at 414 (considering law with bans at cascading intervals of two to three weeks beginning at six weeks), reh'g en banc granted, 14 F. 4th at 550 (CA6 2021). If we held only that Mississippi's 15-week rule is constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on the constitutionality of a panoply of laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. The measured course charted by the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the Court answered the question that the concurrence seeks to defer.",Alito,0,
2021-019,265,"Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule suggested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the difficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example, if the period required to give women a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concurrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percentage of women make that choice, see post, at 2310-2311, 2314-2316, we would have to identify the relevant percentage. It would also be necessary to explain what the concurrence means when it refers to rare circumstances that might justify an exception. Post, at 2315-2316. And if this new right aims to give women a reasonable opportunity to get an abortion, it would be necessary to decide whether factors other than promptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether such an opportunity was available.",Alito,0,
2021-019,266,"In sum, the concurrence's quest for a middle way would only put off the day when we would be forced to confront the question we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and Casey would be prolonged. It is far better—for this Court and the country—to face up to the real issue without further delay.",Alito,0,
2021-019,268,We must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard.,Alito,0,
2021-019,270,"Under our precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges. As we have explained, procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right because such a right has no basis in the Constitution's text or in our Nation's history. See supra, at 2244-2262.",Alito,0,
2021-019,271,"It follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged  under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.

Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938).

The Mississippi Legislature's findings recount the stages of human prenatal development and assert the State's interest in protecting the life of the unborn. § 2(b)(i). The legislature also found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and evacuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of this procedure for nontherapeutic or elective reasons to be a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. § 2(b)(i)(8), see also Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 135-143, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (describing such procedures).

2021-019,406,"Justice THOMAS, concurring.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,407,"I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion. Respondents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Court well explains why, under our substantive due process precedents, the purported right to abortion is not a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition nor implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The idea that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment understood the Due Process Clause to protect a right to abortion is farcical. June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2103, 2151, 207 L.Ed.2d 566 (2020) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).",Thomas,0,
2021-019,408,"I write separately to emphasize a second, more fundamental reason why there is no abortion guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause. Considerable historical evidence indicates that due process of law merely required executive and judicial actors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law when depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 623, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Other sources, by contrast, suggest that due process of law prohibited legislatures from authorizing the deprivation of a person's life, liberty, or property without providing him the customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England. United States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U.S. ___, ___ 142 S.Ct. 1539, 1545, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (internal quotation  marks omitted). Either way, the Due Process Clause at most guarantees process. It does not, as the Court's substantive due process cases suppose, forbid the government to infringe certain `fundamental' liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993), see also, e.g., Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).",Thomas,0,
2021-019,409,"As I have previously explained, substantive due process is an oxymoron that lacks any basis in the Constitution. Johnson, 576 U.S. at 607-608, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), see also, e.g., Vaello Madero, 596 U.S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1545 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (Text and history provide little support for modern substantive due process doctrine). The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only `process' before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 811, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), see also United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 40, 114 S.Ct. 2018, 129 L.Ed.2d 22 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The resolution of this case is thus straightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not secure any substantive rights, it does not secure a right to abortion.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,410,"The Court today declines to disturb substantive due process jurisprudence generally or the doctrine's application in other, specific contexts. Cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives)*, Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts), and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015) (right to same-sex marriage), are not at issue. The Court's abortion cases are unique, see ante, at 2257-2258, 2277-2278, 2280-2281, and no party has asked us to decide whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised, McDonald, 561 U.S. at 813, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Thus, I agree that nothing in the Court's opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante, at 2277-2278.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,411,"For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is demonstrably erroneous, Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. ___ ___, 140 S.Ct. 1390, 1424, 206 L.Ed.2d 583 (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), we have a duty to correct the error established in those precedents, Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1960, 1984-1985, 204 L.Ed.2d 322 (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring). After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions  guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Court's substantive due process cases are privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Amdt. 14, § 1, see McDonald, 561 U.S. at 806, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). To answer that question, we would need to decide important antecedent questions, including whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects any rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution and, if so, how to identify those rights. See id., at 854, 130 S.Ct. 3020. That said, even if the Clause does protect unenumerated rights, the Court conclusively demonstrates that abortion is not one of them under any plausible interpretive approach. See ante, at 2248, n. 22.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,412,"Moreover, apart from being a demonstrably incorrect reading of the Due Process Clause, the legal fiction of substantive due process is particularly dangerous. McDonald, 561 U.S. at 811, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), accord, Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 722, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). At least three dangers favor jettisoning the doctrine entirely.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,413,"First, substantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority. Ibid. Because the Due Process Clause speaks only to `process,' the Court has long struggled to define what substantive rights it protects. Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 682, 692, 203 L.Ed.2d 11 (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). In practice, the Court's approach for identifying those fundamental rights unquestionably involves policymaking rather than neutral legal analysis. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 41-42, 114 S.Ct. 2018 (opinion of Scalia, J.), see also McDonald, 561 U.S. at 812, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (substantive due process is a jurisprudence devoid of a guiding principle). The Court divines new rights in line with its own, extraconstitutional value preferences and nullifies state laws that do not align with the judicially created guarantees. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 794, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (White, J., dissenting).",Thomas,0,
2021-019,414,"Nowhere is this exaltation of judicial policymaking clearer than this Court's abortion jurisprudence. In Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), the Court divined a right to abortion because it felt that the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty included a right of privacy that is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id., at 153, 93 S.Ct. 705. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the Court likewise identified an abortion guarantee in the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but, rather than a right of privacy, it invoked an ethereal right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Id., at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. As the Court's preferred manifestation of liberty changed, so, too, did the test used to protect it, as Roe's author lamented. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 930, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (The Roe framework is far more administrable, and far less manipulable, than the `undue burden' standard).",Thomas,0,
2021-019,415,"Now, in this case, the nature of the purported liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Respondents  and the United States propose no fewer than three different interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause. They include bodily integrity, personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, Brief for Respondents 21, and women's equal citizenship, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. That 50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake proves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,416,"Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies a fundamental right for one class of individuals, it invokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of statutes that deny the right to others. See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453-454, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972) (relying on Griswold to invalidate a state statute prohibiting distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons). Statutory classifications implicating certain nonfundamental rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review. See, e.g., Armour v. Indianapolis, 566 U.S. 673, 680, 132 S.Ct. 2073, 182 L.Ed.2d 998 (2012). Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally vague or overbroad those laws that impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. See, e.g., Johnson, 576 U.S. at 618-621, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. ___, ___ _ ___, 140 S.Ct. 1575, 1584-1585, 206 L.Ed.2d 866 (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring). In fact, our vagueness doctrine served as the basis for the first draft of the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, and it since has been deployed  to nullify even mild regulations of the abortion industry. Johnson, 576 U.S. at 620-621, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Therefore, regardless of the doctrinal context, the Court often demands extra justifications for encroachments on preferred rights while relaxing purportedly higher standards of review for lesspreferred rights. Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582, 640-642, 136 S.Ct. 2292, 195 L.Ed.2d 665 (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Substantive due process is the core inspiration for many of the Court's constitutionally unmoored policy judgments.",Thomas,0,
2021-019,417,"Third, substantive due process is often wielded to disastrous ends. Gamble, 587 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1989 (THOMAS, J., concurring). For instance, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1857), the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. See id., at 452. While Dred Scott was overruled on the battlefields of the Civil War and by constitutional amendment after Appomattox, Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 696, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), that overruling was purchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 240, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Now today, the Court rightly overrules Roe and Casey—two of this Court's most notoriously incorrect substantive due process decisions, Timbs, 586 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 686-687 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)—after more than 63 million abortions have been performed, see National Right to Life Committee, Abortion Statistics (Jan. 2022), https://www.nrlc.org/uploads/factsheets/FS01AbortionintheUS.pdf. The harm caused by  this Court's forays into substantive due process remains immeasurable.* * *",Thomas,0,
2021-019,418,"Because the Court properly applies our substantive due process precedents to reject the fabrication of a constitutional right to abortion, and because this case does not present the opportunity to reject substantive due process entirely, I join the Court's opinion. But, in future cases, we should follow the text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away. Carlton, 512 U.S. at 42, 114 S.Ct. 2018 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity.",Thomas,0,

2021-019,422,Abortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests in protecting fetal life. The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty.,Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,423,"On the one side, many pro-choice advocates forcefully argue that the ability to obtain an abortion is critically important for women's personal and professional lives, and for women's health. They contend that the widespread availability of abortion has been essential for women to advance in society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50 years. And they maintain that women must have the freedom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,424,"On the other side, many pro-life advocates forcefully argue that a fetus is a human life. They contend that all human life should be protected as a matter of human dignity and fundamental morality.

2021-019,425,"When it comes to abortion, one interest must prevail over the other at any given point in a pregnancy. Many Americans of good faith would prioritize the interests of the pregnant woman. Many other Americans of good faith instead would prioritize the interests in protecting fetal life—at least unless, for example, an abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother. Of course, many Americans are conflicted or have nuanced views that may vary depending on the particular time in pregnancy, or the particular circumstances of a pregnancy.",Kavanaugh,0,

The Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion. The text of the Constitution does not refer to or encompass abortion. To be sure, this Court has held that the Constitution protects unenumerated rights that are deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. But a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in American history and tradition, as the Court today thoroughly explains.1  On the question of abortion, the Constitution is therefore neither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral and leaves the issue for the people and their elected representatives to resolve through the democratic process in the States or Congress—like the numerous other difficult questions of American social and economic policy that the Constitution does not address.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,427,"Because the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion, this Court also must be scrupulously neutral. The nine unelected Members of this Court do not possess the constitutional authority to override the democratic process and to decree either a pro-life or a pro-choice abortion policy for all 330 million people in the United States.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,428,"Instead of adhering to the Constitution's neutrality, the Court in Roe took sides on the issue and unilaterally decreed that abortion was legal throughout the United States up to the point of viability (about 24 weeks of pregnancy). The Court's decision today properly returns the Court to a position of neutrality and restores the people's authority to address the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic self-government established by the Constitution.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,429,"Some amicus briefs argue that the Court today should not only overrule Roe and return to a position of judicial neutrality on abortion, but should go further and hold that the Constitution outlaws abortion throughout the United States. No Justice of this Court has ever advanced that position. I respect those who advocate for that position, just as I respect those who argue that this Court should hold that the Constitution legalizes pre-viability abortion throughout the United States. But both positions are wrong as a constitutional matter, in my view. The Constitution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,430,"To be clear, then, the Court's decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the contrary, the Court's decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process. Through that democratic process, the people and their representatives may decide to allow or limit abortion. As Justice Scalia stated, the States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 979, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,431,"Today's decision therefore does not prevent the numerous States that readily allow abortion from continuing to readily allow abortion. That includes, if they choose, the amici States supporting the plaintiff in this Court: New York, California, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii. By contrast, other States may maintain laws that more strictly limit abortion. After today's decision, all of the States may evaluate the competing interests and decide how to address this consequential issue.2  In arguing for a constitutional right to abortion that would override the people's choices in the democratic process, the plaintiff Jackson Women's Health Organization and its amici emphasize that the Constitution does not freeze the American people's rights as of 1791 or 1868. I fully agree. To begin, I agree that constitutional rights apply to situations that were unforeseen in 1791 or 1868—such as applying the First Amendment to the Internet or the Fourth Amendment to cars. Moreover, the Constitution authorizes the creation of new rights—state and federal, statutory and constitutional. But when it comes to creating new rights, the Constitution directs the people to the various processes of democratic self-government contemplated by the Constitution—state legislation, state constitutional amendments, federal legislation, and federal constitutional amendments.

2021-019,432,"The Constitution does not grant the nine unelected Members of this Court the unilateral authority to rewrite the Constitution to create new rights and liberties based on our own moral or policy views. As Justice Rehnquist stated, this Court has not been granted a roving commission, either by the Founding Fathers or by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, to strike down laws that are based upon notions of policy or morality suddenly found unacceptable by a majority of this Court.

2021-019,434,"In sum, the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion and allows the people and their elected representatives to address the issue through the democratic process. In my respectful view, the Court in Roe therefore erred by taking sides on the issue of abortion.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,436,"The more difficult question in this case is stare decisis—that is, whether to overrule the Roe decision.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,437,The principle of stare decisis requires respect for the Court's precedents and for the accumulated wisdom of the judges who have previously addressed the same issue. Stare decisis is rooted in Article III of the Constitution and is fundamental to the American judicial system and to the stability of American law.,Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,438,"Adherence to precedent is the norm, and stare decisis imposes a high bar before  this Court may overrule a precedent. This Court's history shows, however, that stare decisis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute. Otherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-since-overruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905), Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 84 L.Ed. 1375 (1940), and Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986), would never have been overruled and would still be the law.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,439,"In his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis stated that in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815-407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of the Court's practice remains accurate today. Every current Member of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And over the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Taft's appointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed to this Court has voted to overrule precedent. Many of those Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number of very significant and longstanding precedents. See, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015) (overruling Baker v. Nelson), Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson), West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 578, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C. and in effect Lochner v. New York).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,440,"But that history alone does not answer the critical question: When precisely should the Court overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent? The history of stare decisis in this Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may be overruled only when (i) the prior decision is not just wrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has caused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would not unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. ___, ___ _ ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1414-1415 (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in part).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,441,"Applying those factors, I agree with the Court today that Roe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously assigned itself the authority to decide a critically important moral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant this Court the authority to decide. As Justice Byron White succinctly explained, Roe was an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review because nothing in the language or history of the Constitution supports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolton, 410 U.S. at 221-222, 93 S.Ct. 739 (dissenting opinion).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,442,"Of course, the fact that a precedent is wrong, even egregiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent should be overruled. But as the Court today explains, Roe has caused significant negative jurisprudential and real-world consequences. By taking sides on a difficult and contentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe overreached and exceeded this Court's constitutional authority, gravely distorted the Nation's understanding of this Court's proper constitutional role, and caused significant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the State's important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life. 410 U.S. at 162, 93 S.Ct. 705. All of that explains why tens of millions of Americans—and the 26 States that explicitly  ask the Court to overrule Roe—do not accept Roe even 49 years later. Under the Court's longstanding stare decisis principles, Roe",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,443,should be overruled.3,Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,444,"But the stare decisis analysis here is somewhat more complicated because of Casey. In 1992, 19 years after Roe, Casey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The Court sought to find common ground that would resolve the abortion debate and end the national controversy. After careful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality reaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24 weeks), while also allowing somewhat more regulation of abortion than Roe had allowed.4",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,445,I have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who wrote the Casey plurality opinion. And I respect the Casey plurality's good-faith effort to locate some middle ground or compromise that could resolve this controversy for America.,Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,446,"But as has become increasingly evident over time, Casey's well-intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate. The national division has not ended. In recent years, a significant number of States have enacted abortion restrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot be dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those numerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and deeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who continue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24 weeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not sufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the State's important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life. 410 U.S. at 162, 93 S.Ct. 705. In this case, moreover, a majority of the States—26 in all—ask the Court to overrule Roe and return the abortion issue to the States.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,447,"In short, Casey's stare decisis analysis rested in part on a predictive judgment about the future development of state laws and of the people's views on the abortion issue. But that predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court today explains, the experience over the last 30 years conflicts with Casey's predictive judgment and  therefore undermines Casey's precedential force.5",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,448,"In any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare decisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe cannot be dictated by Casey alone. To illustrate that stare decisis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this Court had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and upheld the States' authority to segregate people on the basis of race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in 1954 have reaffirmed Plessy and upheld racially segregated schools simply because of that intervening 1924 precedent? Surely the answer is no.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,449,"In sum, I agree with the Court's application today of the principles of stare decisis and its conclusion that Roe should be overruled.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,451,"After today's decision, the nine Members of this Court will no longer decide the basic legality of pre-viability abortion for all 330 million Americans. That issue will be resolved by the people and their representatives in the democratic process in the States or Congress. But the parties' arguments have raised other related questions, and I address some of them here.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,452,"First is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as contraception and marriage— in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967), and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015). I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,453,"Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by today's decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May a State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before today's decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Cf. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,454,"Other abortion-related legal questions may emerge in the future. But this Court will no longer decide the fundamental question of whether abortion must be allowed throughout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15 weeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line. The Court will no longer decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant woman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout pregnancy. Instead, those difficult moral and policy questions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,456,"The Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and policy issue that this Court had no constitutional authority to decide. By taking sides, the Roe Court distorted the Nation's understanding of this Court's proper role in the American constitutional system and thereby damaged the Court as an institution. As Justice Scalia explained, Roe destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level. Casey, 505 U.S. at 995, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,457,"The Court's decision today properly returns the Court to a position of judicial neutrality on the issue of abortion, and properly restores the people's authority to resolve the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic selfgovernment established by the Constitution.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,458,"To be sure, many Americans will disagree with the Court's decision today. That would be true no matter how the Court decided this case. Both sides on the abortion issue believe sincerely and passionately in the rightness of their cause. Especially in those difficult and fraught circumstances, the Court must scrupulously adhere to the Constitution's neutral position on the issue of abortion.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,459,"Since 1973, more than 20 Justices of this Court have now grappled with the divisive issue of abortion. I greatly respect all of the Justices, past and present, who have done so. Amidst extraordinary controversy and challenges, all of them have addressed the abortion issue in good faith after careful deliberation, and based on their sincere understandings of the Constitution and of precedent. I have endeavored to do the same.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,460,"In my judgment, on the issue of abortion, the Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral, and this Court likewise must be scrupulously neutral. The Court today properly heeds the constitutional principle of judicial neutrality and returns the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-019,461,"Chief Justice ROBERTS, concurring in the judgment.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,462,"We granted certiorari to decide one question: Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional. Pet. for Cert. i. That question is directly implicated here: Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, Miss. Code Ann. § 41-41-191 (2018), generally prohibits abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy— several weeks before a fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. In urging our review, Mississippi stated that its case was an ideal vehicle to reconsider the bright-line viability rule, and that a judgment in its favor would not require the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). Pet. for Cert. 5.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,463,"Today, the Court nonetheless rules for Mississippi by doing just that. I would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the viability line established by Roe and Casey should be discarded under a straightforward stare decisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abortion precedents describe the right at issue as a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further—certainly not all the way to viability. Mississippi's law allows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well  beyond the point at which it is considered late to discover a pregnancy. See A. Ayoola, Late Recognition of Unintended Pregnancies, 32 Pub. Health Nursing 462 (2015) (pregnancy is discoverable and ordinarily discovered by six weeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioning the adequacy of that opportunity.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,464,"But that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple yet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always perfect in following that command, and certainly there are cases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of them. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court's opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,466,"Let me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the only question we need decide here: whether to retain the rule from Roe and Casey that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. I agree that this rule should be discarded.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,467,"First, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its substantial interests in the area of abortion. See ante, at 2268-2270. Roe set forth a rigid three-part framework anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a regulatory code than a body of constitutional law. That framework, moreover, came out of thin air. Neither the Texas statute challenged in Roe nor the Georgia statute at issue in its companion case, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973), included any gestational age limit. No party or amicus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule. And as for Casey, arguments for or against the viability rule played only a de minimis role in the parties' briefing and in the oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18, 51 (fleeting discussion of the viability rule).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,468,"It is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Casey made a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the time for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability. The Court's jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illustration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented nor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe's defense of the line boiled down to the circular assertion that the State's interest is compelling only when an unborn child can live outside the womb, because that is when the unborn child can live outside the womb. See 410 U.S. at 163-164, 93 S.Ct. 705, see also J. Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973) (Roe's reasoning mistakes a definition for a syllogism).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,469,"Twenty years later, the best defense of the viability line the Casey plurality could conjure up was workability. See 505 U.S. at 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But see ante, at 2270 (opinion of the Court) (discussing the difficulties in applying the viability standard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content by opining that it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child, Casey, 505 U.S. at 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791, that mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viability as the critical  tipping point. A similar implied consent argument could be made with respect to a law banning abortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at which nearly all women are aware that they are pregnant, A. Ayoola, M. Nettleman, M. Stommel, & R. Canady, Time of Pregnancy Recognition and Prenatal Care Use: A Population-based Study in the United States 39 (2010) (Pregnancy Recognition). The dissent, which would retain the viability line, offers no justification for it either.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,470,"This Court's jurisprudence since Casey, moreover, has eroded the underpinnings of the viability line, such as they were. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 521, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). The viability line is a relic of a time when we recognized only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion: maternal health and protection of potential life. Roe, 410 U.S. at 162-163, 93 S.Ct. 705. That changed with Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007). There, we recognized a broader array of interests, such as drawing a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, maintaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Id., at 157-160, 127 S.Ct. 1610. The viability line has nothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf. id., at 171, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (Gonzales blurred the line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability and postviability abortions), see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Casey, and the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276-279 (2009).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,471,"Consider, for example, statutes passed in a number of jurisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of pregnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of development. See, e.g., Ala. Code § 26-23B-2 (2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legitimate state interest after Gonzales, there seems to be no reason why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of such laws. The same is true of laws designed to protect the integrity and ethics of the medical profession and restrict procedures likely to coarsen society to the dignity of human life. Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 157, 127 S.Ct. 1610. Mississippi's law, for instance, was premised in part on the legislature's finding that the dilation and evacuation procedure is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. Miss. Code Ann. § 41-41-191(2)(b)(i)(8). That procedure accounts for most abortions performed after the first trimester— two weeks before the period at issue in this case—and involves the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child apart. Ibid., see also Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 135, 127 S.Ct. 1610. Again, it would make little sense to focus on viability when evaluating a law based on these permissible goals.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,472,"In short, the viability rule was created outside the ordinary course of litigation, is and always has been completely unreasoned, and fails to take account of state interests since recognized as legitimate. It is indeed telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew a viability line. Ante, at 2270 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of countries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective abortions after twenty weeks, the rest have coalesced around a 12-week line. See The World's Abortion Laws, Center for Reproductive Rights (Feb. 23, 2021) (online source archived at www.supremecourt.gov) (Canada, China, Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam permit elective abortions after twenty weeks). The Court rightly rejects the arbitrary viability rule today.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,474,"None of this, however, requires that we also take the dramatic step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in Roe. Mississippi itself previously argued as much to this Court in this litigation.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,475,"When the State petitioned for our review, its basic request was straightforward: clarify whether abortion prohibitions before viability are always unconstitutional. Pet. for Cert. 14. The State made a number of strong arguments that the answer is no, id., at 15-26—arguments that, as discussed, I find persuasive. And it went out of its way to make clear that it was not asking the Court to repudiate entirely the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy: To be clear, the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn Roe or Casey. Id., at 5. Mississippi tempered that statement with an oblique one-sentence footnote intimating that, if the Court could not reconcile Roe and Casey with current facts or other cases, it should not retain erroneous precedent. Pet. for Cert. 5-6, n. 1. But the State never argued that we should grant review for that purpose.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,476,"After we granted certiorari, however, Mississippi changed course. In its principal brief, the State bluntly announced that the Court should overrule Roe and Casey. The Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion, it argued, and a State should be able to prohibit elective abortions if a rational basis supports doing so. See Brief for Petitioners 12-13.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,477,"The Court now rewards that gambit, noting three times that the parties presented no half-measures and argued that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Ante, at 2242, 2244, 2281. Given those two options, the majority picks the latter.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,478,"This framing is not accurate. In its brief on the merits, Mississippi in fact argued at length that a decision simply rejecting the viability rule would result in a judgment in its favor. See Brief for Petitioners 5, 38-48. But even if the State had not argued as much, it would not matter. There is no rule that parties can confine this Court to disposing of their case on a particular ground—let alone when review was sought and granted on a different one. Our established practice is instead not to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008) (quoting Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)), see also United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,479,"Following that fundamental principle of judicial restraint, Washington State Grange, 552 U.S. at 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184, we should begin with the narrowest basis for disposition, proceeding to consider a broader one only if necessary to resolve the case at hand. See, e.g., Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 423, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990). It is only where there is no valid narrower ground of decision that we should go on to address a broader issue, such as whether a constitutional decision should be overturned. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 482, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (declining to address the claim that a constitutional decision should be overruled when the appellant prevailed on its narrower constitutional argument).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,480,"Here, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly without overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: recognize that the viability line must be discarded, as the majority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 518, 521, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (plurality opinion) (rejecting Roe's viability line as rigid and indeterminate, while also finding no occasion to revisit the holding of Roe that, under the Constitution, a State must provide an opportunity to choose to terminate a pregnancy).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,481,"Of course, such an approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Casey was inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. It is not. Our precedents in this area ground the abortion right in a woman's right to choose. See Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 688-689, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977) (underlying foundation of the holdings in Roe and Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), was the right of decision in matters of childbearing), Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 473, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977) (Roe and other cases recognize a constitutionally protected interest in making certain kinds of important decisions free from governmental compulsion (internal quotation marks omitted)), id., at 473-474, 97 S.Ct. 2376 (Roe did not declare an unqualified constitutional right to an abortion, but instead protected the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy (internal quotation marks omitted)), Webster, 492 U.S. at 520, 109 S.Ct. 3040 (plurality opinion) (Roe protects the claims of a woman to decide for herself whether or not to abort a fetus she is carrying), Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 146, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy). If that is the basis for Roe, Roe's viability line should be scrutinized from the same perspective. And there is nothing inherent in the right to choose that requires it to extend to viability or any other point, so long as a real choice is provided. See Webster, 492 U.S. at 519, 109 S.Ct. 3040 (plurality opinion) (finding no reason why the State's interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability).",Roberts,0,
2021-019,482,"To be sure, in reaffirming the right to an abortion, Casey termed the viability rule Roe's central holding. 505 U.S. at 860, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Other cases of ours have repeated that language. See, e.g., Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 145-146, 127 S.Ct. 1610. But simply declaring it does not make it so. The question in Roe was whether there was any right to abortion in the Constitution. See Brief for Appellants and Brief for Appellees, in Roe v. Wade, O. T. 1971, No. 70-18. How far the right extended was a concern that was separate and subsidiary, and—not surprisingly—entirely unbriefed.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,483,"The Court in Roe just chose to address both issues in one opinion: It first recognized a right to choose to terminate a pregnancy under the Constitution, see 410 U.S. at 129-159, 93 S.Ct. 705, and then, having done so, explained that a line should be drawn at viability such that a State could not proscribe abortion before that period, see id., at 163, 93 S.Ct. 705. The viability line is a separate rule fleshing out the metes and bounds of Roe's core holding. Applying principles of stare decisis, I would excise that additional rule— and only that rule—from our jurisprudence.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,484,"The majority lists a number of cases that have stressed the importance of the  viability rule to our abortion precedents. See ante, at 2281-2282. I agree that— whether it was originally holding or dictum —the viability line is clearly part of our past precedent, and the Court has applied it as such in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 2281-2282. My point is that Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law: one, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, two, that such right may be overridden by the State's legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside the womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former. I would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this case to consider the basic right.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,485,"The Court contends that it is impossible to address Roe's conclusion that the Constitution protects the woman's right to abortion, without also addressing Roe's rule that the State's interests are not constitutionally adequate to justify a ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have partially overruled precedents before, see, e.g., United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130, 142-144, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985), Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 328-331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 90-93, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and certainly have never held that a distinct holding defining the contours of a constitutional right must be treated as part and parcel of the right itself.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,486,"Overruling the subsidiary rule is sufficient to resolve this case in Mississippi's favor. The law at issue allows abortions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate opportunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a pregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy is well into the second trimester. Pregnancy tests are now inexpensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers she is pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Branum & K. Ahrens, Trends in Timing of Pregnancy Awareness Among US Women, 21 Maternal & Child Health J. 715, 722 (2017). Almost all know by the end of the first trimester. Pregnancy Recognition 39. Safe and effective abortifacients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly during those early stages. See I. Adibi et al., Abortion, 22 Geo. J. Gender & L. 279, 303 (2021). Given all this, it is no surprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester. See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion Surveillance—United States 1 (2020). Presumably most of the remainder would also take place earlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample evidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances, for a woman to decide for herself whether to terminate her pregnancy. Webster, 492 U.S. at 520, 109 S.Ct. 3040 (plurality opinion).1",Roberts,0,
2021-019,488,"Whether a precedent should be overruled is a question entirely within the discretion of the court. Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 212, 30 S.Ct. 621, 54 L.Ed. 1001 (1910), see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (stare decisis is a principle of policy). In my respectful  view, the sound exercise of that discretion should have led the Court to resolve the case on the narrower grounds set forth above, rather than overruling Roe and Casey entirely. The Court says there is no principled basis for this approach, ante, at 2281-2282, but in fact it is firmly grounded in basic principles of stare decisis and judicial restraint.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,489,"The Court's decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a serious jolt to the legal system —regardless of how you view those cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and nothing more is needed to decide this case.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,490,"Our cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on reliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether to take such a step, and respondents argue that generations of women have relied on the right to an abortion in organizing their relationships and planning their futures. Brief for Respondents 36-41, see also Casey, 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (making the same point). The Court questions whether these concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see ante, at 2276-2277, but the issue would not even arise with a decision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasonably be argued that women have shaped their lives in part on the assumption that they would be able to abort up to viability, as opposed to fifteen weeks.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,491,"In support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal constitutional decisions that involved overruling prior precedents: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 578, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937). See ante, at 2262-2264. The opinion in Brown was unanimous and eleven pages long, this one is neither. Barnette was decided only three years after the decision it overruled, three Justices having had second thoughts. And West Coast Hotel was issued against a backdrop of unprecedented economic despair that focused attention on the fundamental flaws of existing precedent. It also was part of a sea change in this Court's interpretation of the Constitution, signaling the demise of an entire line of important precedents, ante, at 2262—a feature the Court expressly disclaims in today's decision, see ante, at 2257-2258, 2277-2278. None of these leading cases, in short, provides a template for what the Court does today.",Roberts,0,
2021-019,492,"The Court says we should consider whether to overrule Roe and Casey now, because if we delay we would be forced to consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 2283-2284. There would be turmoil until we did so, according to the Court, because of existing state laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. Ante, at 2283. But under the narrower approach proposed here, state laws outlawing abortion altogether would still violate binding precedent. And to the extent States have laws that set the cutoff date earlier than fifteen weeks, any litigation over that timeframe would proceed free of the distorting effect that the viability rule has had on our constitutional debate. The same could be true, for that matter, with respect to legislative consideration in the States. We would then be free to exercise our discretion in deciding whether and when to take up the issue, from a more informed perspective.* * *",Roberts,0,
2021-019,493,"Both the Court's opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of  conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks. A thoughtful Member of this Court once counseled that the difficulty of a question admonishes us to observe the wise limitations on our function and to confine ourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the immediate case. Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U.S. 366, 372-373, 75 S.Ct. 845, 99 L.Ed. 1155 (1955) (Frankfurter, J., for the Court). I would decide the question we granted review to answer—whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such that a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is necessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no, and there is no need to go further to decide this case.",Roberts,0,

2021-019,496,"For half a century, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), have protected the liberty and equality of women. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a woman's right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women. The government could not control a woman's body or the course of a woman's life: It could not determine what the woman's future would be. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 853, 112 S.Ct. 2791, Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 171-172, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,497,"Roe and Casey well understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different views about the morality of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Casey, 505 U.S. at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And the Court recognized that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child. Id., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete. It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman's life or health. It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a substantial obstacle on a woman's right to elect the procedure as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,498,"Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life is rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of restrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majority's ruling, though, another State's law could do so after ten weeks, or five or three or one—or, again, from the moment  of fertilization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipation of today's ruling. More will follow. Some States have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking medication in one's own home. They have passed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist's child or a young girl her father's— no matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too, after today's ruling, some States may compel women to carry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies—for example, one afflicted with Tay-Sachs disease, sure to die within a few years of birth. States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,499,"Enforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also be left largely to the States' devices. A State can of course impose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including lengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop there. Perhaps, in the wake of today's decision, a state law will criminalize the woman's conduct too, incarcerating or fining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion. And as Texas has recently shown, a State can turn neighbor against neighbor, enlisting fellow citizens in the effort to root out anyone who tries to get an abortion, or to assist another in doing so.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,500,"The majority tries to hide the geographically expansive effects of its holding. Today's decision, the majority says, permits each State to address abortion as it pleases. Ante, at 2284-2285. That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor woman who cannot get the money to fly to a distant State for a procedure. Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today's decision. In any event, interstate restrictions will also soon be in the offing. After this decision, some States may block women from traveling out of State to obtain abortions, or even from receiving abortion medications from out of State. Some may criminalize efforts, including the provision of information or funding, to help women gain access to other States' abortion services. Most threatening of all, no language in today's decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens, the views of an individual State's citizens will not matter. Ante, at 2240. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to New York or California but to Toronto. Ante, at 2305-2306 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,501,"Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today's decision is certain: the curtailment of women's rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yesterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a woman confronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reasonable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a child, with all the life-transforming consequences that act involves. And in thus safeguarding each woman's reproductive freedom, the Constitution also protected the ability of women to participate equally in this Nation's economic and social life. Casey, 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But no longer. As of today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare. Some women, especially women of means, will find ways around the State's assertion of power. Others —those without money or childcare or  the ability to take time off from work—will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an unsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even die. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child, but at significant personal or familial cost. At the least, they will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The Constitution will, today's majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,502,"And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972). In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015). They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions. The majority (or to be more accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today that nothing it does casts doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante, at 2277-2278, cf. ante, at 2301-2302 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (advocating the overruling of Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for what the majority does today is that the right to elect an abortion is not deeply rooted in history: Not until Roe, the majority argues, did people think abortion fell within the Constitution's guarantee of liberty. Ante, at 2257-2258. The same could be said, though, of most of the rights the majority claims it is not tampering with. The majority could write just as long an opinion showing, for example, that until the mid-20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain contraceptives. Ante, at 2248. So one of two things must be true. Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority's opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,503,"One piece of evidence on that score seems especially salient: The majority's cavalier approach to overturning this Court's precedents. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase for a foundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided should stay decided unless there is a very good reason for change. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility. Those qualities are not evident in today's opinion. The majority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society it sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for decades, shaping women's expectations of their choices when an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied on the availability of abortion both in structuring their relationships and in planning their lives. The legal framework Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing interests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country. No recent developments, in either law or fact, have eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in short, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Casey already found all of that to be true. Casey is a precedent about precedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in support of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not warranted. The  Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 265, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986). Today, the proclivities of individuals rule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law. We dissent.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,505,"We start with Roe and Casey, and with their deep connections to a broad swath of this Court's precedents. To hear the majority tell the tale, Roe and Casey are aberrations: They came from nowhere, went nowhere—and so are easy to excise from this Nation's constitutional law. That is not true. After describing the decisions themselves, we explain how they are rooted in—and themselves led to—other rights giving individuals control over their bodies and their most personal and intimate associations. The majority does not wish to talk about these matters for obvious reasons, to do so would both ground Roe and Casey in this Court's precedents and reveal the broad implications of today's decision. But the facts will not so handily disappear. Roe and Casey were from the beginning, and are even more now, embedded in core constitutional concepts of individual freedom, and of the equal rights of citizens to decide on the shape of their lives. Those legal concepts, one might even say, have gone far toward defining what it means to be an American. For in this Nation, we do not believe that a government controlling all private choices is compatible with a free people. So we do not (as the majority insists today) place everything within the reach of majorities and government officials. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943). We believe in a Constitution that puts some issues off limits to majority rule. Even in the face of public opposition, we uphold the right of individuals —yes, including women—to make their own choices and chart their own futures. Or at least, we did once.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,507,"Some half-century ago, Roe struck down a state law making it a crime to perform an abortion unless its purpose was to save a woman's life. The Roe Court knew it was treading on difficult and disputed ground. It understood that different people's experiences, values, and religious training and beliefs led to opposing views about abortion. 410 U.S. at 116, 93 S.Ct. 705. But by a 7-to-2 vote, the Court held that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, that contested and contestable choice must belong to a woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty, protected individual decisionmaking related to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. Id., at 152-153, 93 S.Ct. 705 (citations omitted). For the same reasons, the Court held, the Constitution must protect a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id., at 153, 93 S.Ct. 705. The Court recognized the myriad ways bearing a child can alter the life and future of a woman and other members of her family. Ibid.

No absolutist account of the woman's right could wipe away those significant state claims. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,509,"The Court therefore struck a balance, turning on the stage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur. The Court explained that early on, a woman's choice must prevail, but that at some point the state interests become dominant. Id., at 155, 93 S.Ct. 705. It then set some guideposts. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not interfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect the pregnant woman's health, such as by insisting that abortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. And after the fetus's viability —the point when the fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb—the State could ban abortions, except when necessary to preserve the woman's life or health. Id., at 163-164, 93 S.Ct. 705.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,510,"In the 20 years between Roe and Casey, the Court expressly reaffirmed Roe on two occasions, and applied it on many more. Recognizing that arguments against Roe continue to be made, we responded that the doctrine of stare decisis demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 419-420, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983). And we avowed that the vitality of constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 759, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986). So the Court, over and over, enforced the constitutional principles Roe had declared. See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U.S. 502, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990), Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417, 110 S.Ct. 2926, 111 L.Ed.2d 344 (1990), Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S.Ct. 2532, 76 L.Ed.2d 755 (1983), Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476, 103 S.Ct. 2517, 76 L.Ed.2d 733 (1983), H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398, 101 S.Ct. 1164, 67 L.Ed.2d 388 (1981), Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979), Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,511,"Then, in Casey, the Court considered the matter anew, and again upheld Roe's core precepts. Casey is in significant measure a precedent about the doctrine of precedent —until today, one of the Court's most important. But we leave for later that aspect of the Court's decision. The key thing now is the substantive aspect of the Court's considered conclusion that the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. 505 U.S. at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,512,"Central to that conclusion was a full-throated restatement of a woman's right to choose. Like Roe, Casey grounded that right in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty. That guarantee encompasses realms of conduct not specifically referenced in the Constitution: Marriage is mentioned nowhere in that document, yet the Court was no doubt correct to protect the freedom to marry against state interference. 505 U.S. at 847-848, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And the guarantee of liberty encompasses conduct today that was not protected at the time of the  Fourteenth Amendment. See id., at 848, 112 S.Ct. 2791. It is settled now, the Court said—though it was not always so—that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood, as well as bodily integrity. Id., at 849, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (citations omitted), see id., at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (similarly describing the constitutional protection given to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, and family relationships). Especially important in this web of precedents protecting an individual's most personal choices were those guaranteeing the right to contraception. Ibid., see id., at 852-853, 112 S.Ct. 2791. In those cases, the Court had recognized the right of the individual to make the vastly consequential decision whether to bear a child. Id., at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey reasoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman confronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about abortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to chart her life's course. See id., at 853, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,513,"In reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took full account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the importance of various competing state interests. Some Americans, the Court stated, deem abortion nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life. 505 U.S. at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And each State has an interest in the protection of potential life—as Roe itself had recognized. 505 U.S. at 871, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that interest was not conclusive. The State could not resolve the moral and spiritual questions raised by abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter. Id., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (majority opinion). It could not force her to bear the pain and physical constraints of carrying a child to full term when she would have chosen an early abortion. Id., at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But on the other hand, the State had, as Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in disallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And it had an ever-present interest in ensuring that the woman's choice is informed and in presenting the case for choosing childbirth over abortion. 505 U.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,514,"So Casey again struck a balance, differing from Roe's in only incremental ways. It retained Roe's central holding that the State could bar abortion only after viability. 505 U.S. at 860, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (majority opinion). The viability line, Casey thought, was more workable than any other in marking the place where the woman's liberty interest gave way to a State's efforts to preserve potential life. Id., at 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). At that point, a second life was capable of independent existence. Ibid. If the woman even by then had not acted, she lacked adequate grounds to object to the State's intervention on the developing child's behalf. Ibid. At the same time, Casey decided, based on two decades of experience, that the Roe framework did not give States sufficient ability to regulate abortion prior to viability. In that period, Casey now made clear, the State could regulate not only to protect the woman's health but also to promote prenatal life. 505 U.S. at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). In particular, the State could ensure informed choice and could try to promote childbirth. See id., at 877-878, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But the State still could not place an undue burden—or substantial obstacle—in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Id., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Prior to viability, the woman, consistent with the constitutional meaning of  liberty, must retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body. Id., at 869, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,515,"We make one initial point about this analysis in light of the majority's insistence that Roe and Casey, and we in defending them, are dismissive of a State's interest in protecting prenatal life. Ante, at 2261. Nothing could get those decisions more wrong. As just described, Roe and Casey invoked powerful state interests in that protection, operative at every stage of the pregnancy and overriding the woman's liberty after viability. The strength of those state interests is exactly why the Court allowed greater restrictions on the abortion right than on other rights deriving from the Fourteenth Amendment.1 But what Roe and Casey also recognized— which today's majority does not—is that a woman's freedom and equality are likewise involved. That fact—the presence of countervailing interests—is what made the abortion question hard, and what necessitated balancing. The majority scoffs at that idea, castigating us for repeatedly praising the `balance' the two cases arrived at (with the word balance in scare quotes). Ante, at 2261. To the majority balance is a dirty word, as moderation is a foreign concept. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman's rights to equality and freedom. Today's Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a woman's control of her body and the path of her life. Roe and Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some sense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our precedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime we have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing interests, and sought a balance between them. The constitutional regime we enter today erases the woman's interest and recognizes only the State's (or the Federal Government's).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,517,"The majority makes this change based on a single question: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey exist in 1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified? Ante, at 2252-2253. The majority says (and with this much we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In 1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy, and no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided one.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,518,"Of course, the majority opinion refers as well to some later and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes back as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century. See ante, at 2249. But that turns out to be wheel-spinning. First, it is not clear what relevance  such early history should have, even to the majority. See New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. ___ ___, 142 S.Ct. 2111, 2136, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (Historical evidence that long predates ratification may not illuminate the scope of the right). If the early history obviously supported abortion rights, the majority would no doubt say that only the views of the Fourteenth Amendment's ratifiers are germane. See ibid. (It is better not to go too far back into antiquity, except if olden law survived to become our Founders' law). Second—and embarrassingly for the majority—early law in fact does provide some support for abortion rights. Common-law authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before quickening—the point when the fetus moved in the womb.2 And early American law followed the common-law rule.3 So the criminal law of that early time might be taken as roughly consonant with Roe's and Casey's different treatment of early and late abortions. Better, then, to move forward in time. On the other side of 1868, the majority occasionally notes that many States barred abortion up to the time of Roe. See ante, at 2253, 2260. That is convenient for the majority, but it is window dressing. As the same majority (plus one) just informed us, post-ratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text. New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc., 597 U.S., at ___ _ ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2137. Had the pre-Roe liberalization of abortion laws occurred more quickly and more widely in the 20th century, the majority would say (once again) that only the ratifiers' views are germane.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,519,"The majority's core legal postulate, then, is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did. And that is indeed what the majority emphasizes over and over again. See ante, at 2267 (The most important historical fact is how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted), see also ante, at 2242-2243, 2248-2249, and n. 24, 23, 25, 28. If the ratifiers did not understand something as central to freedom, then neither can we. Or said more particularly: If those people did not understand reproductive rights as part of the guarantee of liberty conferred in the Fourteenth Amendment, then those rights do not exist.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,520,"As an initial matter, note a mistake in the just preceding sentence. We referred there to the people who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment: What rights did those people have in their heads at the time? But, of course, people did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for women's liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation. Indeed, the ratifiers—both in 1868 and when the original Constitution was approved in 1788—did not understand women as full members of the community  embraced by the phrase We the People. In 1868, the first wave of American feminists were explicitly told—of course by men—that it was not their time to seek constitutional protections. (Women would not get even the vote for another half-century.) To be sure, most women in 1868 also had a foreshortened view of their rights: If most men could not then imagine giving women control over their bodies, most women could not imagine having that kind of autonomy. But that takes away nothing from the core point. Those responsible for the original Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment, did not perceive women as equals, and did not recognize women's rights. When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,521,"Casey itself understood this point, as will become clear. See infra, at 2252-2253. It recollected with dismay a decision this Court issued just five years after the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, approving a State's decision to deny a law license to a woman and suggesting as well that a woman had no legal status apart from her husband. See 505 U.S. at 896-897, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (majority opinion) (citing Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130, 21 L.Ed. 442 (1873)). There was a time, Casey explained, when the Constitution did not protect men and women alike. 505 U.S. at 896, 112 S.Ct. 2791. But times had changed. A woman's place in society had changed, and constitutional law had changed along with it. The relegation of women to inferior status in either the public sphere or the family was no longer consistent with our understanding of the Constitution. Id., at 897, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Now, the Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, from the abuse of governmental power or unjustified state interference. Id., at 896, 898, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,522,"So how is it that, as Casey said, our Constitution, read now, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868? How is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination against them to heightened judicial scrutiny? How is it that our Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendment's liberty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not legally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for themselves whether and when to bear a child? How is it that until today, that same constitutional clause protected a woman's right, in the event contraception failed, to end a pregnancy in its earlier stages?",Breyer,0,
2021-019,523,"The answer is that this Court has rejected the majority's pinched view of how to read our Constitution. The Founders, we recently wrote, knew they were writing a document designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances over centuries. NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 533-534, 134 S.Ct. 2550, 189 L.Ed.2d 538 (2014). Or in the words of the great Chief Justice John Marshall, our Constitution is intended to endure for ages to come, and must adapt itself to a future seen dimly, if at all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it is. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that the world changes. So they did not define rights by reference to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead, the Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit future evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the course of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers' invitation. It has kept true to the Framers' principles by applying them in new ways, responsive to new societal understandings and conditions.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,524,"Nowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in construing the majestic but open-ended words of the Fourteenth Amendment—the guarantees of liberty and equality for all. And nowhere has that approach produced prouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider an example Obergefell used a few years ago. The Court there confronted a claim, based on Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997), that the Fourteenth Amendment must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices—exactly the view today's majority follows. Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 671, 135 S.Ct. 2584. And the Court specifically rejected that view.4 In doing so, the Court reflected on what the proposed, historically circumscribed approach would have meant for interracial marriage. See ibid. The Fourteenth Amendment's ratifiers did not think it gave black and white people a right to marry each other. To the contrary, contemporaneous practice deemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion. Yet the Court in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967), read the Fourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings' union. If, Obergefell explained, rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification—even when they conflict with liberty and equality as later and more broadly understood. 576 U.S. at 671, 135 S.Ct. 2584. The Constitution does not freeze for all time the original view of what those rights guarantee, or how they apply.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,525,"That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes people to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the original applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no others, or (2) surrender to judges' own ardent views, ungrounded in law, about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. Ante, at 2247. At least, that idea is what the majority sometimes tries to convey. At other times, the majority (or, rather, most of it) tries to assure the public that it has no designs on rights (for example, to contraception) that arose only in the back half of the 20th century—in other words, that it is happy to pick and choose, in accord with individual preferences. See ante, at 2257-2258, 2277-2278, 2280-2281, ante, at 2309 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring), but see ante, at 2301-2302 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But that is a matter we discuss later. See infra, at 2330-2333. For now, our point is different: It is that applications of liberty and equality can evolve while remaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitutional history, and constitutional precedents. The second Justice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance when he explained why he would have invalidated a State's ban on contraceptive use. Judges, he said, are not free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (dissenting opinion). Yet they also must recognize that the constitutional tradition of this country is not captured whole at a single moment. Ibid. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents —each looking to the last and each seeking to apply the Constitution's most fundamental commitments to new conditions.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,526,"That is why Americans, to go back to Obergefell's example, have a right to marry across racial lines. And it is why, to go back to Justice Harlan's case, Americans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose for themselves whether to have children.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,527,"All that is what Casey understood. Casey explicitly rejected the present majority's method. The specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, Casey stated, do not mark the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. 505 U.S. at 848, 112 S.Ct. 2791.5 To hold otherwise—as the majority does today—would be inconsistent with our law. Id., at 847, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Why? Because the Court has vindicated the principle over and over that (no matter the sentiment in 1868) there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter—especially relating to bodily integrity and family life. Id., at 847, 849, 851. Casey described in detail the Court's contraception cases. See id., at 848-849, 851-853, 112 S.Ct. 2791. It noted decisions protecting the right to marry, including to someone of another race. See id., at 847-848, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (Interracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference). In reviewing decades and decades of constitutional law, Casey could draw but one conclusion: Whatever was true in 1868, it is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood. Id., at 849, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,528,"And that conclusion still held good, until the Court's intervention here. It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at the time of Casey, and settled yesterday that the Constitution places limits on a State's power to assert control over an individual's body and most personal decisionmaking. A multitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roe's recognition and Casey's reaffirmation of the right to choose, and Roe and Casey in turn supported additional protections for intimate and familial relations. The majority has embarrassingly little to say about those precedents. It (literally) rattles them off in a single paragraph, and it implies that they have nothing to do with each other, or with the right to terminate an early pregnancy. See ante, at 2257-2258 (asserting that recognizing a relationship among them, as addressing aspects of personal autonomy, would ineluctably license fundamental rights to illegal drug use and prostitution). But that is flat wrong. The Court's precedents about bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations, and procreation are all interwoven —all part of the fabric of our constitutional law, and because that is so, of our lives. Especially women's lives, where they safeguard a right to self-determination.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,529,"And eliminating that right, we need to say before further describing our precedents, is not taking a neutral position, as Justice KAVANAUGH tries to argue. Ante, at 2304-2305, 2306, 2307-2308, 2309-2310 (concurring opinion). His idea is that neutrality lies in giving the abortion issue to the States, where some can go one way and some another. But would he say that the Court is being scrupulously neutral if it allowed New York and California to ban all the guns they want? Ante, at 2305. If the Court allowed some States to use unanimous juries and others not? If the Court told the States: Decide for yourselves whether to put restrictions on church attendance? We could go on—and in fact we will. Suppose Justice KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority opinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or historically grounded than the right to choose. What, then, of the right to contraception or same-sex marriage? Would it be scrupulously neutral for the Court to eliminate those rights too? The point of all these examples is that when it comes to rights, the Court does not act neutrally when it leaves everything up to the States. Rather, the Court acts neutrally when it protects the right against all comers. And to apply that point to the case here: When the Court decimates a right women have held for 50 years, the Court is not being scrupulously neutral. It is instead taking sides: against women who wish to exercise the right, and for States (like Mississippi) that want to bar them from doing so. Justice KAVANAUGH cannot obscure that point by appropriating the rhetoric of even-handedness. His position just is what it is: A brook-no-compromise refusal to recognize a woman's right to choose, from the first day of a pregnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be squared with this Court's longstanding view that women indeed have rights (whatever the state of the world in 1868) to make the most personal and consequential decisions about their bodies and their lives.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,530,"Consider first, then, the line of this Court's cases protecting bodily integrity. Casey, 505 U.S. at 849, 112 S.Ct. 2791. No right, in this Court's time-honored view, is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 35 L.Ed. 734 (1891), see Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 269, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990) (Every adult has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body). Or to put it more simply: Everyone, including women, owns their own bodies. So the Court has restricted the power of government to interfere with a person's medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical procedures or treatments. See, e.g., Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 766-767, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 84 L.Ed.2d 662 (1985) (forced surgery), Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 166, 173-174, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952) (forced stomach pumping), Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229, 236, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990) (forced administration of antipsychotic drugs).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,531,"Casey recognized the doctrinal affinity between those precedents and Roe. 505 U.S. at 857, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And that doctrinal affinity is born of a factual likeness. There are few greater incursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a pregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experiences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treatments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and medical risk. Just as one example, an American woman is 14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. See Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579  U.S. 582, 618, 136 S.Ct. 2292, 195 L.Ed.2d 665 (2016). That women happily undergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord does not lessen how far a State impinges on a woman's body when it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term. And for some women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically necessary to prevent harm. See 410 U.S. at 153, 93 S.Ct. 705. The majority does not say—which is itself ominous—whether a State may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion when she and her doctor have determined it is a needed medical treatment.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,532,"So too, Roe and Casey fit neatly into a long line of decisions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of private choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate relationships, and procreation. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 851, 857, 112 S.Ct. 2791, Roe, 410 U.S. at 152-153, 93 S.Ct. 705, see also ante, at 2257-2258 (listing the myriad decisions of this kind that Casey relied on). Those cases safeguard particular choices about whom to marry, whom to have sex with, what family members to live with, how to raise children— and crucially, whether and when to have children. In varied cases, the Court explained that those choices—the most intimate and personal a person can make— reflect fundamental aspects of personal identity, they define the very attributes of personhood. Casey, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And they inevitably shape the nature and future course of a person's life (and often the lives of those closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices belong to the individual, and not the government. That is the essence of what liberty requires.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,533,"And liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly said, even when those living in 1868 would not have recognized the claim—because they would not have seen the person making it as a full-fledged member of the community. Throughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has expanded, bringing in individuals formerly excluded. In that way, the constitutional values of liberty and equality go hand in hand, they do not inhabit the hermetically sealed containers the majority portrays. Compare Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 672-675, 135 S.Ct. 2584, with ante, at 2245-2246. So before Roe and Casey, the Court expanded in successive cases those who could claim the right to marry— though their relationships would have been outside the law's protection in the mid-19th century. See, e.g., Loving, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (interracial couples), Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (prisoners), see also, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651-652, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (offering constitutional protection to untraditional family units). And after Roe and Casey, of course, the Court continued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, the Court resolved that the Amendment also conferred on same-sex couples the right to marry. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508, Obergefell, 576 U.S. 644, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609. In considering that question, the Court held, history and tradition, especially as reflected in the course of our precedent, guide and discipline the inquiry. Id., at 664, 135 S.Ct. 2584. But the sentiments of 1868 alone do not and cannot rule the present. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,534,"Casey similarly recognized the need to extend the constitutional sphere of liberty to a previously excluded group. The Court then understood, as the majority today does not, that the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and wrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full and equal citizens. See supra, at 2248. A woman then, Casey wrote, had no  legal existence separate from her husband. 505 U.S. at 897, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Women were seen only as the center of home and family life, without full and independent legal status under the Constitution. Ibid. But that could not be true any longer: The State could not now insist on the historically dominant vision of the woman's role. Id., at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And equal citizenship, Casey realized, was inescapably connected to reproductive rights. The ability of women to participate equally in the life of the Nation—in all its economic, social, political, and legal aspects —has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Id., at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Without the ability to decide whether and when to have children, women could not—in the way men took for granted—determine how they would live their lives, and how they would contribute to the society around them.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,535,"For much that reason, Casey made clear that the precedents Roe most closely tracked were those involving contraception. Over the course of three cases, the Court had held that a right to use and gain access to contraception was part of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty. See Griswold, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510, Eisenstadt, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349, Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977). That clause, we explained, necessarily conferred a right to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. Eisenstadt, 405 U.S. at 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, see Carey, 431 U.S. at 684-685, 97 S.Ct. 2010. Casey saw Roe as of a piece: In critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character. 505 U.S. at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Reasonable people, the Court noted, could also oppose contraception, and indeed, they could believe that some forms of contraception similarly implicate a concern with potential life. Id., at 853, 859, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Yet the views of others could not automatically prevail against a woman's right to control her own body and make her own choice about whether to bear, and probably to raise, a child. When an unplanned pregnancy is involved—because either contraception or abortion is outlawed—the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition. Id., at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. No State could undertake to resolve the moral questions raised in such a definitive way as to deprive a woman of all choice. Id., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,536,"Faced with all these connections between Roe/Casey and judicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights, the majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says) neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.) Today's decision, the majority first says, does not undermine the decisions cited by Roe and Casey—the ones involving marriage, procreation, contraception, and family relationships —in any way. Ante, at 2257-2258, Casey, 505 U.S. at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Note that this first assurance does not extend to rights recognized after Roe and Casey, and partly based on them—in particular, rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage. See supra, at 2329-2330.6 On  its later tries, though, the majority includes those too: Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante, at 2277-2278, see ante, at 2280-2281. That right is unique, the majority asserts, because abortion terminates life or potential life. Ante, at 2277 (internal quotation marks omitted), see ante, at 2257-2258, 2280-2281. So the majority depicts today's decision as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only. Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 669, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting). Should the audience for these too-much-repeated protestations be duly satisfied? We think not.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,537,"The first problem with the majority's account comes from Justice THOMAS's concurrence—which makes clear he is not with the program. In saying that nothing in today's opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, Justice THOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at issue in this very case. See ante, at 2303-2304 (This case does not present the opportunity to reject those precedents). But he lets us know what he wants to do when they are. In future cases, he says, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Ante, at 2301, see also supra, at 2253-2254, and n. 6. And when we reconsider them? Then we have a duty to overrule these demonstrably erroneous decisions. Ante, at 2301. So at least one Justice is planning to use the ticket of today's decision again and again and again.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,538,"Even placing the concurrence to the side, the assurance in today's opinion still does not work. Or at least that is so if the majority is serious about its sole reason for overturning Roe and Casey: the legal status of abortion in the 19th century. Except in the places quoted above, the state interest in protecting fetal life plays no part in the majority's analysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in not expressing a view about the status of the fetus. Ante, at 2277, see ante, at 2257-2258 (aligning itself with Roe's and Casey's stance of not deciding whether life or potential life is involved), ante, at 2261-2262 (similar). The majority's departure from Roe and Casey rests instead—and only— on whether a woman's decision to end a pregnancy involves any Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which Roe and Casey balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life).7 According to the majority, no liberty interest is present— because (and only because) the law offered no protection to the woman's choice in the  19th century. But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States too—whatever the particular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten—does not even undermine —any number of other constitutional rights. Ante, at 2257-2258.8",Breyer,0,
2021-019,539,"Nor does it even help just to take the majority at its word. Assume the majority is sincere in saying, for whatever reason, that it will go so far and no further. Scout's honor. Still, the future significance of today's opinion will be decided in the future. And law often has a way of evolving without regard to original intentions—a way of actually following where logic leads, rather than tolerating hard-to-explain lines. Rights can expand in that way. Dissenting in Lawrence, Justice Scalia explained why he took no comfort in the Court's statement that a decision recognizing the right to same-sex intimacy did not involve same-sex marriage. 539 U.S. at 604, 123 S.Ct. 2472. That could be true, he wrote, only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Id., at 605, 123 S.Ct. 2472. Score one for the dissent, as a matter of prophecy. And logic and principle are not one-way ratchets. Rights can contract in the same way and for the same reason—because whatever today's majority might say, one thing really does lead to another. We fervently hope that does not happen because of today's decision. We hope that we will not join Justice Scalia in the book of prophets. But we cannot understand how anyone can be confident that today's opinion will be the last of its kind.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,540,"Consider, as our last word on this issue, contraception. The Constitution, of course, does not mention that word. And there is no historical right to contraception, of the kind the majority insists on. To the contrary, the American legal landscape in the decades after the Civil War was littered with bans on the sale of contraceptive devices. So again, there seem to be two choices. See supra, at 2242-2243, 2254-2255. If the majority is serious about its historical approach, then Griswold and its progeny are in the line of fire too. Or if it is not serious, then  what is the basis of today's decision? If we had to guess, we suspect the prospects of this Court approving bans on contraception are low. But once again, the future significance of today's opinion will be decided in the future. At the least, today's opinion will fuel the fight to get contraception, and any other issues with a moral dimension, out of the Fourteenth Amendment and into state legislatures.9  Anyway, today's decision, taken on its own, is catastrophic enough. As a matter of constitutional method, the majority's commitment to replicate in 2022 every view about the meaning of liberty held in 1868 has precious little to recommend it. Our law in this constitutional sphere, as in most, has for decades upon decades proceeded differently. It has considered fundamental constitutional principles, the whole course of the Nation's history and traditions, and the step-by-step evolution of the Court's precedents. It is disciplined but not static. It relies on accumulated judgments, not just the sentiments of one long-ago generation of men (who themselves believed, and drafted the Constitution to reflect, that the world progresses). And by doing so, it includes those excluded from that olden conversation, rather than perpetuating its bounds.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,541,"As a matter of constitutional substance, the majority's opinion has all the flaws its method would suggest. Because laws in 1868 deprived women of any control over their bodies, the majority approves States doing so today. Because those laws prevented women from charting the course of their own lives, the majority says States can do the same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell a pregnant woman —even in the first days of her pregnancy —that she could do nothing but bear a child, it can once more impose that command. Today's decision strips women of agency over what even the majority agrees is a contested and contestable moral issue. It forces her to carry out the State's will, whatever the circumstances and whatever the harm it will wreak on her and her family. In the Fourteenth Amendment's terms, it takes away her liberty. Even before we get to stare decisis, we dissent.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,543,"By overruling Roe, Casey, and more than 20 cases reaffirming or applying the constitutional right to abortion, the majority abandons stare decisis, a principle central to the rule of law. Stare decisis means to stand by things decided. Black's Law Dictionary 1696 (11th ed. 2019). Blackstone called it the established rule to abide by former precedents. 1 Blackstone 69. Stare decisis promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles. Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597. It maintains a stability that allows people to order their lives under the law. See H. Hart & A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 568-569 (1994).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,544,"Stare decisis also contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Vasquez, 474 U.S. at 265, 106 S.Ct. 617. As Hamilton wrote: It avoids an arbitrary discretion in the courts. The Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). And as Blackstone said before him: It keeps the scale of justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with every new judge's opinion. 1 Blackstone 69. The glory of our legal system is that it gives preference to precedent rather than  jurists. H. Humble, Departure From Precedent, 19 Mich. L. Rev. 608, 614 (1921). That is why, the story goes, Chief Justice John  Marshall donned a plain black robe when he swore the oath of office. That act personified an American tradition. Judges' personal preferences do not make law, rather, the law speaks through them.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,545,"That means the Court may not overrule a decision, even a constitutional one, without a special justification. Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1960, 1969, 204 L.Ed.2d 322 (2019). Stare decisis is, of course, not an inexorable command, it is sometimes appropriate to overrule an earlier decision. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 233, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). But the Court must have a good reason to do so over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided. Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. 258, 266, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014). It is not alone sufficient that we would decide a case differently now than we did then. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 455, 135 S.Ct. 2401, 192 L.Ed.2d 463 (2015).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,546,"The majority today lists some 30 of our cases as overruling precedent, and argues that they support overruling Roe and Casey. But none does, as further described below and in the Appendix. See infra, at 2350-2354. In some, the Court only partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the rest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare decisis factors in reaching its conclusion. The Court found, for example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision, (2) a factual change that had the same effect, or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The majority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of changed law or fact alone, although that is present in most of the cases. See ante, at 2279.) None of those factors apply here: Nothing—and in particular, no significant legal or factual change—supports overturning a half-century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives. First, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Casey were correct. In holding that a State could not resolve the debate about abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, the Court protected women's liberty and women's equality in a way comporting with our Fourteenth Amendment precedents. Casey, 505 U.S. at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Contrary to the majority's view, the legal status of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those decisions. And the majority's repeated refrain about usurping state legislatures' power to address a publicly contested question does not help it on the key issue here. Ante, at 2265, see ante, at 2240. To repeat: The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 638, 63 S.Ct. 1178, supra, at 2243-2244. However divisive, a right is not at the people's mercy.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,547,"In any event whether or not we  agree with a prior precedent is the beginning, not the end, of our analysis—and the remaining principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling Roe and Casey. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). Casey itself applied those principles, in one of this Court's most important precedents about precedent. After assessing the traditional stare decisis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible—that stare decisis operates powerfully here. It still does. The standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly workable. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two decisions. And tens of millions of American women have  relied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose. So under traditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no special justification for the harm it causes.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,548,"And indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that point. The majority barely mentions any legal or factual changes that have occurred since Roe and Casey. It suggests that the two decisions are hard for courts to implement, but cannot prove its case. In the end, the majority says, all it must say to override stare decisis is one thing: that it believes Roe and Casey egregiously wrong. Ante, at 2279-2280. That rule could equally spell the end of any precedent with which a bare majority of the present Court disagrees. So how does that approach prevent the scale of justice from wavering with every new judge's opinion? 1 Blackstone 69. It does not. It makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them. The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,550,"Contrary to the majority's view, there is nothing unworkable about Casey's undue burden standard. Its primary focus on whether a State has placed a substantial obstacle on a woman seeking an abortion is the sort of inquiry familiar to judges across a variety of contexts. June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2103, 2136, 207 L.Ed.2d 566 (2020) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). And it has given rise to no more conflict in application than many standards this Court and others unhesitatingly apply every day.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,551,"General standards, like the undue burden standard, are ubiquitous in the law, and particularly in constitutional adjudication. When called on to give effect to the Constitution's broad principles, this Court often crafts flexible standards that can be applied case-by-case to a myriad of unforeseeable circumstances. See Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 441, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which it must apply). So, for example, the Court asks about undue or substantial burdens on speech, on voting, and on interstate commerce. See, e.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U.S. 721, 748, 131 S.Ct. 2806, 180 L.Ed.2d 664 (2011), Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433-434, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992), Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). The Casey undue burden standard is the same. It also resembles general standards that courts work with daily in other legal spheres— like the rule of reason in antitrust law or the arbitrary and capricious standard for agency decisionmaking. See Standard Oil Co. of N. J. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 62, 31 S.Ct. 502, 55 L.Ed. 619 (1911), Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42-43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). Applying general standards to particular cases is, in many contexts, just what it means to do law.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,552,"And the undue burden standard has given rise to no unusual difficulties. Of course, it has provoked some disagreement among judges. Casey knew it would: That much is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate life's complexity. 505 U.S. at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). Which is to say: That much is to be expected in the application of any legal standard. But the majority vastly overstates the divisions among judges applying the standard. We  count essentially two. THE CHIEF JUSTICE disagreed with other Justices in the June Medical majority about whether Casey called for weighing the benefits of an abortion regulation against its burdens. See 591 U.S., at ___ _ ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2114-2115, ante, at 2273-2274, 2274, and n. 53.10 We agree that the June Medical difference is a difference—but not one that would actually make a difference in the result of most cases (it did not in June Medical), and not one incapable of resolution were it ever to matter. As for lower courts, there is now a one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit split about how the undue burden standard applies to state laws that ban abortions for certain reasons, like fetal abnormality. See ante, at 2274, and n. 57. That is about it, as far as we can see.11 And that is not much. This Court mostly does not even grant certiorari on one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit splits, because we know that a bit of disagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system. To borrow an old saying that might apply here: Not one or even a couple of swallows can make the majority's summer.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,553,"Anyone concerned about workability should consider the majority's substitute standard. The majority says a law regulating or banning abortion must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Ante, at 2284. And the majority lists interests like respect for and preservation of prenatal life, protection of maternal health, elimination of certain medical procedures, mitigation of fetal pain, and others. Ante, at 2284. This Court will surely face critical questions about how that test applies. Must a state law allow abortions when necessary to protect a woman's life and health? And if so, exactly when? How much risk to a woman's life can a State force her to incur, before the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of life kicks in? Suppose a patient with pulmonary hypertension has a 30-to-50 percent risk of dying with ongoing pregnancy, is that enough? And short of death, how much illness or injury can the State require her to accept, consistent with the Amendment's protection of liberty and  equality? Further, the Court may face questions about the application of abortion regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation or medication for miscarriage management? See generally L. Harris, Navigating Loss of Abortion Services—A Large Academic Medical Center Prepares for the Overturn of Roe v. Wade, 386 New England J. Med. 2061 (2022).12",Breyer,0,
2021-019,554,"Finally, the majority's ruling today invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts. See supra, at 2318, see generally D. Cohen, G. Donley, & R. Rebouché, The New Abortion Battleground, 123 Colum. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2023), https://ssrn.com/abstract=4032931. Can a State bar women from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? Can a State prohibit advertising out-of-state abortions or helping women get to out-of-state providers? Can a State interfere with the mailing of drugs used for medication abortions? The Constitution protects travel and speech and interstate commerce, so today's ruling will give rise to a host of new constitutional questions. Far from removing the Court from the abortion issue, the majority puts the Court at the center of the coming interjurisdictional abortion wars. Id., at ___ (draft, at 1).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,555,"In short, the majority does not save judges from unwieldy tests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy. To the contrary, it discards a known, workable, and predictable standard in favor of something novel and probably far more complicated. It forces the Court to wade further into hotly contested issues, including moral and philosophical ones, that the majority criticizes Roe and Casey for addressing.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,557,"When overruling constitutional precedent, the Court has almost always pointed to major legal or factual changes undermining a decision's original basis. A review of the Appendix to this dissent proves the point. See infra, at 2350-2354. Most successful proponents of overruling precedent, this Court once said, have carried the heavy burden of persuading the Court that changes in society or in the law dictate that the values served by stare decisis yield in favor of a greater objective. Vasquez, 474 U.S. at 266, 106 S.Ct. 617. Certainly, that was so of the main examples the majority cites: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 578, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937). But it is not so today. Although nodding to some arguments others have made about modern developments, the majority does not really rely on them, no doubt seeing their slimness. Ante, at 2258-2259, see ante, at 2259. The majority briefly invokes the current controversy over abortion. See ante, at 2279-2281. But it has to acknowledge that the same dispute has existed for decades: Conflict  over abortion is not a change but a constant. (And as we will later discuss, the presence of that continuing division provides more of a reason to stick with, than to jettison, existing precedent. See infra, at 2347-2349.) In the end, the majority throws longstanding precedent to the winds without showing that anything significant has changed to justify its radical reshaping of the law. See ante, at 2264-2265.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,559,"Subsequent legal developments have only reinforced Roe and Casey. The Court has continued to embrace all the decisions Roe and Casey cited, decisions which recognize a constitutional right for an individual to make her own choices about intimate relationships, the family, and contraception. Casey, 505 U.S. at 857, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Roe and Casey have themselves formed the legal foundation for subsequent decisions protecting these profoundly personal choices. As discussed earlier, the Court relied on Casey to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects same-sex intimate relationships. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472, supra, at 2329-2330. The Court later invoked the same set of precedents to accord constitutional recognition to same-sex marriage. See Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 665-666, 135 S.Ct. 2584, supra, at 2329-2330. In sum, Roe and Casey are inextricably interwoven with decades of precedent about the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra, at 2328-2330. While the majority might wish it otherwise, Roe and Casey are the very opposite of `obsolete constitutional thinking.' Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 236, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 857, 112 S.Ct. 2791).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,560,"Moreover, no subsequent factual developments have undermined Roe and Casey. Women continue to experience unplanned pregnancies and unexpected developments in pregnancies. Pregnancies continue to have enormous physical, social, and economic consequences. Even an uncomplicated pregnancy imposes significant strain on the body, unavoidably involving significant physiological change and excruciating pain. For some women, pregnancy and childbirth can mean life-altering physical ailments or even death. Today, as noted earlier, the risks of carrying a pregnancy to term dwarf those of having an abortion. See supra, at 2328-2329. Experts estimate that a ban on abortions increases maternal mortality by 21 percent, with white women facing a 13 percent increase in maternal mortality while black women face a 33 percent increase.13 Pregnancy and childbirth may also impose large-scale financial costs. The majority briefly refers to arguments about changes in laws relating to healthcare coverage, pregnancy discrimination, and family leave. See ante, at 2258-2259. Many women, however, still do not have adequate healthcare coverage before and after pregnancy, and, even when insurance coverage is available, healthcare services may be far away.14  Women also continue to face pregnancy discrimination that interferes with their ability to earn a living. Paid family leave remains inaccessible to many who need it most. Only 20 percent of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave, including a mere 8 percent of workers in the bottom quartile of wage earners.15",Breyer,0,
2021-019,561,"The majority briefly notes the growing prevalence of safe haven laws and demand for adoption, see ante, at 2259, and nn. 45-46, but, to the degree that these are changes at all, they too are irrelevant.16 Neither reduces the health risks or financial costs of going through pregnancy and childbirth. Moreover, the choice to give up parental rights after giving birth is altogether different from the choice not to carry a pregnancy to term. The reality is that few women denied an abortion will choose adoption.17 The vast majority will continue, just as in Roe and Casey's time, to shoulder the costs of childrearing. Whether or not they choose to parent, they will experience the profound loss of autonomy and dignity that coerced pregnancy and birth always impose.18",Breyer,0,
2021-019,562,"Mississippi's own record illustrates how little facts on the ground have changed since Roe and Casey, notwithstanding the majority's supposed modern developments. Ante, at 2258-2259. Sixty-two percent of pregnancies in Mississippi are unplanned, yet Mississippi does not require insurance to cover contraceptives and prohibits educators from demonstrating proper contraceptive use.19 The State  neither bans pregnancy discrimination nor requires provision of paid parental leave. Brief for Yale Law School Information Society Project as Amicus Curiae 13 (Brief for Yale Law School), Brief for National Women's Law Center et al. as Amici Curiae 32. It has strict eligibility requirements for Medicaid and nutrition assistance, leaving many women and families without basic medical care or enough food. See Brief for 547 Deans, Chairs, Scholars and Public Health Professionals et al. as Amici Curiae 32-34 (Brief for 547 Deans). Although 86 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the State are due to postpartum complications, Mississippi rejected federal funding to provide a year's worth of Medicaid coverage to women after giving birth. See Brief for Yale Law School 12-13. Perhaps unsurprisingly, health outcomes in Mississippi are abysmal for both women and children. Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the country, and some of the highest rates for preterm birth, low birthweight, cesarean section, and maternal death.20 It is approximately 75 times more dangerous for a woman in the State to carry a pregnancy to term than to have an abortion. See Brief for 547 Deans 9-10. We do not say that every State is Mississippi, and we are sure some have made gains since Roe and Casey in providing support for women and children. But a state-by-state analysis by public health professionals shows that States with the most restrictive abortion policies also continue to invest the least in women's and children's health. See Brief for 547 Deans 23-34.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,563,"The only notable change we can see since Roe and Casey cuts in favor of adhering to precedent: It is that American abortion law has become more and more aligned with other nations. The majority, like the Mississippi Legislature, claims that the United States is an extreme outlier when it comes to abortion regulation. See ante, at 2243, and n. 15. The global trend, however, has been toward increased provision of legal and safe abortion care. A number of countries, including New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Iceland, permit abortions up to a roughly similar time as Roe and Casey set. See Brief for International and Comparative Legal Scholars as Amici Curiae 18-22. Canada has decriminalized abortion at any point in a pregnancy. See id., at 13-15. Most Western European countries impose restrictions on abortion after 12 to 14 weeks, but they often have liberal exceptions to those time limits, including to prevent harm to a woman's physical or mental health. See id., at 24-27, Brief for European Law Professors as Amici Curiae 16-17, Appendix. They also typically make access to early abortion easier, for example, by helping cover its cost.21 Perhaps most notable,  more than 50 countries around the world—in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe—have expanded access to abortion in the past 25 years. See Brief for International and Comparative Legal Scholars as Amici Curiae 28-29. In light of that worldwide liberalization of abortion laws, it is American States that will become international outliers after today.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,564,"In sum, the majority can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. Nothing that has happened in this country or the world in recent decades undermines the core insight of Roe and Casey. It continues to be true that, within the constraints those decisions established, a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,566,"In support of its holding, see ante, at 2262-2263, the majority invokes two watershed cases overruling prior constitutional precedents: West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Education. But those decisions, unlike today's, responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. As Casey recognized, the two cases are relevant only to show— by stark contrast—how unjustified overturning the right to choose is. See 505 U.S. at 861-864, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,567,"West Coast Hotel overruled Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., 261 U.S. 525, 43 S.Ct. 394, 67 L.Ed. 785 (1923), and a whole line of cases beginning with Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905). Adkins had found a state minimum-wage law unconstitutional because, in the Court's view, the law interfered with a constitutional right to contract. 261 U.S. at 554-555, 43 S.Ct. 394. But then the Great Depression hit, bringing with it unparalleled economic despair. The experience undermined—in fact, it disproved—Adkins's assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs. As Justice Jackson (before becoming a Justice) wrote of that time: The older world of laissez faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead. The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). In West Coast Hotel, the Court caught up, recognizing through the lens of experience the flaws of existing legal doctrine. See also ante, at 2316 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). The havoc the Depression had worked on ordinary Americans, the Court noted, was common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land. 300 U.S. at 399, 57 S.Ct. 578. The laissez-faire approach had led to the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living. Ibid. And since Adkins was decided, the law had also changed. In several decisions, the Court had started to recognize the power of States to implement economic policies designed to enhance their citizens' economic well-being. See, e.g., Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 54 S.Ct. 505, 78 L.Ed. 940 (1934), O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U.S. 251, 51 S.Ct. 130, 75 L.Ed. 324 (1931). The statements in those decisions, West Coast Hotel explained, were impossible to reconcile with Adkins. 300 U.S. at 398, 57 S.Ct. 578. There was no escaping the need for Adkins to go.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,568,"Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), along with its doctrine of separate but equal. By 1954, decades of Jim Crow had made clear what Plessy's turn of phrase actually meant: inherent inequality. Brown, 347 U.S. at 495, 74 S.Ct. 686. Segregation was not, and could not ever be, consistent with  the Reconstruction Amendments, ratified to give the former slaves full citizenship. Whatever might have been thought in Plessy's time, the Brown Court explained, both experience and modern authority showed the detrimental effects of state-sanctioned segregation: It affected children's hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. 686. By that point, too, the law had begun to reflect that understanding. In a series of decisions, the Court had held unconstitutional public graduate schools' exclusion of black students. See, e.g., Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114 (1950), Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 332 U.S. 631, 68 S.Ct. 299, 92 L.Ed. 247 (1948) (per curiam), Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337, 59 S.Ct. 232, 83 L.Ed. 208 (1938). The logic of those cases, Brown held, applied with added force to children in grade and high schools. 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. 686. Changed facts and changed law required Plessy's end.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,569,"The majority says that in recognizing those changes, we are implicitly supporting the half-century interlude between Plessy and Brown. See ante, at 2279-2280. That is not so. First, if the Brown Court had used the majority's method of constitutional construction, it might not ever have overruled Plessy, whether 5 or 50 or 500 years later. Brown thought that whether the ratification-era history supported desegregation was at best  inconclusive. 347 U.S. at 489, 74 S.Ct. 686. But even setting that aside, we are not saying that a decision can never be overruled just because it is terribly wrong. Take West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628, which the majority also relies on. See ante, at 2262-2264, 2279-2280. That overruling took place just three years after the initial decision, before any notable reliance interests had developed. It happened as well because individual Justices changed their minds, not because a new majority wanted to undo the decisions of their predecessors. Both Barnette and Brown, moreover, share another feature setting them apart from the Court's ruling today. They protected individual rights with a strong basis in the Constitution's most fundamental commitments, they did not, as the majority does here, take away a right that individuals have held, and relied on, for 50 years. To take that action based on a new and bare majority's declaration that two Courts got the result egregiously wrong? And to justify that action by reference to Barnette? Or to Brown—a case in which the Chief Justice also wrote an (11-page) opinion in which the entire Court could speak with one voice? These questions answer themselves.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,570,"Casey itself addressed both West Coast Hotel and Brown, and found that neither supported Roe's overruling. In West Coast Hotel, Casey explained, the facts of economic life had proved different from those previously assumed. 505 U.S. at 862, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And even though Plessy was wrong the day it was decided, the passage of time had made that ever more clear to ever more citizens: Society's understanding of the facts in 1954 was fundamentally different than in 1896. Id., at 863, 112 S.Ct. 2791. So the Court needed to reverse course. In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed circumstances may impose new obligations. Id., at 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And because such dramatic change had occurred, the public could understand why the Court was acting. The Nation could accept each decision as a response to the Court's constitutional duty. Ibid. But that would not be true of a reversal of Roe— because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor our understanding of it has changed. 505 U.S. at 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,571,"That is just as much so today, because Roe and Casey continue to reflect, not diverge from, broad trends in American society. It is, of course, true that many Americans, including many women, opposed those decisions when issued and do so now as well. Yet the fact remains: Roe and Casey were the product of a profound and ongoing change in women's roles in the latter part of the 20th century. Only a dozen years before Roe, the Court described women as the center of home and family life, with special responsibilities that precluded their full legal status under the Constitution. Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 62, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961). By 1973, when the Court decided Roe, fundamental social change was underway regarding the place of women—and the law had begun to follow. See Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971) (recognizing that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex-based discrimination). By 1992, when the Court decided Casey, the traditional view of a woman's role as only a wife and mother was no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution. 505 U.S. at 897, 112 S.Ct. 2791, see supra, at 2324-2325, 2329-2330. Under that charter, Casey understood, women must take their place as full and equal citizens. And for that to happen, women must have control over their reproductive decisions. Nothing since Casey—no changed law, no changed fact—has undermined that promise.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,573,"The reasons for retaining Roe and Casey gain further strength from the overwhelming reliance interests those decisions have created. The Court adheres to precedent not just for institutional reasons, but because it recognizes that stability in the law is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual. Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U.S. 147, 154, 101 S.Ct. 1032, 67 L.Ed.2d 132 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring). So when overruling precedent would dislodge individuals' settled rights and expectations, stare decisis has added force. Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991). Casey understood that to deny individuals' reliance on Roe was to refuse to face the facts. 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Today the majority refuses to face the facts. The most striking feature of the majority is the absence of any serious discussion of how its ruling will affect women. Ante, at 2261. By characterizing Casey's reliance arguments as generalized assertions about the national psyche, ante, at 2276, it reveals how little it knows or cares about women's lives or about the suffering its decision will cause.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,574,"In Casey, the Court observed that for two decades individuals have organized intimate relationships and made significant life choices in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Over another 30 years, that reliance has solidified. For half a century now, in Casey's words, the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid., see supra, at 2330. Indeed, all women now of childbearing age have grown up expecting that they would be able to avail themselves of Roe's and Casey's protections.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,575,"The disruption of overturning Roe and Caseywill therefore be profound. Abortion is a common medical procedure and a familiar experience in women's lives. About 18 percent of pregnancies in this country end in abortion, and about one quarter of  American women will have an abortion before the age of 45.22 Those numbers reflect the predictable and life-changing effects of carrying a pregnancy, giving birth, and becoming a parent. As Casey understood, people today rely on their ability to control and time pregnancies when making countless life decisions: where to live, whether and how to invest in education or careers, how to allocate financial resources, and how to approach intimate and family relationships. Women may count on abortion access for when contraception fails. They may count on abortion access for when contraception cannot be used, for example, if they were raped. They may count on abortion for when something changes in the midst of a pregnancy, whether it involves family or financial circumstances, unanticipated medical complications, or heartbreaking fetal diagnoses. Taking away the right to abortion, as the majority does today, destroys all those individual plans and expectations. In so doing, it diminishes women's opportunities to participate fully and equally in the Nation's political, social, and economic life. See Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae 13 (showing that abortion availability has large effects on women's education, labor force participation, occupations, and earnings (footnotes omitted)).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,576,"The majority's response to these obvious points exists far from the reality American women actually live. The majority proclaims that `reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.' Ante, at 2276 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791).23 The facts are: 45 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. See Brief for 547 Deans 5. Even the most effective contraceptives fail, and effective contraceptives are not universally accessible.24 Not all sexual activity is consensual and not all contraceptive choices are made by the party who risks pregnancy. See Brief for Legal Voice et al. as Amici Curiae 18-19. The Mississippi law at issue here, for example, has no exception for rape or incest, even for underage women. Finally, the majority ignores, as explained above, that some women decide to have an abortion because their circumstances change during a pregnancy. See supra, at 2344. Human bodies care little for hopes and plans. Events can occur after conception, from unexpected medical risks to changes in family circumstances, which profoundly alter what it means to carry a pregnancy to term. In all these situations, women have expected that they will get to decide, perhaps in consultation with their families or doctors but free from state interference, whether to continue a pregnancy. For those who will now have to undergo that pregnancy, the loss of Roe and Casey could be disastrous.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,577,"That is especially so for women without money. When we count the cost of Roe's repudiation on women who once relied on that decision, it is not hard to see  where the greatest burden will fall. Casey, 505 U.S. at 855, 112 S.Ct. 2791. In States that bar abortion, women of means will still be able to travel to obtain the services they need.25 It is women who cannot afford to do so who will suffer most. These are the women most likely to seek abortion care in the first place. Women living below the federal poverty line experience unintended pregnancies at rates five times higher than higher income women do, and nearly half of women who seek abortion care live in households below the poverty line. See Brief for 547 Deans 7, Brief for Abortion Funds and Practical Support Organizations as Amici Curiae 8 (Brief for Abortion Funds). Even with Roe's protection, these women face immense obstacles to raising the money needed to obtain abortion care early in their pregnancy. See Brief for Abortion Funds 7-12.26 After today, in States where legal abortions are not available, they will lose any ability to obtain safe, legal abortion care. They will not have the money to make the trip necessary, or to obtain childcare for that time, or to take time off work. Many will endure the costs and risks of pregnancy and giving birth against their wishes. Others will turn in desperation to illegal and unsafe abortions. They may lose not just their freedom, but their lives.27",Breyer,0,
2021-019,578,"Finally, the expectation of reproductive control is integral to many women's identity and their place in the Nation. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. That expectation helps define a woman as an equal citizen, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that status entails. Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 172, 127 S.Ct. 1610 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), see supra, at 2329-2330. It reflects that she is an autonomous person, and that society and the law recognize her as such. Like many constitutional rights, the right to choose situates a woman in relationship to others and to the government. It helps define a  sphere of freedom, in which a person has the capacity to make choices free of government control. As Casey recognized, the right orders her thinking as well as her living. 505 U.S. at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Beyond any individual choice about residence, or education, or career, her whole life reflects the control and authority that the right grants.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,579,"Withdrawing a woman's right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy does not mean that no choice is being made. It means that a majority of today's Court has wrenched this choice from women and given it to the States. To allow a State to exert control over one of the most intimate and personal choices a woman may make is not only to affect the course of her life, monumental as those effects might be. Id., at 851, 112 S.Ct. 2791. It is to alter her views of herself and her understanding of her place in society as someone with the recognized dignity and authority to make these choices. Id., at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Women have relied on Roe and Casey in this way for 50 years. Many have never known anything else. When Roe and Casey disappear, the loss of power, control, and dignity will be immense.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,580,"The Court's failure to perceive the whole swath of expectations Roe and Casey created reflects an impoverished view of reliance. According to the majority, a reliance interest must be very concrete, like those involving property or contract. Ante, at 2276. While many of this Court's cases addressing reliance have been in the commercial context, Casey, 505 U.S. at 855, 112 S.Ct. 2791, none holds that interests must be analogous to commercial ones to warrant stare decisis protection.28 This unprecedented assertion is, at bottom, a radical claim to power. By disclaiming any need to consider broad swaths of individuals' interests, the Court arrogates to itself the authority to overrule established legal principles without even acknowledging the costs of its decisions for the individuals who live under the law, costs that this Court's stare decisis doctrine instructs us to privilege when deciding whether to change course.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,581,"The majority claims that the reliance interests women have in Roe and Casey are too intangible for the Court to consider, even if it were inclined to do so. Ante, at 2277-2278. This is to ignore as judges what we know as men and women. The interests women have in Roe and Casey are perfectly, viscerally concrete. Countless women will now make different decisions about careers, education, relationships, and whether to try to become pregnant than they would have when Roe served as a backstop. Other women will carry pregnancies to term, with all the costs and risk of harm that involves, when they would previously have chosen to obtain an abortion. For millions of women, Roe and Casey have been critical in giving them control of their bodies and their lives. Closing our eyes to the suffering today's decision will impose will not make that suffering disappear. The majority cannot escape its obligation to count the costs of its decision by invoking the conflicting arguments of contending sides. Casey, 505 U.S. at 855, 112 S.Ct.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,582,"2791, ante, at 2277-2278. Stare decisis requires that the Court calculate the costs of a decision's repudiation on those who have relied on the decision, not on those who have disavowed it. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 855, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,583,"More broadly, the majority's approach to reliance cannot be reconciled with our Nation's understanding of constitutional rights. The majority's insistence on a concrete, economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights—such as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to marry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the majority's logic, could transfer those choices to the State without having to consider a person's settled understanding that the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All those rights, like the right to obtain an abortion, profoundly affect and, indeed, anchor individual lives. To recognize that people have relied on these rights is not to dabble in abstractions, but to acknowledge some of the most concrete and familiar aspects of human life and liberty. Ante, at 2276.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,584,"All those rights, like the one here, also have a societal dimension, because of the role constitutional liberties play in our structure of government. See, e.g., Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (recognizing that Miranda warnings have become part of our national culture in declining to overrule Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)). Rescinding an individual right in its entirety and conferring it on the State, an action the Court takes today for the first time in history, affects all who have relied on our constitutional system of government and its structure of individual liberties protected from state oversight. Roe and Casey have of course aroused controversy and provoked disagreement. But the right those decisions conferred and reaffirmed is part of society's understanding of constitutional law and of how the Court has defined the liberty and equality that women are entitled to claim.",Breyer,0,

The majority accomplishes that result without so much as considering how women have relied on the right to choose or what it means to take that right away. The majority's refusal even to consider the life-altering consequences of reversing Roe and Casey is a stunning indictment of its decision.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,587,"One last consideration counsels against the majority's ruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey. The majority accuses Casey of acting outside the bounds of the law to quell the conflict over abortion —of imposing an unprincipled settlement of the issue in an effort to end national division. Ante, at 2278. But that is not what Casey did. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles of stare decisis—which the majority today ignores—in reaffirming Roe. Casey carefully assessed changed circumstances (none) and reliance interests (profound). It considered every aspect of how Roe's framework operated. It adhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the conclusion that the law required. True enough that Casey took notice of the national controversy about abortion: The Court knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a divisive issue. Casey, 505 U.S. at 867-868, 112 S.Ct. 2791, see Roe, 410 U.S. at 116, 93 S.Ct. 705. But Casey's reason for acknowledging public conflict was the exact opposite of what the majority insinuates. Casey addressed the national controversy in order to emphasize how important it was, in that case of all cases,  for the Court to stick to the law. Would that today's majority had done likewise.",Breyer,0,

2021-019,589,"The American people's belief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an institution that decides important cases based on principle, not `social and political pressures.' There is a special danger that the public will perceive a decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the Court overrules a controversial `watershed' decision, such as Roe. A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made `under fire' and as a `surrender to political pressure.' Ante, at 2278 (citations omitted).",Breyer,0,
2021-019,590,"That seems to us a good description. And it seems to us right. The majority responds (if we understand it correctly): well, yes, but we have to apply the law. See ante, at 2278. To which Casey would have said: That is exactly the point. Here, more than anywhere, the Court needs to apply the law—particularly the law of stare decisis. Here, we know that citizens will continue to contest the Court's decision, because men and women of good conscience deeply disagree about abortion. Casey, 505 U.S. at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791. When that contestation takes place— but when there is no legal basis for reversing course—the Court needs to be steadfast, to stand its ground. That is what the rule of law requires. And that is what respect for this Court depends on.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,591,"The promise of constancy, once given in so charged an environment, Casey explained, binds its maker for as long as the understanding of the issue has not changed so fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. Id., at 868, 112 S.Ct. 2791. A breach of that promise is nothing less than a breach of faith. Ibid. And no Court that broke its faith with the people could sensibly expect credit for principle. Ibid. No Court breaking its faith in that way would deserve credit for principle. As one of Casey's authors wrote in another case, Our legitimacy requires, above all, that we adhere to stare decisis in sensitive political contexts where partisan controversy abounds. Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 985, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 135 L.Ed.2d 248 (1996) (opinion of O'Connor, J.).",Breyer,0,

United States, 323 U.S. 214, 246, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944). We fear that today's decision, departing from stare decisis for no legitimate reason, is its own loaded weapon. Weakening stare decisis threatens to upend bedrock legal doctrines, far beyond any single decision. Weakening stare decisis creates profound legal instability. And as Casey recognized, weakening stare decisis in a hotly contested case like this one calls into question this Court's commitment to legal principle. It makes the Court appear not restrained but aggressive, not modest but grasping. In all those ways, today's decision takes aim, we fear, at the rule of law.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,594,"Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Court's decisionmaking. Payne, 501 U.S. at 844, 111 S.Ct. 2597 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Roe has stood for fifty years. Casey, a precedent about precedent specifically confirming Roe, has stood for thirty. And the doctrine of stare decisis—a critical element of the rule of law—stands foursquare behind their continued existence. The right those decisions established and preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both originating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily  integrity, personal autonomy, and family relationships. The abortion right is also embedded in the lives of women—shaping their expectations, influencing their choices about relationships and work, supporting (as all reproductive rights do) their social and economic equality. Since the right's recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed to support what the majority does today. Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have provided any new reasons to reach a different result than Roe and Casey did. All that has changed is this Court.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,595,"Mississippi—and other States too— knew exactly what they were doing in ginning up new legal challenges to Roe and Casey. The 15-week ban at issue here was enacted in 2018. Other States quickly followed: Between 2019 and 2021, eight States banned abortion procedures after six to eight weeks of pregnancy, and three States enacted all-out bans.29 Mississippi itself decided in 2019 that it had not gone far enough: The year after enacting the law under review, the State passed a 6-week restriction. A state senator who championed both Mississippi laws said the obvious out loud. A lot of people thought, he explained, that finally, we have a conservative Court and so now would be a good time to start testing the limits of Roe.30 In its petition for certiorari, the State had exercised a smidgen of restraint. It had urged the Court merely to roll back Roe and Casey, specifically assuring the Court that the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn those precedents. Pet. for Cert. 5, see ante, at 2313 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). But as Mississippi grew ever more confident in its prospects, it resolved to go all in. It urged the Court to overrule Roe and Casey. Nothing but everything would be enough.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,596,"Earlier this Term, this Court signaled that Mississippi's stratagem would succeed. Texas was one of the fistful of States to have recently banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It added to that flagrantly unconstitutional restriction an unprecedented scheme to evade judicial scrutiny. Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson, 594 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2494, 2498, 210 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2021) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). And five Justices acceded to that cynical maneuver. They let Texas defy this Court's constitutional rulings, nullifying Roe and Casey ahead of schedule in the Nation's second largest State.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,597,"And now the other shoe drops, courtesy of that same five-person majority. (We believe that THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion is wrong too, but no one should think that there is not a large difference between upholding a 15-week ban on the  grounds he does and allowing States to prohibit abortion from the time of conception.) Now a new and bare majority of this Court—acting at practically the first moment possible—overrules Roe and Casey. It converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Casey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion bans. See ante, at 2272-2273, 2273-2274, 2275-2276, and nn. 61-64 (relying on former dissents). It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women's freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court's legitimacy.",Breyer,0,
2021-019,598,"Casey itself made the last point in explaining why it would not overrule Roe— though some members of its majority might not have joined Roe in the first instance. Just as we did here, Casey explained the importance of stare decisis, the inappositeness of West Coast Hotel and Brown, the absence of any changed circumstances (or other reason) justifying the reversal of precedent. 505 U.S. at 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791, see supra, at 2333-2335, 2337-2343. The Court, Casey explained, could not pretend that overruling Roe had any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. 505 U.S. at 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791. And to overrule for that reason? Quoting Justice Stewart, Casey explained that to do so—to reverse prior law upon a ground no firmer than a change in the Court's membership —would invite the view that this institution is little different from the two political branches of the Government. Ibid. No view, Casey thought, could do more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding mission to serve. Ibid. For overruling Roe, Casey concluded, the Court would pay a terrible price. 505 U.S. at 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791.",Breyer,0,

Id., at 864, 112 S.Ct. 2791. It is hard—no, it is impossible—to conclude that anything else has happened here. One of us once said that it is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much. S. Breyer, Breaking the Promise of Brown: The Resegregation of America's Schools 30 (2022).

This fiduciary duty of prudence governs the conduct of respondents, who administer several retirement plans on behalf of current and former employees of Northwestern University, including petitioners.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-020,23,"In this case, petitioners claim that respondents violated their duty of prudence  by, among other things, offering needlessly expensive investment options and paying excessive recordkeeping fees. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that petitioners' allegations fail as a matter of law, in part based on the court's determination that petitioners' preferred type of low-cost investments were available as plan options.

Both Plans are defined-contribution plans. In such plans, participating employees maintain individual investment accounts, which are funded by pretax contributions from the employees' salaries and, where applicable, matching contributions from the employer. Each participant chooses how to invest her funds, subject to an important limitation: She may choose only from the menu of options selected by the plan administrators, i.e., respondents. The performance of her chosen investments, as well as the deduction of any associated fees, determines the amount of money the participant will have saved for retirement.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-020,28,"Two types of fees are relevant in this case. First, the investment options typically offered in retirement plans, such as mutual funds and index funds, often charge a fee for investment management services. Such fees compensate a fund for designing and maintaining the fund's investment portfolio. These fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the assets the plan participant chooses to invest in the fund, which is known as the expense ratio. Expense ratios tend to be higher for funds that are actively managed according to the funds' investment strategies, and lower for funds that passively track the makeup of a standardized index, such as the S&P 500.",Sotomayor,0,

Like petitioners, the plaintiffs in Tibble alleged that their plan fiduciaries had offered higher priced retail-class mutual funds as Plan investments when materially identical lower priced institutional-class mutual funds were available. Id., at 525-526, 135 S.Ct. 1823. Three of the higher priced investments, however, had been added to the plan out-side of the 6-year statute of limitations. Id., at 526, 135 S.Ct. 1823. This Court addressed whether the plaintiffs nevertheless had identified a potential violation with respect to these funds. The Court concluded that they had because a fiduciary is required to conduct a regular review of its investment. Id., at 528, 135 S.Ct. 1823. Thus, a plaintiff may allege that a fiduciary breached the duty of prudence by failing to properly monitor investments and remove imprudent ones. Id., at 530, 135 S.Ct. 1823.

As a result, respondents allegedly failed to remove imprudent investments from the Plans' offerings. These allegations must be considered in light of the principles set forth in Tibble to determine whether petitioners have stated a plausible claim for relief.",Sotomayor,0,

Instead, the Seventh Circuit focused on another component of the duty of prudence: a fiduciary's obligation to assemble  a diverse menu of options. The court determined that respondents had provided an adequate array of choices, including the types of funds plaintiffs wanted (low-cost index funds). 953 F.3d at 991. In the court's view, these offerings eliminated any claim that plan participants were forced to stomach an unappetizing menu. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-020,37,"The Seventh Circuit erred in relying on the participants' ultimate choice over their investments to excuse allegedly imprudent decisions by respondents. In Tibble, this Court explained that, even in a defined-contribution plan where participants choose their investments, plan fiduciaries are required to conduct their own independent evaluation to determine which investments may be prudently included in the plan's menu of options. See 575 U.S., at 529-530, 135 S.Ct. 1823. If the fiduciaries fail to remove an imprudent investment from the plan within a reasonable time, they breach their duty. See ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-020,38,"The Seventh Circuit's exclusive focus on investor choice elided this aspect of the duty of prudence. For instance, the court rejected petitioners' allegations that respondents offered investment options that were too numerous, too expensive, or underperforming on the same ground: that petitioners failed to allege  that Northwestern did not make their preferred offerings available to them, and simply objected that numerous additional funds were offered as well. 953 F.3d at 991. In the court's view, because petitioners' preferred type of investments were available, they could not complain about the flaws in other options. See ibid. The same was true for recordkeeping fees: The court noted that plan participants had options to keep the expense ratios (and, therefore, recordkeeping expenses) low. Id., at 991, n. 10.

Finally, the Affordable Care Act outlaws discrimination on any of the preceding grounds, in addition to age, by healthcare entities receiving federal funds. 42 U.S.C. § 18116.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,40,"None of these statutes expressly provides victims of discrimination a private right of action to sue the funding recipient in federal court.

2021-021,41,"Although it is beyond dispute that private individuals may sue to enforce the  antidiscrimination statutes we consider here, it is less clear what remedies are available in such a suit. Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185, 122 S.Ct. 2097. In Franklin, we considered whether monetary damages are available as a remedy for intentional violations of Title IX (and, by extension, the other statutes we discussed). 503 U.S. at 76, 112 S.Ct. 1028. We answered yes, ibid., but did not describe the scope of `appropriate relief.' Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185, 122 S.Ct. 2097.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,42,"Our later cases have filled in that gap, clarifying that our consideration of whether a remedy qualifies as appropriate relief must be informed by the way Spending Clause statutes operate: by conditioning an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate, in what amounts essentially to a contract between the Government and the recipient of funds. Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 286, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998). Unlike ordinary legislation, which imposes congressional policy on regulated parties involuntarily, Spending Clause legislation operates based on consent: in return for federal funds, the recipients agree to comply with federally imposed conditions. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 16, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531. For that reason, the legitimacy of Congress' power to enact Spending Clause legislation rests not on its sovereign authority to enact binding laws, but on whether the recipient voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of that `contract.' Barnes, 536 U.S. at 186, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,43,"We have regularly applied this contract-law analogy in cases defining the scope of conduct for which funding recipients may be held liable for money damages. Barnes, 536 U.S. at 186, 122 S.Ct. 2097. Recipients cannot knowingly accept the deal with the Federal Government unless they would clearly understand the obligations that would come along with doing so. Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006). We therefore construe the reach of Spending Clause conditions with an eye toward ensuring that the receiving entity of federal funds had notice that it will be liable. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287, 118 S.Ct. 1989 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,44,"The same analogy, Barnes, 536 U.S. at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097, similarly limits the scope of available remedies in actions brought to enforce Spending Clause statutes, Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287, 118 S.Ct. 1989. After all, when considering whether to accept federal funds, a prospective recipient would surely wonder not only what rules it must follow, but also what sort of penalties might be on the table. See Barnes, 536 U.S. at 188, 122 S.Ct. 2097. A particular remedy is thus appropriate relief in a private Spending Clause action only if the funding recipient is on notice that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature. Id., at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (emphasis in original). Only then can we be confident that the recipient exercised its choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of its participation in the federal program. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,46,"In order to decide whether emotional distress damages are available under the Spending Clause statutes we consider here, we therefore ask a simple question: Would a prospective funding recipient, at the time it engaged in the  process of deciding whether to accept federal dollars, have been aware that it would face such liability? Arlington, 548 U.S. at 296, 126 S.Ct. 2455. If yes, then emotional distress damages are available, if no, they are not.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,47,"Because the statutes at issue are silent as to available remedies, it is not obvious how to decide whether funding recipients would have had the requisite clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case. Ibid. We confronted that same dynamic in Barnes. There, we considered whether a federal funding recipient would have known, when taking the money, that it was agreeing to face punitive damages in suits brought under those laws. We noted that the statutory text contains no express remedies. 536 U.S. at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097. But we explained that, following the contract analogy set out in our Spending Clause cases, a federal funding recipient may be considered on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract. Ibid. We identified two such remedies: compensatory damages and injunctions. By contrast, we explained, punitive damages are generally not available for breach of contract. Ibid. We thus concluded that funding recipients covered by the statutes at issue have not, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages. Id., at 188, 122 S.Ct. 2097.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,48,"Crucial for this case, we considered punitive damages to be generally not available for breach of contract, see id., at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097, despite the fact that such damages are hardly unheard of in contract cases. Indeed, according to the treatises we cited, punitive damages are recoverable in contract where the conduct constituting the breach is also a tort for which punitive damages are recoverable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 355, p. 154 (1979), see also 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts § 12.8, pp. 192-201 (2d ed. 1998). That recognized exception to the general rule, however, was not enough to give funding recipients the requisite notice that they could face such damages.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,49,"Under Barnes, then, we may presume that a funding recipient is aware that, for breaching its Spending Clause contract with the Federal Government, it will be subject to the usual contract remedies in private suits. That is apparent from the adverbs Barnes repeatedly used, requiring that a remedy be traditionally available, generally  available, or normally available for contract actions. 536 U.S. at 187-188, 122 S.Ct. 2097. And it is confirmed by the Court's holding: that punitive damages are unavailable in private actions brought under these statutes even though such damages are a familiar feature of contract law.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,51,"Under the framework just set out, the analysis here is straightforward. It is hornbook law that emotional distress is generally not compensable in contract, D. Laycock & R. Hasen, Modern American Remedies 216 (5th ed. 2019), just as punitive damages  are generally not available for breach of contract, Barnes, 536 U.S. at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097. See 11 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts § 1341, p. 214 (3d ed. 1968) (Mental suffering caused by breach of contract, although it may be a real injury, is not generally allowed as a basis for compensation in contractual actions. (footnote omitted)), E. Farnsworth, Contracts § 12.17, p. 894 (1982) (describing rule of generally denying recovery for emotional disturbance, or `mental distress,' resulting from breach of contract as firmly rooted in tradition), J. Perillo, Calamari  & Perillo on Contracts § 14.5, p. 495 (6th ed. 2009) (Calamari & Perillo) (As a general rule, no damages will be awarded for the mental distress or emotional trauma that may be caused by a breach of contract.), C. McCormick, Law of Damages § 145, p. 592 (1935) (McCormick) (It is often stated as the `general rule' that, in actions for breach of contract, damages for mental suffering are not allowable.). Under Barnes, we therefore cannot treat federal funding recipients as having consented to be subject to damages for emotional distress. It follows that such damages are not recoverable under the Spending Clause statutes we consider here.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,52,"In arguing for a different result, Cummings recognizes that contract law dictates `the scope of damages remedies.' Brief for Petitioner 30. And she quotes the test set out in Barnes: whether a certain remedy is traditionally available in suits for breach of contract. Brief for Petitioner 31. But Cummings then argues that, notwithstanding the above authorities, traditional contract remedies in fact do include damages for emotional distress. Ibid., see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-20 (making the same argument), post, at 1580-1581 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (same).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,53,"That is because, Cummings explains, several contract treatises put forth the special rule that recovery for emotional disturbance is allowed in a particular circumstance: where the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result. Brief for Petitioner 31 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353). And, she contends, such a rule aptly describes the intentional breach of a promise to refrain from discrimination, because discrimination frequently engenders mental anguish. Brief for Petitioner 31. This argument suffers from two independently fatal flaws.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,54,"First, Cummings subtly but crucially transforms the contract-law analogy into a test that is inconsistent with both Barnes and our larger Spending Clause jurisprudence. Barnes, recall, instructs us to inquire whether a remedy is traditionally, generally, or normally available for contract actions. 536 U.S. at 187-188, 122 S.Ct. 2097. Cummings, however, would look not only to those general rules, but also to whether there is a more fine-grained or more directly applicable rule of contract remedies that, although not generally or normally applicable, governs in the specific context or particular setting of the pertinent Spending Clause provision. Brief for Petitioner 33-35, see also post, at 1581. In other words, Cummings would treat funding recipients as on notice that they will face not only the usual remedies available in contract actions, but also other unusual, even rare remedies, Brief for Petitioner 34, if those remedies would be recoverable in suits for breaches of the type of contractual commitments at issue, id., at 35.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,55,"Neither petitioner nor the United States attempts to ground this approach in Barnes, which, as discussed above, undertook nothing of the sort. Indeed, had Barnes analyzed the question as petitioner frames it, the decision would have come out the opposite way. As noted, although the general rule is that punitive damages are not available in contract, they are undoubtedly recoverable in cases where the breaching conduct is also a tort for which punitive damages are recoverable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 355. Such conduct would presumably include breaches of the type of contractual commitments at issue here, Brief for Petitioner 35-namely, the commitment not to discriminate. After all, intentional discrimination  is frequently a wanton, reprehensible tort. Barnes itself involved tortious conduct, 536 U.S. at 192, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), that the jury had found deplorable enough to warrant $1.2 million in punitive damages, id., at 184, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (opinion of the Court).

2021-021,61,"It did not matter to the Court in Barnes that the second clause of section 355 aptly describes a funding recipient's intentional breach of its promise to refrain from discrimination. Brief for Petitioner 31. Barnes did not even engage in such an inquiry, it simply stopped at the word unless. See 536 U.S. at 187-188, 122 S.Ct. 2097. Neither Cummings nor the United States adequately explains why we—bound by Barnes—should do anything different here. Indeed, reflected in the Restatement's similar treatment of emotional distress and punitive damages is the fact that the line between these two kinds of damages is indistinct and hard to draw. 11 J. Perillo, Corbin on Contracts § 59.1, p. 546 (rev. 11th ed. 2005) (Corbin), see also D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 12.4, p. 819 (1973) (Dobbs).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,62,"Beyond Barnes itself, petitioner's more fine-grained approach, Brief for Petitioner 33, cannot be squared with our contract analogy case law in general. As Cummings sees things, it makes no difference whether the governing contract rule here is an `exception,' id., at 34, because the governing rule is just that: the governing rule, id., at 35, see also post, at 1581. But our cases do not treat suits under Spending Clause legislation as literal suits in contract, Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 290, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011), subjecting funding recipients to whatever governing rules some general federal law of contracts would supply.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,63,"Rather, as set out above, we employ the contract analogy only as a potential limitation on liability compared to that which would exist under nonspending statutes. Ibid. We do so to ensure that funding recipients exercised their choice to take federal dollars knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of doing so. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531. Here, the statutes at issue say nothing about what those consequences will be. Nonetheless, consistent with Barnes, it is fair to consider recipients aware that, if they violate their promise to the Government, they will be subject to either damages or a court order to perform. Those are the usual forms of relief for breaching a legally enforceable commitment. No dive through the treatises, 50-state survey, or speculative drawing of analogies is required to anticipate their availability.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,64,"The approach offered by Cummings, by contrast, pushes the notion of offer and acceptance, Barnes, 536 U.S. at 186, 122 S.Ct. 2097, past its breaking point. It  is one thing to say that funding recipients will know the basic, general rules. It is quite another to assume that they will know the contours of every contract doctrine, no matter how idiosyncratic or exceptional. Yet that is the sort of clear notice that Cummings necessarily suggests funding recipients would have regarding the availability of emotional distress damages when engaged in the process of deciding whether to accept federal funds. Arlington, 548 U.S. at 296, 126 S.Ct. 2455. Such a diluted conception of knowledge has no place in our Spending Clause jurisprudence.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,65,"What is more, by essentially incorporating the law of contract remedies wholesale, Cummings's rendition of the analogy risks arrogating legislative power. Hernández v. Mesa, 589 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 735, 741, 206 L.Ed.2d 29 (2020). Recall that Barnes authorized the recovery of remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract under Spending Clause statutes, like those we consider here, that mention no remedies. 536 U.S. at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097. Barnes thus permitted federal courts to do something we are usually loath to do: find that a certain remedy is implied by a provision that makes no reference to that remedy, Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742. But Barnes also placed a clear limit on that authority, constraining courts to imply only those remedies that are normally available for contract actions. 536 U.S. at 188, 122 S.Ct. 2097. In urging us to disregard that restriction, Cummings would have us treat statutory silence as a license to freely supply remedies we cannot be sure Congress would have chosen to make available. That would be an untenable result in any context, let alone one in which our cases require clear notice regarding the liability at issue, Arlington, 548 U.S. at 296, 126 S.Ct. 2455.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,66,"Second, even if it were appropriate to treat funding recipients as aware that they may be subject to rare contract-law rules that are satisfied only in particular settings, Brief for Petitioner 34, funding recipients would still lack the requisite notice that emotional distress damages are available under the statutes at issue. That is because the Restatement's formulation— that such damages are available where the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353— does not reflect the consensus rule among American jurisdictions.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,67,"Far from it. As one commentator concluded after surveying all of the cases dealing with emotional distress recovery in contract actions over a decade after the Restatement's publication, a majority rule does not exist on the question. D. Whaley, Paying for the Agony: The Recovery of Emotional Distress Damages in Contract Actions, 26 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 935, 946 (1992), see also J. Chmiel, Damages—Recovery for Mental Suffering From Breach of Contract, 32 Notre Dame Law. 482 (1957) (noting little uniformity in the decided cases), Corbin § 59.1, at 538, 540 (Claims for damages for mental pain and suffering have caused much conflict and difference of opinion, and the law cannot be said to be entirely settled), Dobbs § 12.4, at 819-820 (although a group of cases have tried to formulate a broader doctrine akin to the Restatement view, the principle is a broad and relatively undefined one, and it is not clear how far it is or will be accepted by the courts). The contrary view of the dissent, see post, at 1578-1580, is more aspirational than descriptive.",Roberts,0,
2021-021,68,"To be sure, a number of States follow the Restatement rule and award emotional distress damages where the injury entails  more than a pecuniary loss, and the duty violated is closely associated with the feelings and emotions of the injured party. Chmiel, 32 Notre Dame Law., at 482. That represents the most liberal approach, Whaley, 26 Suffolk L. Rev., at 943, taken by a strong minority of courts, Corbin § 59.1, at 541, see also McCormick § 145, at 594-595. On the opposite end of the spectrum, however, several States squarely reject the Restatement, and altogether forbid recovery of emotional distress damages even where the contract relates to nonpecuniary matters. See, e.g., Tompkins v. Eckerd, Civ.No. 09-2369, 2012 WL 1110069, *4 (D.S.C., Apr. 3, 2012), Contreraz v. Michelotti-Sawyers, 271 Mont. 300, 309, 896 P.2d 1118, 1123 (1995), Keltner v. Washington County, 310 Ore. 499, 504-510, 800 P.2d 752, 754-758 (1990).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,69,"Most States reject the Restatement exception in a more nuanced way: by limiting the award of emotional distress damages to a narrow and idiosyncratic group of cases, rather than making them available in general wherever a breach would have been likely to inflict emotional harm. Calamari & Perillo § 14.5, at 495-496. A good example is New York, which refused to apply the Restatement rule, and denied emotional distress damages, where the defendant hospital breached its contractual duty to return a newborn child to his parents by failing to prevent his abduction. Johnson v. Jamaica Hospital, 62 N.Y.2d 523, 528-529, 467 N.E.2d 502, 504, 478 N.Y.S.2d 838 (1984), see also id., at 536-537, 478 N.Y.S.2d 838, 467 N.E.2d at 509 (Meyer, J., dissenting).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,70,"These jurisdictions confine recovery for mental anguish where nonpecuniary contracts are at issue in two main ways. First, a number permit recovery only if the breach also qualifies as unusually evil, with the precise terminology varying from reckless and willful to wanton and reprehensible. D. Hoffman & A. Radus, Instructing Juries on Noneconomic Contract Damages, 81 Fordham L. Rev. 1221, 1227 (2012) (emphasis deleted), see Corbin § 59.1, at 546-547, Chmiel, 32 Notre Dame Law., at 484-485, see, e.g., Giampapa v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 64 P.3d 230, 238-239 (Colo. 2003).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,71,"Second, many States limit recovery for mental anguish to only a narrow class of contracts upon breach of which the injured party may, if he so elect, bring an action sounding in tort. Smith v. Sanborn State Bank, 147 Iowa 640, 643, 126 N.W. 779, 780 (1910), Corbin § 59.1, at 538, see, e.g., Johnson, 62 N.Y.2d at 528, 478 N.Y.S.2d 838, 467 N.E.2d at 504. Such cases most prominently include those against carriers, telegraph companies, and innkeepers —all of whom are bound by certain duties that are independent of contract, but who usually also have made a contract for the performance of the duty. Corbin § 59.1, at 538, Chmiel, 32 Notre Dame Law., at 488. Others involve contracts for the carriage or proper disposition of dead bodies, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353, Comment a, which similarly might be seen as tort cases quite apart from the contract, since one who negligently mishandles a body could be liable in tort even if there were no contract at all. Dobbs § 12.4, at 819, see also McCormick § 145, at 594-595, 597, see, e.g., Wright v. Beardsley, 46 Wash. 16, 16-20, 89 P. 172, 172-174 (1907).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,72,"Many of these cases unsurprisingly mix contract, quasi-contract, and tort principles together. Dobbs, § 12.4, at 818, n. 10 (The carrier who insults his passenger is liable to him in tort  but cases often speak of an implied term in the contract as governing this point.), Knoxville Traction Co. v. Lane, 103 Tenn. 376, 386, 53 S.W. 557, 560 (1899) (The gravamen of this action is the defendant's breach of its contract of carriage,  which includes  the duty to protect the passenger from insult or injury.), Chamberlain v. Chandler, 5 F.Cas. 413, 414 (No. 2,575) (C.C. Mass. 1823) (opinion of Story, J.) (ship captain violated the carriage contract's implied stipulation against general obscenity).* As such, it makes little sense to treat such cases as establishing or evincing a rule of contract law—a principle with which the United States agrees, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31, n. 5 (arguing that cases based on tort principles are not instructive for purposes of the contract-law analogy).",Roberts,0,
2021-021,73,"In the end, it is apparent that the closest our legal system comes to a universal rule—or even a widely followed one—regarding the availability of emotional distress damages in contract actions is the conventional wisdom  that such damages are for highly unusual contracts, which do not fit into the core of contract law. Hoffman, 81 Fordham L. Rev., at 1230. As to which highly unusual contracts trigger the exceptional allowance of such damages, the only area of agreement is that there is no agreement. There is thus no basis in contract law to maintain that emotional distress damages are traditionally available in suits for breach of contract, Barnes, 536 U.S. at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097, and correspondingly no ground, under our cases, to conclude that federal funding recipients have clear notice, Arlington, 548 U.S. at 296, 126 S.Ct. 2455, that they would face such a remedy in private actions brought to enforce the statutes at issue.* * *",Roberts,0,
2021-021,74,"For the foregoing reasons, we hold that emotional distress damages are not recoverable under the Spending Clause antidiscrimination statutes we consider here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.",Roberts,0,

2021-021,77,"In analyzing whether compensatory damages for emotional distress are available under the implied Title VI cause of action, both the Court and the dissent ably employ the contract-law analogy set forth by this Court's precedents. See, e.g., Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186, 122 S.Ct. 2097, 153 L.Ed.2d 230 (2002). The dueling and persuasive opinions illustrate, however, that the contract-law analogy is an imperfect way to determine the remedies for this implied cause of action.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-021,78,"Instead of continuing to rely on that imperfect analogy, I would reorient the inquiry to focus on a background interpretive principle rooted in the Constitution's separation of powers. Congress, not this Court, creates new causes of action. See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286-287, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001). And with respect to existing implied causes of action, Congress, not this Court, should extend those implied causes  of action and expand available remedies. Cf. Hernández v. Mesa, 589 U.

In my view, that background interpretive principle— more than contract-law analysis— counsels against judicially authorizing compensatory damages for emotional distress in suits under the implied Title VI cause of action.",Kavanaugh,0,

2021-021,80,"Using its Spending Clause authority, Congress has enacted four statutes that prohibit recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of certain protected characteristics, including (depending upon the statute) race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. See Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, Education Amendments Act of 1972, Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, § 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), § 1557, 42 U.S.C. § 18116. We have held that victims of intentional violations of these statutes may bring lawsuits seeking to recover, among other relief, compensatory damages. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 76, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992). Today, the Court holds that the compensatory damages available under these statutes cannot include compensation for emotional suffering.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,81,"The Court has asked the right question: Would a prospective funding recipient, at the time it engaged in the process of deciding whether to accept federal dollars, have been aware that it would face such liability? Ante, at 1570 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). And it has correctly observed that our precedents instruct us to answer this question by drawing an analogy to contract law. But I disagree with how the Court has applied that analogy.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,82,"The Court looks broadly at all contracts. It says that, most of the time, damages for breach of contract did not include compensation for emotional distress. Ante, at 1571-1572. And it then holds that emotional distress damages are not available under the Spending Clause statutes at issue here. Ibid. But, in my view, contracts analogous to these statutes did allow for recovery of emotional distress damages. Emotional distress damages were traditionally available when the contract or the breach was of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353, p. 149 (1979).",Breyer,0,
2021-021,83,"The Spending Clause statutes before us prohibit intentional invidious discrimination. That kind of discrimination is particularly likely to cause serious emotional disturbance. Thus, applying our precedents' contract analogy, I would hold that victims of intentional violations of these antidiscrimination statutes can recover compensatory damages for emotional suffering. I respectfully dissent.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,85,"I begin with agreement. First, like the Court, I recognize that it is `beyond dispute that private individuals may sue to enforce' the four antidiscrimination statutes we consider here. Ante, at 1569 (quoting Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185, 122 S.Ct. 2097, 153 L.Ed.2d 230 (2002)). Title VI (prohibiting race discrimination) and Title IX (prohibiting sex discrimination) contain implied rights of action that have been ratified by Congress. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280,  121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001). The Rehabilitation Act (prohibiting disability discrimination) and the ACA (prohibiting race, sex, disability, and age discrimination) expressly incorporate the rights and remedies available under Title VI. 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). We have treated these statutes as providing coextensive remedies. Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185, 122 S.Ct. 2097. Thus, the Court's decision today will affect the remedies available under all four of these statutes, impacting victims of race, sex, disability, and age discrimination alike.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,86,"Second, like the Court, I also recognize that recipients of federal funding are subject to a particular form of liability only if they are on notice that, by accepting the funds, they expose themselves to that form of liability. Id., at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097. And a funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject  to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract. Ibid. Thus, the basic question here is whether damages for emotional suffering were traditionally available as remedies in suits for breach of contract. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,88,"Unlike the Court, though, I believe the answer to that basic question is yes. Damages for emotional suffering have long been available as remedies for suits in breach of contract—at least where the breach was particularly likely to cause suffering of that kind.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,89,"A general, overarching principle of contract remedies is set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts: Contract damages are ordinarily based on the injured party's expectation interest and are intended to give him the benefit of his bargain by awarding him a sum of money that will, to the extent possible, put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed. § 347, Comment a, at 112, see also 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts § 12.8, p. 188 (2d ed. 1998) (Farnsworth) (The basic principle for the measurement of those damages is that of compensation based on the injured party's expectation), 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts § 1338, p. 2392 (1920) (Williston) (The general purpose of the law is, and should be, to give compensation: —that is, to put the plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in had the defendant kept his contract).",Breyer,0,
2021-021,90,"This simple principle helps explain why compensatory damages are generally available as remedies and punitive damages are not. By definition, compensatory damages serve contract law's general purpose, namely, to give compensation. Ibid. But punitive damages go beyond compensating the injured party for lost expectation and instead put him in a better position than had the contract been performed. 3 Farnsworth § 12.8, at 193.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,91,"The same general principle also helps to explain the many cases in which damages for emotional suffering are not available. Most contracts are commercial contracts entered for pecuniary gain. Pecuniary remedies are therefore typically sufficient to compensate the injured party for their expected losses. See, e.g., C. McCormick, Law of Damages § 145, p. 592 (1935) (McCormick) (Most contracts which come before the courts are commercial contracts. The pecuniary interest is dominant), 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 156 (1883) (Sutherland) (In actions upon contract, the losses sustained do not, by reason of the nature of the transactions which they involve, embrace, ordinarily, any other than pecuniary elements), 3 Farnsworth § 12.17, at 894-895 (The real basis of this rule is that recovery for emotional distress is likely to result in disproportionate compensation), cf. Restatement  (Second) of Contracts § 351(1), at 135 (Damages are not recoverable for loss that the party in breach did not have reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach when the contract was made).",Breyer,0,
2021-021,92,"Finally, and most importantly here, the same general rule also helps to explain the cases in which contract law did make available damages for emotional suffering. Contract law treatises make clear that expected losses from the breach of a contract entered for nonpecuniary purposes might reasonably include nonpecuniary harms. So contract law traditionally does award damages for emotional distress where other than pecuniary benefits were contracted for or where the breach was particularly likely to result in serious emotional disturbance. 3 Williston § 1340, at 2396, 3 Farnsworth § 12.17, at 895, see also, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353, at 149 (Recovery for emotional disturbance was allowed where the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result), 1 Sutherland 157-158 (damages should be appropriate to the objects of the contract), 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages § 45, p. 61 (8th ed. 1891) (Sedgwick) (`Where other than pecuniary benefits are contracted for, other than pecuniary standards will be applied to the ascertainment of damages flowing from the breach').",Breyer,0,
2021-021,93,"Examples of contracts that gave rise to emotional distress damages under this rule have included, among others, contracts for marriage, see, e.g., 1 Sutherland 156, and n. 4, contracts by common carriers, innkeepers, or places of public resort or entertainment, see, e.g., McCormick § 145, at 593, and nn. 48-50, contracts related to the handling of a body, see, e.g., 1 Sedgwick § 45, at 62, and n. a, contracts for delivery of a sensitive telegram message, see, e.g., id., at 62, and n. b, and more. In these cases, emotional distress damages are compensatory because they `make good the wrong done.' Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66, 112 S.Ct. 1028, see also Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 307, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986).",Breyer,0,
2021-021,95,"Does breach of a promise not to discriminate fall into this category? I should think so. The statutes before us seek to eradicate invidious discrimination. That purpose is clearly nonpecuniary. And discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability is particularly likely to cause serious emotional harm. Often, emotional injury is the primary (sometimes the only) harm caused by discrimination, with pecuniary injury at most secondary. Consider, for example, the plaintiff in Franklin —a high school student who was repeatedly sexually assaulted by her teacher. 503 U.S. at 63-64, 112 S.Ct. 1028. Or the plaintiff in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004), who used a wheelchair and, because a building lacked wheelchair accessibility, was forced to crawl up two flights of stairs. Id., at 513-514, 124 S.Ct. 1978. Or the many historical examples of racial segregation in which Black patrons were made to use separate facilities or services. Regardless of whether financial injuries were present in these cases, the major (and foreseeable) harm was the emotional distress caused by the indignity and humiliation of discrimination itself.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,96,"As a Member of this Court noted in respect to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress' antidiscrimination laws seek the vindication of human dignity and not mere economics. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 291, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring).

2021-021,97,"`Discrimination is not simply dollars and cents, hamburgers and movies, it is the humiliation, frustration, and embarrassment that a person must surely feel when he is told that he is unacceptable as a member of the public because of his race or color. It is equally the inability to explain to a child that regardless of education, civility, courtesy, and morality he will be denied the right to enjoy equal treatment, even though he be a citizen of the United States and may well be called upon to lay down his life to assure this Nation continues.'

2021-021,98,"It is difficult to believe that prospective funding recipients would be unaware that intentional discrimination based on race, sex, age, or disability is particularly likely to cause emotional suffering. Nor do I believe they would be unaware that, were an analogous contractual breach at issue, they could be held legally liable for causing suffering of that kind. The contract rule allowing emotional distress damages under such circumstances is neither obscure nor unsettled, as the Court claims. Ante, at 1572, 1573-1574. To the contrary, it is clearly laid out in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts: Recovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result. § 353, at 149 (emphasis added). And the Restatement's rule is well supported by treatise writers, who have described the law similarly. See, e.g., 3 Farnsworth § 12.17, at 895, 1 Sedgwick § 45, at 62, 16 J. Murray, Corbin on Contracts § AG-59.01, p. 855 (2017) (Emotional damages arising from racial or other forms of discrimination are clearly foreseeable. There should be no question about their recovery in a contract action where such conduct is proven). I would therefore conclude that contract law is sufficiently clear to put prospective funding recipients on notice that intentional discrimination can expose them to potential liability for emotional suffering.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,100,"In concluding otherwise, the Court invokes our decision in Barnes. In Barnes, we reaffirmed that funding recipients could be held liable for compensatory damages because compensatory damages are a form of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of contract. 536 U.S. at 187, 122 S.Ct. 2097. But, we held, they are not liable for punitive damages because punitive damages were generally not available for breach of contract. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,101,"The Court today reads Barnes to imply that prospective funding recipients can only be expected to be aware of basic, general rules, not exceptions or subsidiary rules that govern specific circumstances. Ante, at 1574. How does the Court derive that restrictive approach from Barnes, which did not purport to announce such a limitation? Because, the Court says, punitive damages were sometimes available in suits for breach of contract where the breach was `also a tort for which punitive damages are recoverable.' Ante, at 1573 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 355). The Court assumes that Barnes must have refused to consider any exceptions at all because otherwise it would have relied on this exception to hold that punitive damages were available. Ante, at 1573. The Court believes that damages for emotional suffering are similar: It says they, too, are available only under an exception to the general rule, and that exception is too `fine-grained' to put federal funding recipients on notice of  their potential exposure to liability.

2021-021,102,"The Court's comparison to punitive damages is, in my view, unpersuasive. Punitive damages are not embraced by Barnes' contract-law analogy because they do not serve contract law's central purpose of compensating the injured party, instead, they punish the party in breach. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 355, Comment a, at 154, see also Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (distinguishing punitive damages, which are unavailable, from compensatory damages, which are available, because the former do not `make good the wrong done'). Accordingly, the punitive damages exception cited by the Court does not rely on contract-law principles at all, but rather, on tort law. The Restatement clarifies that, when contract and tort claims may overlap, contract law does not preclude an award of punitive damages  if such an award would be proper under the law of torts. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 355, Comment b, at 155 (emphasis added), see also id., at 156 (including Illustrations in which the right to recover punitive damages is governed by Restatement, Second, Torts § 908). This special feature makes the punitive damages exception an inapt comparator for Barnes' contract-law analogy.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,103,"The same is not true of emotional distress damages. The Restatement does not attribute the availability of emotional distress damages to tort rather than contract law. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 353, at 149, see also McCormick § 145, at 593-594 (Sometimes reliance is placed upon accompanying tortious conduct such as assault or defamation  but not always, nor do these elements seem essential (emphasis added)), e.g., Aaron v. Ward, 203 N.Y. 351, 354, 96 N.E. 736, 737 (1911) (The action is for a breach of the defendant's contract and not for a tortious expulsion). That makes sense because, unlike punitive damages, emotional distress damages can, and do, serve contract law's central purpose of compensating the injured party for their expected losses, at least where the contract secured primarily nonpecuniary benefits and contemplated primarily nonpecuniary injuries. As I said above, in such cases, emotional distress damages are a form of compensatory damages that `make good the wrong done.' Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66, 112 S.Ct. 1028, see also Memphis Community School Dist., 477 U.S. at 306-307, and n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 2537.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,104,"I have already explained above why I believe federal funding recipients would be aware that intentional invidious discrimination is particularly likely to cause emotional suffering. And I have also explained why, aware of general principles of contract law, they would also be aware that damages for emotional suffering are available for breaches of contract where other than pecuniary benefits were contracted for or where the breach was particularly likely to result in serious emotional disturbance. 3 Williston § 1340, at 2396, 3 Farnsworth § 12.17, at 895, supra, at 1570-1571. Nothing in our opinion in Barnes requires us to ignore these `directly applicable' contract rules in favor of the less applicable, general rule on which the Court relies. Ante, at 1572 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 35). Indeed, reliance on an analogy only works when we compare things that are actually analogous. Here, the rules that govern analogous breaches of contract tell us that emotional distress damages can be available for violations of statutes that prohibit intentional discrimination.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,106,"Finally, we might recall why we look to contract rules at all. The contract-law analogy  is a tool for answering the ultimate question whether federal funding recipients can appropriately be held liable for emotional suffering. Cf. Barnes, 536 U.S. at 191, 122 S.Ct. 2097 (Souter, J., concurring) (warning about the limitations of the contract-law analogy). In answering that question, we must remain mindful of the need to ensure a sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the statute. Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 284, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998). The Court's holding today will not help to achieve that result.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,107,"Instead, the Court's decision creates an anomaly. Other antidiscrimination statutes, for which Congress has provided an express cause of action, permit recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress. See 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3) (expressly providing for compensatory damages, including damages for emotional pain, suffering, and mental anguish under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act), Memphis Community School Dist., 477 U.S. at 307, 106 S.Ct. 2537 (allowing recovery under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, of compensatory damages for `personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering'). Employees who suffer discrimination at the hands of their employers can recover damages for emotional suffering, as can individuals who suffer discrimination at the hands of state officials. But, until Congress acts to fix this inequity, the Court's decision today means that those same remedies will be denied to students who suffer discrimination at the hands of their teachers, patients who suffer discrimination at the hands of their doctors, and others.",Breyer,0,
2021-021,108,"It is difficult to square the Court's holding with the basic purposes that antidiscrimination laws seek to serve. One such purpose, as I have said, is to vindicate human dignity and not mere economics. Heart of Atlanta, 379 U.S. at 291, 85 S.Ct. 348 (Goldberg, J., concurring). But the Court's decision today allows victims of discrimination to recover damages only if they can prove that they have suffered economic harm, even though the primary harm inflicted by discrimination is rarely economic. Indeed, victims of intentional discrimination may sometimes suffer profound emotional injury without any attendant pecuniary harms. See, e.g., Franklin, 503 U.S. at 63-64, 76, 112 S.Ct. 1028.

We have suggested in another context that restrain sometimes has a broad meaning that refers to judicial orders that inhibit particular actions, and at other times it has a narrower meaning that includes orders that stop (or perhaps compel) such acts. Direct Marketing Assn. v. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 12-13, 135 S.Ct. 1124, 191 L.Ed.2d 97 (2015) (emphasis deleted).",Alito,0,
2021-022,45,"The object of the verbs enjoin or restrain is the operation of certain provisions of federal immigration law. See §§ 1221-1232. The operation of (a thing) means the functioning of or working of (that thing). Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1357 (2d ed. 1987) (an act or instance, process, or manner of functioning or operating), Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 1581 (method or manner of functioning). The way in which laws ordinarily work or function is through the actions of officials or other persons who implement them. This is certainly true of the statutes to which § 1252(f)(1) refers—i.e., the provisions of part IV of subchapter II of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Those provisions charge the Federal Government with the implementation and enforcement of the immigration laws governing the inspection, apprehension, examination, and removal of aliens. See §§ 1221-1232. Accordingly, the operation of the relevant statutes is best understood to refer to the Government's efforts to enforce or implement them. As the Government put it at oral argument, the operation of the provisions is a reference not just to the statute itself but to the way that it is being carried out. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11.",Alito,0,
2021-022,46,"Putting these terms together, § 1252(f)(1) generally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions.",Alito,0,

2021-022,50,"This interpretation follows from the statutory text. In framing the exception to the general ban on injunctive relief, Congress used the phrase an individual alien. It thus employed a singular noun (an alien), modified by an adjective (individual) that means pertaining or belonging to, or characteristic, of one single person. Black's Law Dictionary, at 783. Therefore, § 1252(f)(1) does not preclude a court from entering injunctive relief on behalf of a particular alien (so long as proceedings against the alien have been initiated), but injunctive relief on behalf of an entire class of aliens is not allowed because it is not limited to remedying the unlawful application of the relevant statutes to an individual alien.",Alito,0,
2021-022,52,"On this interpretation of § 1252(f)(1), the injunctions entered by the District Courts in these cases were barred. The respondents in both cases were detained pursuant to § 1231(a)(6), and no one disputes that § 1231(a)(6) is among the provisions the operation of which cannot be enjoined or restrained under § 1252(f)(1). Both District Courts entered injunctions requiring the Government to provide bond hearings not only for respondents but also for all other class members.1 Those orders enjoin or restrain the operation of § 1231(a)(6) because they require officials to take actions that (in the Government's view) are not required by § 1231(a)(6) and to refrain from actions that (again in the Government's view) are allowed by § 1231(a)(6). Those injunctions thus interfere with the Government's efforts to operate § 1231(a)(6), and the injunctions do not fall within the exception for individualized relief because the injunctions were entered on behalf of entire classes of aliens.2  B",Alito,0,
2021-022,53,"Respondents advance two counter-arguments, but both fail.",Alito,0,
2021-022,55,Respondents first contend that the operation of the covered immigration provisions means the operation of those provisions as properly interpreted and that what § 1252(f)(1) bars are class-wide injunctions that prohibit the Government from doing what the statute allows or commands. Brief for Respondents 49 (emphasis added).,Alito,0,
2021-022,56,"We do not think that this is the most natural interpretation of the term operation, since it is very common to refer to the unlawful or improper operation of whatever it is that is being operated. See, e.g., Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 253, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 168 L.Ed.2d 132 (2007) (unlawful operation of the car), Kansas v.

Ladd, 795 F.2d 1479, 1485 (CA9 1986) (unlawful operation of its CATV cable systems (internal quotation marks omitted)). If cars, trucks, railroads, water utilities, drainage ditches, auto dealerships, planes, radios, video poker machines, cable TV systems, and many other things can be unlawfully or improperly operated, it is not apparent why the same cannot be said of a statute. Thus, the ordinary meaning of the language of § 1252(f)(1) weighs against respondents' interpretation.3",Alito,0,
2021-022,57,"Apart from ordinary meaning, the statutory context provides three additional reasons to reject respondents' reading. First, respondents' interpretation, which makes the reach of § 1252(f)(1) depend on the nature of the claim in question, clashes with § 1252(f)(1)'s prefatory clause, which states that the bar applies regardless of the nature of the action or claim. See also  Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 954, 975, 203 L.Ed.2d 333 (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).",Alito,0,
2021-022,58,"Second, respondents' interpretation would limit § 1252(f)(1)'s restriction to a most unlikely set of claims. With perhaps a few small exceptions,4 the only claims to which § 1252(f)(1)'s prohibition would apply are constitutional claims. But it would be most unusual for Congress to disfavor constitutional claims in this way. Cf. Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603, 108 S.Ct. 2047, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988) (requiring clear indication of congressional intent to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims). And if Congress had wanted to target just constitutional claims, it could have surely made the point more directly. The suggestion that Congress sought to achieve that goal by using the term operation is far-fetched.",Alito,0,
2021-022,59,"Third, respondents' interpretation would make a court's jurisdiction to entertain a request for class-wide injunctive relief dependent upon the merits of the claim. Under respondents' reading, if a complaint sought class-wide relief on the ground that the Government was misinterpreting and misapplying a covered statutory provision, the court would proceed to adjudicate the merits of that claim and might even hold a trial. But if the court ultimately rejected the claim on the merits, that holding would mean that the court never had jurisdiction to grant that request for relief.5",Alito,0,
2021-022,60,"For all these reasons, respondents' interpretation of operation must be rejected.",Alito,0,
2021-022,62,"Respondents next argue that § 1252(f)(1) allows class-wide relief so long as all the class members are individuals who already face the enforcement action. Brief for Respondents 55 (emphasis added). But § 1252(f)(1) refers to an individual, not individuals, and as noted, we have stated on more than one occasion that it bars class-wide injunctive relief. See American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. at 481, 119 S.Ct. 936, Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 851, Nken, 556 U.S. at 431, 129 S.Ct. 1749.",Alito,0,
2021-022,63,"Respondents dispute the correctness of these statements and point out that a  nearby provision, § 1252(e)(1)(B), expressly bars the certification of a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Because § 1252(f)(1) lacks any express reference to class actions, respondents infer that no preclusion of class-wide relief was intended.",Alito,0,
2021-022,64,"We are reluctant to give much weight to this negative inference. It is possible that § 1252(f)(1) simply uses different language to bar class-wide injunctive relief and extends no further. But if the provision is not read that way, then the most plausible reading is not that it allows class-wide relief but rather that it permits injunctive relief only with respect to the application of a covered provision to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated. § 1252(f)(1) (emphasis added). A literal reading of that language could rule out efforts to obtain any injunctive relief that applies to multiple named plaintiffs (or perhaps even rule out injunctive relief in a lawsuit brought by multiple named plaintiffs).",Alito,0,
2021-022,65,"The Government does not advocate that we adopt such an interpretation, see Reply Brief 11, and we have no occasion to do so in these cases. It is sufficient to hold that the class-wide injunctive relief awarded in these cases was unlawful.6* * *",Alito,0,

2021-022,80,"Section 1252(f)(1) includes two operative clauses: a primary clause that strips courts of authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the specified provisions of the INA, and a saving clause that reserves that authority as applied to a noncitizen against whom proceedings  have been initiated. Properly read, both clauses independently preserve the lower courts' authority to order classwide injunctive relief compelling the Executive Branch to comply with the INA in these cases. The Court holds otherwise only by disregarding the language Congress used in § 1252(f)(1) itself, elsewhere in § 1252, and in the INA as a whole.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,83,"Section 1252(f)(1)'s primary clause provides that the lower federal courts may not enjoin or restrain the operation of the specified provisions of the INA. An injunction that compels the Executive Branch to comply with the specified provisions (or, phrased differently, prohibits the unlawful implementation of the specified provisions) does not enjoin or restrain the operation of those provisions.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,84,"This is clear as a matter of plain meaning. Starting with the word operation, all agree that the ordinary meaning of operation is functioning or working. Ante, at 2064-2065. An injunction requiring the Executive Branch to conform its conduct with a statute or to cease statutorily unauthorized conduct does not enjoin or restrain the functioning or working of the statute. That is because unlawful agency action is not a part of the functioning or working of the authorizing statute.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,85,"The Government responds that operation, as used in § 1252(f)(1), is synonymous with implementation, which may include either lawful or unlawful implementation. This contention, however, disregards Congress' careful choice of language. Section 1252(f)(1) says nothing about enjoining or restraining the Executive Branch's implementation of the law. By contrast, in other subsections of § 1252 enacted simultaneously with this one, Congress twice expressly limited jurisdiction over challenges to implementation of a statute or order or specified a particular forum for judicial review of such challenges. See § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i) (restricting jurisdiction to review claims arising from or relating to the implementation or operation of an order of removal), § 1252(e)(3)(A) (channeling review of the implementation of specified provisions into the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia), see also § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv) (limiting jurisdiction to review procedures and policies adopted by the Attorney General to implement a certain provision). As this Court previously explained when interpreting this very statute: `Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section  it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 430, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009). This is particularly true here, where the relevant subsections of § 1252 were enacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review procedures. Id., at 430-431, 129 S.Ct. 1749.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,86,"In addition to Congress' deliberate use of operation, its use of enjoin or restrain in this context is most naturally read to bar only lower court injunctions that stop the operation of a statute, not those that command the Executive Branch to conform its conduct to the statute. It is true that, depending on the context, the word enjoin may describe a prohibition (abstain or desist from  some act) or an affirmative command (perform   some act). Black's Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed. 1990), see ante, at 2064. In § 1252(f)(1), however, clear textual signals point to the conclusion that enjoin refers to a prohibition on the operation of a statute. First, Congress consistently has used the term enjoin in Title 8 to refer to prohibitions, including in the immediately neighboring and simultaneously enacted subsection, § 1252(f)(2).3 A standard principle of statutory construction provides that identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning, Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S.Ct. 2411, 168 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007), particularly where, as here, the same term was used in related provisions enacted at the same time, Return Mail, Inc. v. Postal Service, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1853, 1865, 204 L.Ed.2d 179 (2019). Even beyond § 1252 itself, every use of enjoin in Title 8 refers to prohibitory injunctions.4 Moreover, in § 1252(f)(1) specifically, enjoin is paired with the term restrain, which means to check, hold back, or prevent (a person or thing) from some course of action. 8 Oxford English Dictionary 756 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis deleted). The company the word keeps, Direct Marketing Assn. v. Brohl, 575 U.S. 1, 13, 135 S.Ct. 1124, 191 L.Ed.2d 97 (2015), thus cements a prohibitory reading of enjoin. Under this reading, lower courts may not prohibit the operation of the specified statutes, but nothing in § 1252(f)(1) prevents them from commanding compliance with the statutes or enjoining unauthorized agency action.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,87,"Finally, if any ambiguity remains as to the meaning of the primary enjoin or restrain the operation of clause, a longstanding clear-statement principle counsels in favor of preserving the lower courts' remaining equitable jurisdiction. This Court `will not construe a statute to displace courts' traditional equitable authority absent the clearest command.' McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 397, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013) (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 646, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010)), accord, e.g., Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946), Brown v. Swann, 10 Pet. 497, 503, 9 L.Ed. 508 (1836). There can be no doubt that § 1252(f)(1) operates to displace equitable authority to an extent. As explained, however, the most natural and contextual reading of the provision's primary clause does not limit federal courts' authority to enjoin or restrain agency action unauthorized by statute, or to compel agency action commanded by a statute. The clause contains nothing approaching the clear command necessary, under centuries of this Court's precedents, to displace that authority.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,89,"Independently of § 1252(f)(1)'s primary clause, the provision's saving clause also  operates to preserve the lower federal courts' equitable authority here. That clause provides that lower courts may enjoin or restrain the operation of the covered statutory provisions with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated. § 1252(f)(1). Each beneficiary of the injunctions in these cases is an individual alien against whom removal proceedings have been initiated. Ibid. Under these circumstances, § 1252(f)(1) poses no barrier to classwide injunctive relief.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,90,"The Government contends that the phrase an individual alien is inconsistent with injunctive relief on a classwide basis. A class action, however, is a collection of individual claims. See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979) (Where the district court has jurisdiction over the claim of each individual member of the class, Rule 23 provides a procedure by which the court may exercise that jurisdiction over the various individual claims in a single proceeding), Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408, 130 S.Ct. 1431, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (A class action, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate suits). Moreover, contextual and historical evidence demonstrates that the enacting Congress would not have prohibited classwide relief simply by using the word individual.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,91,"It was well understood when Congress enacted § 1252(f)(1) in 1996 that mere use of the word individual would not preclude classwide adjudication or relief. In Califano, a unanimous Court interpreted § 205(g) of the Social Security Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), to permit class actions and classwide relief, even though the statute provided only that `any individual' could obtain judicial review. See 442 U.S. at 698-701, 99 S.Ct. 2545. The Court rejected the Government's argument that the word individual required a case-by-case adjudication of claims under § 205(g) that is incompatible with class relief. Id., at 698-699, 99 S.Ct. 2545. Class relief is consistent with the need for case-by-case adjudication, the Court noted, at least so long as the membership of the class is limited to those who meet the requirements of the provision. Id., at 701, 99 S.Ct. 2545.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,92,"We normally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648, 130 S.Ct. 1784, 176 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010). When § 1252(f)(1) was enacted in 1996, that precedent included both Califano and the settled rule, discussed above, that a statute should not be construed to displace a court's equitable authority absent a clear command. Yet Congress provided no such command against all classwide injunctive relief in § 1252(f)(1).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,93,"Indeed, in other subsections of § 1252, Congress provided precisely such a clear command. Section 1252(e)(1)(B), enacted simultaneously with § 1252(f)(1), explicitly divests federal courts of authority to certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in certain cases. The enacting Congress thus knew how to preclude classwide relief and did so in unmistakable terms when that was its intent. In § 1252(f)(1), however, it made no mention of class actions or Rule 23. Again, `it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion' of language, particularly where, as here, it enacted the language as part of a unified whole. Nken, 556 U.S. at 430, 129 S.Ct. 1749.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,94,"The Government responds that this reading of § 1252(f)(1)'s saving clause renders the word individual superfluous. `Sometimes the better overall reading of the statute contains some redundancy,' however, as Congress may employ a belt and suspenders approach to ensure its aims are met. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Christian, 590 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5, 140 S.Ct. 1335, 1350, n. 5, 206 L.Ed.2d 516 (2020). Relevant here, parties other than individuals in removal proceedings may bring immigration-related lawsuits. For example, prior to 1996, several organizations brought preenforcement challenges to immigration statutes. See Brief for Respondents 55 (collecting examples). In recent years, States, too, increasingly have sued on behalf of their own interests. See, e.g., Biden v. Texas, No. 21-954, now pending before the Court, Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U. S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 1891, 207 L.Ed.2d 353 (2020), United States v. Texas, 579 U.S. 547, 136 S.Ct. 2271, 195 L.Ed.2d 638 (2016) (per curiam). In drafting § 1252(f)(1), Congress had every reason to be doubly sure, Barton v. Barr, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1442, 1453, 206 L.Ed.2d 682 (2020), that only individuals in removal proceedings and not other entities would receive injunctive relief restraining the operation of the specified provisions of the INA. Additionally, the Government's redundancy concern is particularly unpersuasive because Congress used the adjective individual redundantly in other immigration-related provisions within Title 8. See § 1446(a) (authorizing the Attorney General to waive investigation of applicant for naturalization in an individual case or in such cases or classes of cases as may be designated by him), § 1601(4) (expressing concern that individual aliens, prior to 1996, were burdening the public benefits system).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,96,"In sum, the courts below retained their equitable authority to issue classwide injunctive relief for two independent reasons. First, the relief the District Courts issued did not purport to enjoin or restrain the operation of any statute, rather, the District Courts sought to enforce a statute and enjoin what they deemed to be unlawful agency action. Second, and in any event, the injunctive relief issued below fell within § 1252(f)(1)'s saving clause because it concerned only the application of provisions of the INA to individual noncitizens in removal proceedings.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,97,"This interpretation is a reasonable one. Congress' express and particular use of words in § 1252(f)(1) protected the specified statutory provisions against restraint by lower court injunctions, but evinced no quarrel with lower courts ensuring that the Executive Branch complied with the commands in those provisions. In addition, Congress ensured that this goal did not come at the expense of violating the rights of noncitizens in removal proceedings.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,99,The Court reaches a contrary result only by prioritizing unavailing and largely atextual concerns.,Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,101,"Starting with the primary enjoin or restrain the operation of clause, the Court accepts the Government's argument that the `operation of' the relevant statutes is best understood to refer to the Government's efforts to enforce or implement them. Ante, at 2064. Aside from ignoring Congress' choice to restrict judicial review of implementation in some subsections of § 1252 but not others, the Court misapprehends how statutes operate. No doubt, laws ordinarily `work' or  `function'  through the actions of officials or other persons who implement them. Ante, at 2064. That proposition, however, only holds if those individuals properly implement the relevant statute. An unlawful implementation of a statute is not the working or functioning of the statute at all, it is simply unauthorized. Restraining such action does not interfere with the operation of the statute for purposes of § 1252(f)(1).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,102,"Resisting this result, the Court offers a string cite of several inapt uses of operation, none of which concern the operation of legal authority. See ante, at 2065-2066. The Court wonders why, if cars, trucks, railroads, water utilities, drainage ditches, auto dealerships, planes, radios, video poker machines, cable TV systems, and many other things can be unlawfully or improperly operated,  the same cannot be said of a statute. Ante, at 2066. The answer is obvious: Unlike all of those examples, a statute is the law. Officials may implement a statute unlawfully, but a statute does not operate in conflict with itself.5",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,103,"The Court also agrees with the Government that enjoin, as used in § 1252(f)(1), necessarily takes on both affirmative and negative connotations, but only by rigidly segmenting each word in the clause, defining each in isolation, and adding those definitions together. See ante, at 2064. Elsewhere, however, this Court has cautioned against such a piecemeal approach to statutory interpretation. Cf., e.g., FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 406, 131 S.Ct. 1177, 179 L.Ed.2d 132 (2011) (cautioning that two words together may assume a more particular meaning than those words in isolation). Moreover, the Court pays no mind to Congress' other uses of enjoin in § 1252 and elsewhere in Title 8 as meaning banning or stopping.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,104,"The Court offers one final purportedly textual basis for its strained reading of the primary clause: that it is the only option consistent with § 1252(f)(1)'s prefatory clause. See ante, at 2066-2067, § 1252(f)(1) (Regardless of the nature of the action or claim ). The prefatory clause, however, does not purport to expand the scope of § 1252(f)(1)'s restriction, it simply makes clear that the restriction must apply to all claims that would otherwise fall within it, without exception. See Atlantic Richfield Co., 590 U. S., at ___, n. 5, 140 S.Ct., at 1350, n. 5 (reasoning similarly as to phrase `without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy').",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,105,"The Court closes with two policy arguments. It deems it most unlikely that Congress would enact a statute that disproportionately limits lower courts' authority to issue injunctive relief to remedy constitutional claims, a result it contends would flow from respondents' reading. Ante, at 2066-2067. This is in large part a problem of the Court's own making. As explained, a proper interpretation of § 1252(f)(1)'s saving clause preserves lower courts' authority to issue injunctive relief on constitutional claims, including on a classwide basis, so long as all plaintiffs are individuals against whom removal proceedings have been initiated. Moreover, even in preenforcement challenges brought by entities or by individuals not in removal proceedings, respondents' reading of § 1252(f)(1) does not prohibit injunctive relief exclusively as to constitutional  claims, but also as to claims that arise from any statutes external to the covered INA provisions (for example, a claim that a covered provision violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)). See ante, at 2067, n. 4. The correct reading of § 1252(f)(1) evenhandedly protects the specified INA provisions from all such external, preenforcement, lower court injunctions, whether on statutory or constitutional grounds, without shielding unlawful agency action inconsistent with the specified provisions. Whatever the Court may think of the wisdom of that policy, it is a perfectly plausible one.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,106,"The Court also worries that under this reading of § 1252(f)(1), the inquiry as to whether injunctive relief is available may overlap with the merits of a claim that a covered provision has been violated. Ante, at 2066-2068. The Court is wrong to find anything unusual about that consequence. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011). Even as to the question of subject-matter jurisdiction (as opposed to the remedial authority at issue here), the necessity of touching aspects of the merits  is a familiar feature of litigation. Id., at 351-352, 131 S.Ct. 2541, accord, e.g., Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., 582 U. S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 1975, 1986, 198 L.Ed.2d 527 (2017) (The distinction between jurisdictional and merits issues is not inevitably sharp, for the two inquiries may overlap). Any overlap may be substantial: Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, for instance, all elements of a meritorious claim are also jurisdictional. Brownback v. King, 592 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 740, 749, 209 L.Ed.2d 33 (2021).6 This concern, too, offers no justification for the Court's departure from ordinary meaning or its disregard of clear contextual evidence contrary to its view.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,108,"The Court's arguments in support of its reading of the saving clause fare little better. The Court opens with language from past cases suggesting support for its interpretation. See ante, at 2064-2065. None of the cases the Court quotes, however, presented or decided the scope of § 1252(f)(1)'s bar on injunctive relief.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,109,"The Court next affords dispositive weight to its class-exclusive view of the word individual in § 1252(f)(1). See ante, at 2065. The Court distinguishes Califano in a footnote, asserting that § 1252(f)(1)'s saving clause should be construed narrowly because it is an exception to the primary clause. See ante, at 2068, n. 6. The point, however, is not that the statute interpreted in Califano was identical to § 1252(f)(1), but that Califano established that a statute's mere use of the word individual does not suffice to preclude classwide relief. Moreover, the Court overlooks that it is § 1252(f)(1)'s primary clause (which divests lower courts of their `traditional equitable authority') that constitutes an exception to the norm. McQuiggin, 569 U.S. at 397, 133 S.Ct. 1924. The Court ignores the clear-statement rule for such displacements of courts' equitable jurisdiction. Califano and the clear-statement rule both instruct that  Congress would not have done so much so obliquely, particularly when it clearly prohibited class relief in another subsection of the same statute.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,110,"On the question of Congress' disparate inclusion and exclusion of language in § 1252 referring to class actions, the Court declines to decide what it thinks. Taking one path, it suggests that one should not give much weight to this negative inference. Ante, at 2068. But see Nken, 556 U.S. at 430-431, 129 S.Ct. 1749 (giving weight to equivalent inference when interpreting same statute). Taking another, the Court admits that adhering to its holding might well rule out efforts to obtain any injunctive relief that applies to multiple named plaintiffs (or perhaps even rule out injunctive relief in a lawsuit brought by multiple named plaintiffs). Ante, at 2068. That result, which would require separate remedial orders or even separate lawsuits for family members asserting legally and factually identical claims based on joint immigration applications or proceedings, is absurd. There is no conceivable benefit in requiring identical claims to be raised in separate, duplicative actions. This bizarre outcome offers further proof that the Court has erred.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,112,The ramifications of the Court's errors should not be ignored. Today's holding risks depriving many vulnerable noncitizens of any meaningful opportunity to protect their rights.,Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,113,"To understand why, consider the practical realities of the removal and detention system. Noncitizens subjected to removal proceedings are disproportionately unlikely to be familiar with the U. S. legal system or fluent in the English language. Even so, these individuals must navigate the Nation's labyrinthine immigration laws without entitlement to appointed counsel or legal support. If they are detained, like respondents here, they face particularly daunting hurdles. On average, immigration detention facilities are located significantly farther away from detained individuals' communities and court proceedings than criminal jails, making it extraordinarily difficult to secure legal representation. Even for those individuals who can locate and afford counsel under these circumstances, such remote confinement impedes evidence gathering and communication with counsel. After traveling (perhaps for hours) to meet with detained clients, attorneys may be barred from doing so due to logistical or administrative errors, legal phone calls, too, frequently are nonconfidential, prohibitively costly, or otherwise unavailable. Exacerbating these challenges, the Government regularly transfers detained noncitizens between facilities, often multiple times.7",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,114,"It is one matter to expect noncitizens facing these obstacles to defend against their removal in immigration court. It is  another entirely to place upon each of them the added burden of contesting systemic violations of their rights through discrete, collateral, federal-court proceedings. In a great many cases, the inevitable consequence of barring classwide injunctive relief will be that those violations will go unremedied, except as to the few fortunate enough to afford competent collateral counsel or to secure vigorous pro bono representation. The burdens will fall on those least able to vindicate their rights, as well as the law firms and nonprofit organizations that will endeavor to assist as many of these noncitizens as their capacity permits.8",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,115,"If, somehow, a substantial number of noncitizens are able to overcome these obstacles and file separate federal lawsuits against unlawful removal or detention policies, a different problem will arise. Class litigation not only enables individual class members to enforce their rights against powerful actors, but also advances judicial economy by eliminating the need for duplicative proceedings pertaining to each class member. In contrast, the Court's overbroad reading of § 1252(f)(1) forces noncitizens facing unlawful detention, if they are able, to flood district court dockets with individual habeas actions raising materially indistinguishable claims and requesting materially indistinguishable injunctive relief. Brief for Retired Federal Judges as Amici Curiae 15. There is no reason to think Congress intended either of these untenable results.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,116,"In fairness, the Court's decision is not without limits. For instance, the Court does not purport to hold that § 1252(f)(1) affects courts' ability to hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). No such claim is raised here. In addition, the Court rightly does not embrace the Government's eleventh-hour suggestion at oral argument to hold that § 1252(f)(1) bars even classwide declaratory relief,9 a suggestion that would (if accepted) leave many noncitizens  with no practical remedy whatsoever against clear violations by the Executive Branch.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-022,117,"Even with these limits, however, the repercussions of today's decision will be grave. In view of the text and context of § 1252(f)(1), these repercussions offer yet more evidence that the Court's interpretive effort has gone badly astray.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

2021-023,31,"Federal courts have a very limited role to play in this process. With an exception for legal and constitutional questions, Congress has barred judicial review of the Attorney General's decisions denying discretionary relief from removal. We must decide how far this bar extends—specifically, whether it precludes judicial review of factual findings that underlie a denial of relief. It does.",Barrett,0,

If an immigration judge decides that a noncitizen is removable, the judge is authorized to order the removal of the noncitizen from the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5).",Barrett,0,
2021-023,35,"Being found removable is not always the end of the story, though, because Congress has authorized relief from removal in certain contexts. For example, the Attorney General has discretion to adjust the status of an eligible noncitizen who entered the United States illegally to that of lawful permanent resident, forgiving the illegal entry and protecting the noncitizen from removal on that ground. See § 1255(i). (As with authority over removal generally, the Attorney General has delegated to immigration judges the ability to grant relief from removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(a)(1)(ii).) To be eligible for such relief, a noncitizen must show that he satisfies various threshold requirements established by Congress. Yet eligibility only gets a noncitizen so far. Because relief from removal is always `a matter of grace,' even an eligible noncitizen must persuade the immigration judge that he merits a favorable exercise of discretion. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 308, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). And if the judge decides that denial would be appropriate regardless of eligibility, the judge need not address eligibility at all.

2021-023,41,"Pankajkumar Patel and his wife Jyotsnaben entered the United States illegally in the 1990s. In 2007, Patel applied to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)) for adjustment of status under § 1255(i). See 8 C.F.R. § 245.2(a)(1) (giving USCIS authority over applications for adjustment of status made outside of removal proceedings). If granted, this adjustment would have excused Patel's illegal entry and made him a lawful permanent resident. (Patel's wife, the other petitioner in this case, applied for derivative adjustment of status based on Patel's application.) While his request to USCIS was pending, Patel also applied for a Georgia driver's license. On that application, he checked a box falsely stating that he was a United States citizen.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,42,"USCIS denied Patel's application for adjustment of status because of that misrepresentation. One of the eligibility requirements for adjustment is that the noncitizen be statutorily admissible for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(2)(A). USCIS decided that Patel failed to satisfy this requirement. Section 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) renders inadmissible an alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself or herself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under state or federal law. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has interpreted this provision to apply when a noncitizen (1) makes a false representation of citizenship (2) that is material to a purpose or benefit under the law (3) with the subjective intent of obtaining the purpose or benefit. Matter of Richmond, 26 I. & N. Dec. 779, 786-787 (2016). Applying this test, USCIS concluded that Patel had violated § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) and was therefore ineligible for status adjustment.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,43,"Several years later, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Patels because they were present in the United States without having been admitted—the same illegal entry that Patel had sought to remedy in his initial application for adjustment of status.

2021-023,44,"Now before an Immigration Judge, Patel's request for relief raised the same question that had been at issue in his application before USCIS: whether the misrepresentation of citizenship on his driver's license application rendered him ineligible for discretionary adjustment. He conceded that he had checked the citizen box on that application. But he argued that he had done so by accident—and therefore without the subjective intent that the BIA has interpreted § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) to require.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,45,"The Immigration Judge concluded otherwise. The judge explained that Patel was evasive when asked exactly how he had made a mistake. And though Patel testified that he had provided his alien registration number on his application, which would have identified him as a noncitizen, the actual application showed that he had not. The judge also noted that Patel had falsely represented his manner of entry into the United States on an application for asylum. Based on this evidence, the judge found that Patel's testimony was not credible and that he had intentionally represented that he was a citizen. The judge accordingly denied Patel's application for adjustment of status and ordered that he and his wife be removed from the United States. Patel appealed the decision to the BIA, which determined that the judge's factual findings were not clearly erroneous and dismissed the appeal.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,46,"Patel petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for review, arguing that any reasonable judge would have been compelled to conclude that his testimony was credible and that he had made an honest mistake on the form. See § 1252(b)(4)(B) (Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary). A panel of that court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Patel's claim because federal law prohibits judicial review of any judgment regarding the granting of relief under § 1255, the adjustment-of-status provision. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). And the factual determinations of which Patel sought review— whether he had testified credibly and whether he had subjectively intended to misrepresent himself as a citizen—each qualified, in the panel's view, as a judgment regarding the granting of relief.

2021-023,52,"Amicus maintains that judgment means any authoritative decision. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1223 (1993) (a formal utterance or pronouncing of an authoritative opinion after judging, or an opinion so pronounced), 8 Oxford English Dictionary 294 (2d ed. 1989) (the pronouncing of a deliberate opinion upon a person or thing, or the opinion pronounced). Under this broad definition, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)'s prohibition encompasses any and all decisions relating to the granting or denying of discretionary relief. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 22-23. Factual findings fall within this category, amicus says, so the courts lack jurisdiction to review them.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,53,"The Government argues that, at least when used outside the context of a final judgment of a court, judgment does not refer to just any decision. According to the  Government, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)'s use of judgment refers exclusively to a decision that requires the use of discretion. Brief for Respondent 16-18. On this approach, some eligibility determinations are reviewable and others are not. For example, the determination that a noncitizen's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship for a spouse, parent, or child involves discretion (which makes it an unreviewable judgment), but the decision that an applicant has fewer than 10 years of continuous presence in the United States does not (which makes it reviewable). See id., at 42 (citing 971 F.3d at 1296 (Martin, J., dissenting)), but see Trejo v. Garland, 3 F.4th 760 (CA5 2021) (concluding to the contrary that hardship is nondiscretionary and so reviewable), Singh v. Rosen, 984 F.3d 1142 (CA6 2021) (same). The Government classifies the factual findings at issue in this case—the Immigration Judge's conclusions that Patel's testimony was not credible and that he had lied on the form—as nondiscretionary and therefore outside the jurisdictional bar.2",Barrett,0,
2021-023,54,"Patel agrees with the Government that judgment implies an exercise of discretion, but unlike the Government, he would not sift through eligibility determinations to classify them as discretionary or nondiscretionary. Instead, Patel reads the phrase regarding the granting of relief to focus the jurisdictional bar narrowly on a single discretionary judgment: the immigration judge's decision whether to grant relief to an applicant eligible to receive it. Everything else, Patel says, is reviewable. Justice GORSUCH adopts Patel's approach, rejecting the Government's interpretation as well as amicus'. See post, at 1631 (dissenting opinion).",Barrett,0,
2021-023,56,"Amicus' interpretation is the only one that fits § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)'s text and context. The provision does not restrict itself to certain kinds of decisions. Rather, it prohibits review of any judgment regarding the granting of relief under § 1255 and the other enumerated provisions. As this Court has repeatedly explained, `the word `any' has an expansive meaning.' Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, 140 S.Ct. 1168, 1173 n. 2, 206 L.Ed.2d 432 (2020), see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 97 (defining any as one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind). Here, any means that the provision applies to judgments `of whatever kind' under § 1255, not just discretionary judgments or the last-in-time judgment. See United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997). Similarly, the use of regarding in a legal context generally has a broadening effect, ensuring that the scope of a provision covers not only its subject but also matters relating to that subject. Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1752, 1760, 201 L.Ed.2d 102 (2018), see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 1911 (defining regarding as with respect to or concerning). Thus, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) encompasses not just the granting of relief but also any judgment relating to the granting of relief. That plainly includes factual findings.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,57,"Section 1252(a)(2)(D), which preserves review of constitutional claims and questions of law, reinforces that conclusion. Congress added this subparagraph after we suggested in St. Cyr that barring review of all legal questions in removal cases could raise a constitutional concern. See 533 U.S., at 300, 314, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The amendment is precise. While Congress could have responded to St. Cyr by lifting § 1252's prohibitions on judicial review altogether, it instead excised only the legal and constitutional questions that implicated our concern. See § 1252(a)(2)(D) (Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C) or other similar provisions shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law), §§ 1252(a)(2)(B), (C) (continuing to prohibit review except as provided in subparagraph (D)). And if Congress made such questions an exception, it must have left something within the rule. The major remaining category is questions of fact.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,58,"No surprise, then, that we have already relied on subparagraph (D) to all but settle that judicial review of factfinding is unavailable. In Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U. S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 1062, 206 L.Ed.2d 271 (2020), we had to decide whether subparagraph (C)—which bars review of any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain criminal offenses—prohibits review of how a legal standard applies to undisputed facts. Our answer turned on whether such an application counts as a question of law for purposes of subparagraph (D). Id., at ___-___, 140 S.Ct., at 1067-69. In holding that it does, we explained that subparagraph (D) will still forbid appeals of factual determinations themselves under subparagraph (C). Id., at ___-___, 140 S.Ct., at 1072-73. Had we thought otherwise, we would simply have said that questions of fact, like questions of law, are reviewable—end of story.",Barrett,0,

There, we held that a court has jurisdiction to review a factual challenge to an order denying relief under the Convention Against Torture, because that order falls outside of subparagraph (C)'s prohibition on reviewing final orders of removal. In reaching that conclusion, we emphasized that our decision would have no effect on those orders that do fall within a jurisdiction-stripping provision—including orders denying discretionary relief under § 1252(a)(2)(B). Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1693. And so, we explained, a noncitizen may not bring a factual challenge to orders denying discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. Ibid. We adhere to that view today.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,61,"In contrast to amicus' straightforward interpretation, both the Government's and Patel's arguments read like elaborate efforts to avoid the most natural meaning of the text.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,63,"We begin with the Government's argument that judgment refers exclusively to a discretionary decision, which the Government describes as a decision that is subjective or evaluative. Brief for Respondent 12. According to the Government, this requirement is evident in definitions like this one: `the mental or intellectual process of forming an opinion or evaluation by discerning and comparing,' or `an opinion or estimate so formed.' Id., at 16-17 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 1223). The Government's argument is subtle, to say the least, given that none of the definitions it cites expressly  references discretion. Evidently, the nature of the decisionmaking process does the work: If the process occurs as the definitions describe, then the decision it yields is discretionary and counts as a judgment. And the Government says that the factual findings in this case do not fit that description.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,64,"We do not see how the Government's cited definitions narrow the field in the way that the Government claims. Rather than delineating a special category of discretionary determinations, they simply describe the decisionmaking process. That process might involve a matter that the Government treats as subjective or one that it deems objective. Either counts as a judgment, even under the definitions that the Government offers.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,65,"Take the credibility determination at issue in this case. It is easily described as an opinion or evaluation formed by discerning and comparing the evidence presented. The Immigration Judge weighed Patel's testimony, reviewed documents, and considered Patel's history to conclude that he was an evasive and untrustworthy witness. Using the word judgment to describe that kind of credibility determination is perfectly natural—in fact, we have used it this way ourselves. See, e.g., Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 327, 135 S.Ct. 831, 190 L.Ed.2d 719 (2015) (discussing `credibility judgments' about a witness). It is just as natural in other factfinding contexts, like the Immigration Judge's determination that Patel lied on his driver's license application. Finding that fact involved the same exercise of evaluating conflicting evidence to make a judgment about what happened.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,66,"So to succeed, the Government must do more than point to the word judgment. It must show that in context, the kind of judgment to which § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) refers is discretionary. But the text of the provision stops that argument in its tracks because the bar on review applies to any judgment. Had Congress intended instead to limit the jurisdictional bar to discretionary judgments, it could easily have used that language—as it did elsewhere in the immigration code. See, e.g., § 1226(e) (The Attorney General's discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review (emphasis added)), § 1252(b)(4)(D) (The Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to grant relief under section 1158(a) of this title shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion (emphasis added)). We express no view about what discretionary judgment means in those provisions —the point is simply that the absence of any reference to discretion in § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) undercuts the Government's efforts to read it in.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,67,"The Government claims that Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010), which interpreted neighboring provision § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), supports its argument. That provision bars review of",Barrett,0,
2021-023,68,"any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,69,"We explained in Kucana that the proximity of clauses (i) and (ii), and the words linking them—`any other decision'—suggest that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Id., at 246-247, 130 S.Ct. 827. Read harmoniously, we said, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of discretionary decisions  only when Congress itself set out the Attorney General's discretionary authority in the statute. Id., at 247, 130 S.Ct. 827. This reference to barring review of discretionary decisions, the Government says, implies that review of nondiscretionary decisions is allowed.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,70,"Kucana's discussion is inapposite. That opinion addressed whether the Attorney General could unilaterally proscribe review of decisions declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation. Id., at 237, 130 S.Ct. 827. In drawing the comparison between clauses (i) and (ii), we thus focused on the fact that each form of relief identified in clause (i) was entrusted to the Attorney General's discretion by statute. Id., at 246, 130 S.Ct. 827. We neither said nor implied anything about review of eligibility decisions made in the course of exercising that statutory discretion.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,71,"In short, the Government is wrong about both text and context. A judgment does not necessarily involve discretion, nor does context indicate that only discretionary judgments are covered by § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).",Barrett,0,
2021-023,73,"Unlike the Government, Patel interprets § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) to prohibit review of only the ultimate grant or denial of relief, leaving all eligibility determinations reviewable. That, Patel says, is because the provision specifies the kind of judgment to which the bar applies: any judgment regarding the granting of relief. Eligibility determinations—which Patel characterizes as first-step decisions—are not judgments regarding the granting of relief because eligibility is a necessary but insufficient condition for relief. The only judgment that can actually grant relief is what Patel describes as the second-step decision whether to grant the applicant the `grace' of relief from removal. Brief for Petitioners 20 (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 308, 121 S.Ct. 2271). So, Patel argues, that is the sole judgment to which the bar applies.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,74,"Like the Government, Patel cannot square his interpretation with the text of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). He claims that his is the only interpretation that makes sense of regarding the granting of relief, as he sees it, any judgment regarding the granting of relief must narrow the meaning of judgment to include only the decision whether to grant relief. Brief for Petitioners 22-25, 37-39. To be sure, the reference to the granting of relief appears to constrain the provision from sweeping in judgments that have nothing to do with that subject. But as even the Government acknowledges, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) does not stop at just the grant or denial of relief, it extends to any judgment regarding that ultimate decision. See Brief for Respondent 18-20. Patel's interpretation to the contrary reads regarding out of the statute entirely.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,75,"Context further undermines Patel's position. He cannot explain why the bar in subparagraph (B) should be read differently from subparagraph (C)'s prohibition on reviewing final orders of removal for certain criminal offenses. Patel acknowledges that this bar on review of a final order also precludes review of its factual support, including the very kind of factfinding at issue in this case. Reply Brief for Petitioners 7, Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U. S., at ___-___, 140 S.Ct., at 1072-73. But if Congress had wanted to achieve that effect in subparagraph (B), he argues, it could have used final order there too, rather than judgment. Reply Brief for Petitioners 7. Yet Patel ignores a simple explanation for the shift in terminology. Subparagraph (B) bars review of only one facet of the removal process (consideration of discretionary  relief) whereas subparagraph (C) prohibits review of the entire proceeding (removal based on a criminal offense). Each statutory label describes its target, but otherwise, the provisions preclude judicial review in the same way and bear the same relationship to subparagraph (D). Given those similarities, we see no reason to think that subparagraph (B) would allow a court to review the factual underpinnings of a decision when subparagraph (C) prohibits just that.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,77,"Patel and the Government object that our interpretation of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) would arbitrarily prohibit review of some factual determinations made in the discretionary-relief context that would be reviewable if made elsewhere in removal proceedings. In this case, for example, the question whether Patel intended to falsely claim to be a citizen on his driver's license application relates to whether he is statutorily inadmissible, which is both an obstacle to discretionary relief and an independent ground for removal. Presumably because Patel openly acknowledged that he was removable for entering the country illegally, the Government did not premise his removal on the contested claim that he had intentionally misrepresented his citizenship. But if the Government had taken that route, the Immigration Judge's determinations would have been reviewable in the ordinary course.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,78,"That distinction is not arbitrary. It reflects Congress' choice to provide reduced procedural protection for discretionary relief, the granting of which is `not a matter of right under any circumstances, but rather is in all cases a matter of grace.' St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 308, 121 S.Ct. 2271. That reduced protection is reflected in the burden of proof too: The Government bears the burden of proving removability by clear and convincing evidence, while an applicant bears the burden of establishing eligibility for discretionary relief. Compare § 1229a(c)(3)(A) with § 1229a(c)(4)(A). For both judicial review and the burden of proof, the context in which a fact is found explains the difference in protection afforded.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,79,"Patel and the Government also briefly suggest that interpreting § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) as we do will have the unintended consequence of precluding all review of USCIS denials of discretionary relief. Those decisions are made outside of the removal context, and subparagraph (D) preserves review of legal and constitutional questions only when raised in a petition for review of a final order of removal. If the jurisdictional bar is broad and subparagraph (D) is inapplicable, Patel and the Government say, USCIS decisions will be wholly insulated from judicial review.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,80,"The reviewability of such decisions is not before us, and we do not decide it. But it is possible that Congress did, in fact, intend to close that door.3 The post-St. Cyr amendments expressly extended the jurisdictional bar to judgments made outside of removal proceedings at the same time that they preserved review of legal and constitutional questions made within removal proceedings. See §§ 1252(a)(2)(B), (D). And foreclosing judicial review unless and until removal proceedings are initiated would be consistent  with Congress' choice to reduce procedural protections in the context of discretionary relief. See Lee v. USCIS, 592 F.3d 612, 620 (CA4 2010) (To the extent Congress decided to permit judicial review of a constitutional or legal issue bearing upon the denial of adjustment of status, it intended for the issue to be raised to the court of appeals during removal proceedings). So it would be difficult to maintain that this consequence conflicts with the statutory structure, and neither Patel nor the Government goes so far. Instead, they urge us to interpret § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) to avoid the risk of this result. Yet we inevitably swerve out of our lane when we put policy considerations in the driver's seat. As we have emphasized many times before, policy concerns cannot trump the best interpretation of the statutory text. See, e.g., Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1474, 1486, 209 L.Ed.2d 433 (2021), Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 357, 76 S.Ct. 919, 100 L.Ed. 1242 (1956).",Barrett,0,
2021-023,82,"As a last resort, Patel and the Government insist that the statute is ambiguous enough to trigger the presumption that Congress did not intend to foreclose judicial review. We disagree.",Barrett,0,
2021-023,83,"Because `executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review,' Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1069, we presume that review is available when a statute is silent. See Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 56, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993). But that presumption may be overcome by specific language in a provision or evidence drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole. Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340, 349, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984). And as we have explained in detail, the text and context of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)— which is, after all, a jurisdiction-stripping statute—clearly indicate that judicial review of fact determinations is precluded in the discretionary-relief context. The plain meaning of that provision, not any interpretative presumption, drives our conclusion today. Because the statute is clear, we have no reason to resort to the presumption of reviewability.* * *",Barrett,0,

S. citizen, and two who are lawful permanent residents and spouses of U. S. citizens. As a young man, Mr. Patel entered the country illegally. But in 2007, he tried to make things right by applying for an adjustment of his immigration status to a lawful permanent resident (also known as a green card).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,92,"Mr. Patel had at least some reason to hope. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) expressly authorizes the Attorney General to grant relief in cases like his. The statute sets forth a two-step process. At the first step, the government must determine if an individual is statutorily eligible for an adjustment of status. Various circumstances specified by law, including prior criminal convictions, may render an applicant ineligible for relief. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255(i)(2)(A), 1182. At the second step, once an individual has established his statutory eligibility for relief, the Attorney General or his designee is entitled to grant or deny an adjustment of status in his discretion. §§ 1255(a), (i)(2), see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(a) (2021) (delegating this authority to immigration judges). Because this second step is discretionary, mere eligibility for relief does not automatically result in a grant of the application. Matter of Arai, 13 I. & N. Dec. 494, 495 (BIA 1970). Instead, the actual granting of relief  is in all cases a matter of grace. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 308, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,93,"Seeking relief under this scheme, Mr. Patel filed an application with the necessary paperwork. Soon, the government responded by returning a document allowing Mr. Patel to continue to work and remain in the country while it processed his application. So far, so good.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,94,"But then a problem emerged. Several months after filing his application, Mr. Patel sought to renew his Georgia driver's license. When filling out the renewal form, Mr. Patel answered the question Are you a U. S. citizen? by checking a box that said yes. After discovering Mr. Patel's erroneous checkmark, Georgia authorities charged him with willfully falsifying his driver's license application. Later, however, the State dropped its prosecution after concluding it lacked sufficient evidence to prove a crime. Not only has Mr. Patel consistently claimed that he intended to deceive no one and that he simply ticked the wrong box by mistake. Under Georgia law, Mr. Patel was eligible to receive a license without being a citizen because he had a pending application seeking lawful permanent residence and a valid employment authorization document. See Ga. Comp. Rules & Regs., Rules 375-3-1.02(3)(e), (7) (2022).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,95,"Apparently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) saw things differently. Operating through United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency denied Mr. Patel's application for adjustment of status, citing his faulty driver's license application. According to USCIS, Mr. Patel's conduct rendered him statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under a provision that  excludes any alien who falsely represents himself  to be a citizen of the United States to obtain a benefit under  State law. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), 1255(i)(2)(A). On USCIS's view, Mr. Patel's application for adjustment of status failed at the first step—and the Attorney General was wholly without discretion to afford him relief at the second.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,97,"Some months later, the government elected to bring removal proceedings against Mr. Patel. As a defense to removal, Mr. Patel renewed his application for adjustment of status consistent with regulations permitting him to do so. See 8 C.F.R. § 245.2(a)(5)(ii). At his removal hearing, Mr. Patel repeated points he had made to state officials, insisting that he had harbored no intent to deceive anyone, and submitting that he remained statutorily eligible for relief. See Matter of Richmond, 26 I. & N. Dec. 779, 784 (BIA 2016) (inadmissibility is triggered when a misrepresentation is made with the subjective intent of obtaining  benefits (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,98,"None of this moved the immigration judge. Relevant here, the immigration judge rested his decision on a factual finding. He said he did not believe Mr. Patel's testimony that he checked the wrong box mistakenly. Instead, the immigration judge found, Mr. Patel intentionally represented himself falsely to obtain a benefit under state law. According to the immigration judge, Mr. Patel had a strong incentive to deceive state officials because he could not have obtained a Georgia driver's license if he had disclosed he was neither a citizen nor a lawful permanent resident. And because intentionally deceiving state officials to obtain a benefit is enough to render an applicant statutorily ineligible for relief at step one, the immigration judge concluded, there was no need to reach the second-step question whether Mr. Patel warranted a favorable exercise of discretion.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,99,"Mr. Patel appealed the immigration judge's ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). In his appeal, Mr. Patel argued that the immigration judge's finding that he had an incentive to deceive state officials was simply wrong—under Georgia law he was entitled to a driver's license without being a citizen or a lawful permanent resident given his pending application for adjustment of status and permission to work. Mr. Patel submitted, too, that all the record evidence pointed to the conclusion he simply checked the wrong box by mistake, even state officials agreed they had no case to bring against him for deception. In the end, however, a divided panel of the BIA rejected the appeal by a vote of 2 to 1.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,100,"Mr. Patel next petitioned for review in the Eleventh Circuit. There, he argued that the BIA's finding that he intentionally sought to deceive state officials was wholly unreasonable given the evidence before the agency. In response, the federal government agreed that the Eleventh Circuit had the power to hear Mr. Patel's case but asked the court to affirm the BIA's decision on the merits. Instead, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit charted its own path, holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's factual findings no matter how wrong they might be. See Patel v. United States Atty. Gen., 917 F.3d 1319, 1324 (2019). Eventually, the full court agreed to rehear the case and, by a vote of 9 to 5, reached the same conclusion. See Patel v. United States Atty. Gen., 971 F.3d 1258 (2020). In doing so, the court acknowledged that it had to overrule numerous circuit precedents holding that it possessed the power to review cases like Mr. Patel's.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,101,"Id., at 1262. It acknowledged, too, that its new ruling conflicted with the holdings of most other courts of appeals. Id., at 1277, and n. 22.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,103,"As it comes to us, this case poses the question: Does a federal court have statutory authority to review and correct a BIA decision holding an individual ineligible for relief when that decision rests on a glaring factual error? Today, the majority insists the answer is no. It does not matter if the BIA and immigration judge in Mr. Patel's case erred badly when they found he harbored an intent to deceive state officials. It does not matter if the BIA declares other individuals ineligible for relief based on even more obvious factual errors. On the majority's telling, courts are powerless to correct bureaucratic mistakes like these no matter how grave they may be.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,104,"It is an eye-catching conclusion. Normally in this country, federal courts shoulder the responsibility of reviewing agency decisions to ensure they are at least supported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(E). A similar, if surely more deferential, principle finds voice in the INA. As relevant here, that statute endows federal courts of appeals with the power to review all questions of law and fact  arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). And the law further provides that a court may reject the agency's factual findings underlying an order of removal if it concludes that no reasonable adjudicator could adopt them. § 1252(b)(4)(B), see also Garland v. Ming Dai, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1669, 1677, 210 L.Ed.2d 11 (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,105,"That is exactly the sort of argument Mr. Patel seeks to pursue. He hopes to persuade a court of law that the BIA's factual errors in his case are so obvious no reasonable factfinder could adopt them. It is a claim expressly permitted by statute. Tellingly, in the proceedings before us the government has continued to maintain that, however his case is finally resolved, Mr. Patel is entitled to his day in court. Nor is this some new position. For at least 20 years the government has taken the view that the law permits judicial review in cases like these. Yet even in the face of all this, the majority balks. It holds that no court may entertain Mr. Patel's challenge. And its reasoning promises that countless future immigrants will be left with no avenue to correct even more egregious agency errors.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,107,"How does the majority manage to reach such an unlikely conclusion? It depends on a Court-appointed amicus who offers arguments for the government that even the government refuses to advance on its own behalf. It turns out, too, that all of those arguments hinge on a narrow exception to the usual rule of judicial review—one found in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). As relevant here, that exception reads:",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,108,Denials of discretionary relief,Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,109,"Notwithstanding any other provision of law  and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review—(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section  1255 of this title.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,110,"This language does not begin to do the work the majority demands of it. Recall that requests for adjustment of status involve a two-step process. First, the Attorney General, acting through the BIA, must determine whether an individual is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255(a), (i). If so, the Attorney General may proceed to the second step  and decide whether to grant an adjustment request in his discretion. §§ 1255(a), (i)(2)(A). Undoubtedly, the exception in § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) creates a special rule insulating from judicial review the second and purely discretionary decision. But nothing in it disturbs the general rule that courts may entertain challenges to the BIA's factual findings and legal analysis associated with its first-step eligibility determination.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,111,"This much follows directly from the statute's terms. Subparagraph (B)(i) renders unreviewable only those judgments regarding the granting of relief. That phrase has a well-understood meaning. To grant relief is to supply redress or benefit. United States v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 909, 129 S.Ct. 2213, 173 L.Ed.2d 1235 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). And where, as here, the BIA issues a judgment only at step one, it never reaches the question whether to grant relief or supply some redress or benefit. Instead, the agency resolves only the antecedent question whether an individual is statutorily eligible to petition for relief, redress, or a benefit. As the BIA has explained, a judgment at step one can never result in a grant of the application. Arai, 13 I. & N. Dec. at 495. Any judgment regarding the granting of relief comes only at step two where the INA expressly vests the Attorney General with substantial discretion. See St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 307, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (noting the traditional and longstanding distinction between eligibility for discretionary relief, on the one hand, and the favorable exercise of discretion, on the other hand (emphasis added)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,112,"All of which leads us back to Mr. Patel's case. Before the Eleventh Circuit, Mr. Patel sought to challenge the BIA's step-one determination that he was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status, arguing that no reasonable adjudicator could have found the facts as the agency did. The INA expressly authorizes courts to hear claims like his. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Unprompted, however, the Eleventh Circuit held that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) effectively undoes this arrangement. That court's self-directed legal analysis was mistaken. Subparagraph (B)(i) only deprives courts of jurisdiction to review the Attorney General's step-two discretionary decision to grant or deny relief, not the BIA's step-one judgments regarding whether an individual is eligible to be considered for such relief.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,114,"The majority, of course, offers a different view. Following the Eleventh Circuit's lead, the majority contends that subparagraph (B)(i)'s phrase any judgment regarding the granting of relief under § 1255 sweeps more broadly. On its account, the statute denies courts the power to correct all agency decisions with respect to an adjustment-of-status application under § 1255—both the agency's step-one eligibility decisions and its step-two discretionary decisions. Ante, at 1622-1623. As a result, no court may correct even the agency's most egregious factual mistakes about an individual's statutory eligibility for relief. It is a novel reading of a 25-year-old statute. One at odds with background law permitting judicial review. And one even the government disavows.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,115,"It is easy to see why. We do not normally suppose that Congress blithely includes words in its laws that perform no work. See, e.g., Liu v. SEC, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1936, 1948, 207 L.Ed.2d 401 (2020) (noting the `cardinal principle of interpretation that courts must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute'). Yet that is exactly what the majority's interpretation requires of us. If subparagraph (B)(i) operated as the majority  imagines, Congress would have had no need to deny courts jurisdiction over any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1255. Instead, Congress could have simply omitted the italicized words and denied jurisdiction over any judgment under section 1255. Plainly, all those additional words must do something. And the work they perform is clear—the phrase directs us to the Attorney General's second-step discretionary judgment to grant relief. That alone is a judgment regarding the granting of relief. And under the statute's terms, that judgment alone is shielded from judicial review.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,116,"The majority's attempt to resolve its surplusage problem only underscores the gravity of its error. First, the majority tells us that, as used in subparagraph (B)(i), the words any judgment mean any authoritative decision. Ante, at 1621-1622, 1622. Then the majority tells us that the phrase regarding the granting of relief expands the universe of covered judgments further, because the word regarding `generally has a broadening effect.' Ante, at 1622. But how could that be? Under the majority's reading of the word judgment, the statute already precludes judicial review of any authoritative decision under section 1255. There is no further corner of the universe left to explore. Once more, the words regarding the granting of relief are left without work to perform. Rather than sort out its surplusage problem, the majority's answer only highlights its bind.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,117,"What is more, the majority's argument rests on a faulty premise. The majority insists that the word regarding has a broadening effect. Ibid. It even suggests that failing to give the term that effect would be to read it out of the statute entirely. Ante, at 1625. But in truth, the word can have either a broadening or narrowing effect depending on context. Cf. Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015) (plurality opinion) (In law as in life  the same words, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things). And in subparagraph (B)(i), regarding is much more likely to serve a narrowing function, focusing our attention on a specific subset of judgments—namely, those step-two discretionary judgments regarding the granting of relief.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,118,"To appreciate the point, consider a hypothetical. Imagine I said: Please bring me any book regarding the history of the American West from that shelf of history books. In this sentence, the phrase regarding the history of the American West does not broaden the referenced set. Instead, it directs you to a narrow subset of books: those regarding the history of the American West. Any other interpretation misses the point and leaves me with a pile of unwanted volumes.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,119,"What is true of this hypothetical is true of subparagraph (B)(i). The phrase regarding the granting of relief does not expand the set—again, the sentence already speaks of any judgment  under section  1255. Instead, it functions as limiting language that narrows the kind of judgments under § 1255 the command means to cover. iTech U. S., Inc. v. Renaud, 5 F.4th 59, 65 (CADC 2021). And here that means limiting our attention to the agency's step-two decision, the only place where it can issue a judgment regarding the granting of relief. Any other reading renders the statute a garble.1  III",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,121,"To the extent doubt remains about the proper construction of subparagraph (B)(i), it dissipates quickly with a look to the larger statutory context. Here the clues are many—yet the majority pauses to consider almost none of them.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,122,"Take first a neighboring statutory provision. After denying courts the power to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief in subparagraph (B)(i), Congress proceeded in the very next clause to deny courts jurisdiction to entertain another category of cases: any other decision  the authority for which is specified  to be in the discretion of the Attorney General. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). That phrasing has a clear implication: The proximity of clauses (i) and (ii), and the words linking them—`any other decision'—suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 246-247, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). And as we have seen, the only judgment under § 1255 that fits that description is the Attorney General's second-step decision to grant or deny adjustment of status in his discretion. §§ 1255(a), (i)(2), see also St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 308, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (noting that second-step decisions to grant relief are a matter of grace).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,123,"Next, consider the other statutes subparagraph (B)(i) addresses. It doesn't just bar review of judgments regarding the granting of relief under § 1255 for adjustment of status. Subparagraph (B)(i) also bars review of judgments regarding the granting of relief under sections 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, and 1229c. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). These provisions bear many differences. But they all have one thing in common: a two-step structure in which the Attorney General makes a statutory determination, followed by a step-two discretionary decision whether to grant relief.2 That hardly seems a coincidence. More likely, it is further indication that subparagraph (B)(i) focuses on step-two discretionary determinations, not threshold judgments about eligibility. Here, too, subparagraph (B)(i) reflects our law's longstanding distinction between eligibility determinations under specific statutory standards and subsequent decisions about whether to grant ultimate relief through an exercise of discretion. Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 353-354, 76 S.Ct. 919, 100 L.Ed. 1242 (1956).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,124,"Still other clues confirm that subparagraph (B)(i) targets second-step discretionary decisions. Take the title Congress  chose in § 1252(a)(2)(B). It labeled this provision Denials of discretionary relief. In doing so, Congress left little doubt that subparagraph (B) and its accompanying clauses (i) and (ii) are designed to bar review of only those decisions invested to the Attorney General's discretion, not antecedent statutory eligibility determinations.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,125,"Consider as well the statute's history. When Congress borrows words from an established legal context, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to them. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). And that's exactly what happened here. Before Congress enacted subparagraph (B)(i), courts reviewed both first-step eligibility determinations and second-step discretionary determinations. Foti v. INS, 375 U.S. 217, 228-230, and n. 15, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963) (holding second-step judgments reviewable for arbitrariness and abuse of discretion). By adding subparagraph (B)(i) in 1996, Congress clearly altered that regime. Yet Congress did so carefully. In precluding review of judgments regarding the granting of relief, Congress used language very similar to the language this Court had long used to describe second-step discretionary determinations. See, e.g., INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (distinguishing the discretionary grant of relief from prima facie eligibility), id., at 333, 112 S.Ct. 719 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (distinguishing the Attorney General's power to grant  relief from judgments of statutory ineligibility), INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (distinguishing the ultimate grant of relief from prima facie eligibility in adjustment-of-status cases specifically), INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 26, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (per curiam) (statute authorized the Attorney General in his discretion to grant relief, but only if certain eligibility requirements are met). All of which provides still one more strong indication that Congress used the phrase regarding the granting of relief to target step-two discretionary decisions alone.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,127,"Not only does the majority ignore most of these contextual clues. Its own arguments from statutory context do more to hurt than help its cause. The majority first directs us to § 1252(a)(2)(D). That provision says that nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter  which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals. According to the majority, this language would make no sense and do no work unless we read subparagraph (B)(i) to bar judicial review of any decision under § 1255. As the majority puts it, subparagraph (D)'s directive preserving judicial review for constitutional claims and questions of law necessarily implies that something must remain unamenable to judicial review under subparagraph (B)(i). Ante, at 1622-1623. And the only remaining category that could be immune from judicial review is subparagraph (B)(i) cases involving questions of fact like Mr. Patel's. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,128,"This argument falters almost immediately. Everyone agrees that, at the very least, subparagraph (B)(i) precludes judicial review of the Attorney General's second-step discretionary judgments regarding the granting of relief. And everyone agrees that subparagraph (D) restores judicial review of these discretionary judgments only to the extent a legal question or constitutional claim is in play. So, for example, if  the Attorney General sought to exercise his discretion to discriminate against an applicant on the basis of race, subparagraph (D) would allow judicial review despite the terms of subparagraph (B)(i). But if no legal or constitutional defect is alleged, judicial review would be impermissible. It is hardly necessary to adopt the majority's interpretation to fit these two provisions together and give each real work to do.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,129,"Even more fundamentally, the majority's argument proceeds on a mistaken assumption. On its view, subparagraph (D) must leave something unreviewable under subparagraph (B)(i) for the former to make any sense as an exception. But that takes far too blinkered a view of the statutory scheme, it is not as if these are the only two provisions in our Nation's immigration laws. By its terms, subparagraph (D) operates across a whole chapter of the U. S. Code. And in fact, subparagraph (D) undoubtedly performs real work as an exception with respect to other provisions besides subparagraph (B)(i). To take just one example, this Court has already decided a case discussing subparagraph (D)'s implications for cases arising under subparagraph (C). See, e.g., Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1062, 1072-73, 206 L.Ed.2d 271 (2020) (explaining subparagraph (D)'s impact on § 1252(a)(2)(C)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,130,"The majority's argument fails for still another reason. It overlooks the basic principle of statutory construction that a statute dealing with a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum. Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 153, 96 S.Ct. 1989, 48 L.Ed.2d 540 (1976). Congress enacted subparagraph (B)(i) in 1996 to address the narrow question of judicial review over administrative denials of discretionary relief. Meanwhile, as the majority acknowledges, Congress adopted subparagraph (D) nearly a decade later and did so to address a much larger problem —the potential that many statutes in the INA foreclosing judicial review might be unconstitutional in certain applications. Ante, at 1622-1623. Congress responded to this potential problem by allowing legal and constitutional challenges under any other provision of an entire chapter of the U. S. Code. § 1252(a)(2)(D). In doing so, subparagraph (D)'s later-in-time and more general reference to constitutional claims or questions of law across a full chapter of the U. S. Code did nothing to disturb subparagraph (B)(i)'s targeted application to judgments regarding the granting of relief under § 1255. Instead, the statutes work in tandem. The majority's approach ignores this conclusion, and along with it subparagraph (B)(i)'s specific language.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,131,"Perhaps sensing the weakness of its main contextual argument, the majority tries another. It insists that Mr. Patel cannot explain why subparagraph (B)(i) should be read to allow courts to review  the BIA's factual findings when subparagraph (C) prohibits courts from doing so. Ante, at 1625-1626. But there is no incongruity here. The two subparagraphs use different language and perform different work. Subparagraph (B)(i) only disallows judicial review of judgments regarding the granting of relief and covers the mine run of cases. Subparagraph (C) speaks more broadly, precluding review of any final order of removal, and addresses specifically those aliens who are removable because of past criminal offenses. And it is hardly surprising that Congress might wish to use different language allowing greater judicial review in cases involving noncriminal aliens than in cases involving aliens who have been convicted of criminal offenses in this country.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,132,"Tellingly too, the majority's contextual arguments yield an inexplicable anomaly. On its view, subparagraph (B)(i) precludes judicial review of all adjustment-of-status applications, whether an individual seeks to challenge the agency's step-one eligibility determination or its step-two discretionary judgment. Subparagraph (D) then sweeps in to restore judicial review for legal and constitutional questions. But by its terms, subparagraph (D) applies only to petitions for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,133,"This feature of the law has profound consequences under the majority's reading of the INA. Yes, on its account, those like Mr. Patel who are subject to removal orders can still challenge at least the agency's legal and constitutional errors by petitioning for review in a federal court of appeals. But individuals frequently seek to adjust their status and secure a green card outside the removal context. And when the government rejects an application for adjustment of status in these cases, individuals routinely seek judicial review in district court. See Brief for Respondent 39, see also Sanchez v. Mayorkas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1809, 1812, 210 L.Ed.2d 52 (2021) (reviewing one such challenge). There, subparagraph (D) does not apply to preserve review of legal and constitutional questions. So under the majority's construction of subparagraph (B)(i), individuals who could once secure judicial review to correct administrative errors at step one in district court are now, after its decision, likely left with no avenue for judicial relief of any kind. An agency may err about the facts, the law, or even the Constitution and nothing can be done about it.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,134,"Nor is this some small sideshow. As the government, Mr. Patel, and amici stress, thousands of individuals seek to obtain a green card every year outside the removal context—the student hoping to remain in the country, the foreigner who marries a U. S. citizen, the skilled worker sponsored by her employer. In the last three months of 2021 alone, USCIS denied more than 13,000 green-card applications, with nearly 790,000 still pending.4 The agency issues decisions on those applications in unpublished and terse letters, which appear to receive little or no administrative review within DHS. See Brief for National Immigration Litigation Alliance et al. as Amici Curiae 25. With so many applications receiving such abbreviated treatment, who can be surprised that DHS sometimes makes serious errors, or may even be tempted to take shortcuts inconsistent with the law? See id., at 23-27 (documenting DHS errors). Until today, courts could  correct mistakes like these. But the majority's construction of subparagraph (B)(i) will almost surely end all that and foreclose judicial review for countless law-abiding individuals whose lives may be upended by bureaucratic misfeasance.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,135,"The majority's response is hardly satisfying. The majority does not try to explain how its interpretation fits with the usual presumption of judicial reviewability of administrative actions—a presumption it claims to endorse and no party before us questions. Ante, at 1627. Instead, the majority muses that denying green-card applicants any ability to seek judicial review might be consistent with Congress' choice to reduce procedural protections in the context of discretionary relief. Ante, at 1626-1627. But a hunch about unexpressed legislative intentions is no response to our usual presumption of judicial review. Nor is it any answer to the mountain of textual and contextual evidence suggesting that Congress limited judicial review only with respect to second-step discretionary decisions, not decisions about statutory eligibility.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,136,"Just look, too, at all the guesswork lurking behind the majority's hunch. The majority's argument first depends on a hypothesis that Congress intentionally designed a scheme that encourages individuals who receive erroneous rulings on their green-card applications to overstay their visas and remain in this country unlawfully. Next, it depends on a second-level hypothesis that Congress replaced a presumptive promise of judicial review with a scheme in which judicial review depends on the happenstance of a governmental decision to seek removal. Finally, the majority's position relies on a third supposition—that Congress might have withdrawn judicial review for thousands upon thousands of lawfully present persons annually, and done so without expressly discussing the question. Often this Court rejects as implausible statutory interpretations that seek to squeeze elephants into mouseholes. See, e.g., Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). Today's interpretation seeks to cram a veritable legislative zoo into one clause of one subparagraph of one subsection of our Nation's vast immigration laws.*",Gorsuch,0,
2021-023,137,"The majority concludes that courts are powerless to correct an agency decision holding an individual ineligible for relief from removal based on a factual error, no matter how egregious the error might be. The majority's interpretation has the further consequence of denying any chance to correct agency errors in processing green-card applications outside the removal context. Even the government cannot bring itself to endorse the majority's arresting conclusions. For good reason. Those conclusions are at war with all the evidence before us. They read language out of the statute and collapse the law's clear two-step framework. They disregard the lessons of neighboring provisions and even ignore the statute's very title. They make no sense of the statute's history. Altogether, the majority's novel expansion of a narrow statutory exception winds up swallowing the law's general rule guaranteeing individuals the chance to seek judicial review to correct obvious bureaucratic missteps. It is a conclusion that turns an agency once accountable to the rule of law into an authority unto itself. Perhaps some would welcome a world like that. But it is hardly the world Congress ordained.",Gorsuch,0,

Under the program, parents designate the secondary school they would like their child to attend— public or private—and the school district transmits payments to that school to help defray the costs of tuition. Most private schools are eligible to receive the payments, so long as they are nonsectarian.

The Montana Supreme  Court held that the program, to the extent it included religious schools, violated a provision of the Montana Constitution that barred government aid to any school controlled in whole or in part by a church, sect, or denomination. As a result of that holding, the State terminated the scholarship program, preventing the petitioners from accessing scholarship funds they otherwise would have used to fund their children's educations at religious schools.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,53,"We again held that the Free Exercise Clause forbade the State's action.

Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2255. A State need not subsidize private education, we concluded, but once a State decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.

2021-024,55,"The unremarkable principles applied in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza suffice to resolve this case. Maine offers its citizens a benefit: tuition assistance payments for any family whose school district does not provide a public secondary school. Just like the wide range of nonprofit organizations eligible to receive playground resurfacing grants in Trinity Lutheran, a wide range of private schools are eligible to receive Maine tuition assistance payments here. And like the daycare center in Trinity Lutheran, BCS and Temple Academy are disqualified from this generally available benefit solely because of their religious character. 582 U.

2021-024,56,"Our recent decision in Espinoza applied these basic principles in the context of religious education that we consider today. There, as here, we considered a state benefit program under which public funds flowed to support tuition payments at private schools. And there, as here, that program specifically carved out private religious schools from those eligible to receive such funds. While the wording of the Montana and Maine provisions is different, their effect is the same: to disqualify some private schools from funding solely because they are religious. 591 U.

2021-024,58,"This is not one of them. As noted, a neutral benefit program in which public funds flow to religious organizations through the independent choices of private benefit recipients does not offend the Establishment Clause. See Zelman, 536 U.S. at 652-653, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Maine's decision to continue excluding religious schools from its tuition assistance program after Zelman thus promotes stricter separation of church and state than the Federal Constitution requires. See also post, at 2004  (BREYER, J., dissenting) (States may choose not to fund certain religious activity even when the Establishment Clause does not itself prohibit the State from funding that activity), post, at 2012 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (same point).",Roberts,0,
2021-024,59,"But as we explained in both Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, such an interest in separating church and state `more fiercely' than the Federal Constitution `cannot qualify as compelling' in the face of the infringement of free exercise.

Justice BREYER stresses the importance of government neutrality when it comes to religious matters, post, at 2009, but there is nothing neutral about Maine's program. The State pays tuition for certain students at private schools—so long as the schools are not religious. That is discrimination against religion.

2021-024,61,"The First Circuit attempted to distinguish our precedent by recharacterizing the nature of Maine's tuition assistance program in two ways, both of which Maine echoes before this Court. First, the panel defined the benefit at issue as the rough equivalent of a Maine public school education, an education that cannot include sectarian instruction. 979 F.3d at 44, see also Brief for Respondent 22. Second, the panel defined the nature of the exclusion as one based not on a school's religious status, as in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, but on religious uses of public funds. 979 F.3d at 38-40, see also Brief for Respondent 35. Neither of these formal distinctions suffices to distinguish this case from Trinity Lutheran or Espinoza, or to affect the application of the free exercise principles outlined above.",Roberts,0,

As Maine puts it, the public benefit Maine is offering is a free public education. Brief for Respondent 1-2.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,64,"To start with, the statute does not say anything like that. It says that an SAU without a secondary school of its own shall pay the tuition  at the public school or the approved private school of the parent's choice at which the student is accepted. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20-A, § 5204(4). The benefit is tuition at a public or private school, selected by the parent, with no suggestion that the private  school must somehow provide a public education.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,65,"This reading of the statute is confirmed by the program's operation. The differences between private schools eligible to receive tuition assistance under Maine's program and a Maine public school are numerous and important. To start with the most obvious, private schools are different by definition because they do not have to accept all students. Public schools generally do. Second, the free public education that Maine insists it is providing through the tuition assistance program is often not free. That assistance is available at private schools that charge several times the maximum benefit that Maine is willing to provide. See Stipulated Record, Exh. 2, in No. 1:18-cv-327 (Me., Mar. 12, 2019), ECF Doc. 24-2, p. 11, Brief for Respondent 32.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,66,"Moreover, the curriculum taught at participating private schools need not even resemble that taught in the Maine public schools. For example, Maine public schools must abide by certain parameters for essential instruction in English language arts, mathematics, science and technology, social studies, career and education development, visual and performing arts, health, physical education and wellness, and world languages. § 6209. But NEASC-accredited private schools are exempt from these requirements, and instead subject only to general standards and indicators governing the implementation of their own chosen curriculum. Brief for Respondent 32, see NEASC, Standards— 20/20 Process (rev. Aug. 2021), https://cis.neasc.org/standards2020 (requiring, for instance, that curriculum planning supports the school's core beliefs and the needs of the students, and that the written curriculum aligns horizontally and vertically).",Roberts,0,
2021-024,67,"Private schools approved by the Department (rather than accredited by NEASC) are likewise exempt from many of the State's curricular requirements, so long as fewer than 60% of their students receive tuition assistance from the State. For instance, such schools need not abide by Maine's comprehensive, statewide system of learning results, including the parameters for essential instruction referenced above, and they need not administer the annual state assessments in English language arts, mathematics, and science. §§ 2951(6), 6209, see also ECF Doc. 24-2, at 9.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,68,"There are other distinctions, too. Participating schools need not hire state-certified teachers. Compare Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20-A, § 13003(1), with § 13003(3). And the schools can be single-sex. See ECF Doc. 24-2, at 11. In short, it is simply not the case that these schools, to be eligible for state funds, must offer an education that is equivalent—roughly or otherwise— to that available in the Maine public schools.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,69,"But the key manner in which the two educational experiences are required to be equivalent is that they must both be secular. Saying that Maine offers a benefit limited to private secular education is just another way of saying that Maine does not extend tuition assistance payments to parents who choose to educate their children at religious schools. But the definition of a particular program can always be manipulated to subsume the challenged condition, and to allow States to recast a condition on funding in this manner would be to see the First Amendment reduced to a simple semantic exercise.

Maine's formulation does not answer the question in this case, it simply restates it.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,70,"Indeed, were we to accept Maine's argument, our decision in Espinoza would be rendered essentially meaningless. By Maine's logic, Montana could have obtained the same result that we held violated the First Amendment simply by redefining its tax credit for sponsors of generally available scholarships as limited to tuition payments for the rough equivalent of a Montana public education—meaning a secular education. But our holding in Espinoza turned on the substance of free exercise protections, not on the presence or absence of magic words. That holding applies fully whether the prohibited discrimination is in an express provision like § 2951(2) or in a party's reconceptualization of the public benefit.",Roberts,0,

The State retains a number of options: it could expand the reach of its public school system, increase the availability of transportation, provide some combination of tutoring, remote learning, and partial attendance, or even operate boarding schools of its own. As we held in Espinoza, a State need not subsidize private education. But once a State decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious. 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2261.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,74,"The Court of Appeals also attempted to distinguish this case from Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza on the ground that the funding restrictions in those cases were solely status-based religious discrimination, while the challenged provision here imposes a use-based restriction. 979 F.3d at 35, 37-38. Justice BREYER makes the same argument. Post, at 2006-2007, 2009-2010 (dissenting opinion).",Roberts,0,

We noted that the case involved express discrimination based on religious identity, which was sufficient unto the day in deciding it, and that our opinion did not address religious uses of funding. Id., at ___, n. 3, 137 S.Ct., at 2024, n. 3 (plurality opinion).",Roberts,0,
2021-024,76,"So too in Espinoza, the discrimination at issue was described by the Montana Supreme Court as a prohibition on aiding schools controlled by churches, and we  analyzed the issue in terms of religious status and not religious use. 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2256. Foreshadowing Maine's argument here, Montana argued that its case was different from Trinity Lutheran's because it involved not playground resurfacing, but general funds that could be used for religious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that believe faith should `permeate' everything they do. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2256. We explained, however, that the strict scrutiny triggered by status-based discrimination could not be avoided by arguing that one of its goals or effects was preventing religious organizations from putting aid to religious uses. Ibid. (emphasis added). And we noted that nothing in our analysis was meant to suggest that we agreed with Montana that some lesser degree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses of government aid. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2257.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,77,"Maine's argument, however—along with the decision below and Justice BREYER's dissent—is premised on precisely such a distinction. See Brief for Respondent 44 (Maine has not broadly excluded private schools simply because they are affiliated with or controlled by a religious organization. Rather, a school is excluded only if it promotes a particular faith and presents academic material through the lens of that faith.), 979 F.3d at 40 (Maine provision does not bar schools from receiving funding simply based on their religious identity but instead based on the religious use that they would make of it in instructing children.), post, at 2007 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (Unlike the circumstances present in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, it is religious activity, not religious labels, that lies at the heart of this case.).",Roberts,0,
2021-024,78,"That premise, however, misreads our precedents. In Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, we held that the Free Exercise Clause forbids discrimination on the basis of religious status. But those decisions never suggested that use-based discrimination is any less offensive to the Free Exercise Clause. This case illustrates why. Educating young people in their faith, inculcating its teachings, and training them to live their faith are responsibilities that lie at the very core of the mission of a private religious school. Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2049, 2064, 207 L.Ed.2d 870 (2020), see also Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v.

2021-024,79,"Any attempt to give effect to such a distinction by scrutinizing whether and how a religious school pursues its educational mission would also raise serious concerns about state entanglement with religion and denominational favoritism.

Indeed, Maine concedes that the Department barely engages in any such scrutiny when enforcing the nonsectarian requirement. See Brief for Respondent 5 (asserting that there will be no need to probe private schools' uses of tuition assistance funds because schools self-identify as nonsectarian under the program and the need for any further questioning is extremely rare). That suggests that any status-use distinction lacks a meaningful application not only in theory, but in practice as well. In short, the prohibition on status-based discrimination under the Free Exercise Clause is not a permission to engage in use-based discrimination.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,80,"Maine and the dissents invoke Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004), in support of the argument that the State may preclude parents from designating a religious school to receive  tuition assistance payments. In that case, Washington had established a scholarship fund to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses. But the program excluded one particular use of the scholarship funds: the essentially religious endeavor of pursuing a degree designed to train a minister to lead a congregation. Id., at 721, 124 S.Ct. 1307, Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2257. We upheld that restriction against a free exercise challenge, reasoning that the State had merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction. Locke, 540 U.S. at 721, 124 S.Ct. 1307.",Roberts,0,
2021-024,81,"Our opinions in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, however, have already explained why Locke can be of no help to Maine here.

2021-024,86,"The First Amendment begins by forbidding the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion. It next forbids them to make any law prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Court today pays almost no attention to the words in the first Clause while giving almost exclusive attention to the words in the second. The majority also fails to recognize the `play in the joints' between the two Clauses. See Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 2012, 2019, 198 L.Ed.2d 551 (2017). That play gives States some degree of legislative leeway. It sometimes allows a State to further antiestablishment interests by withholding aid from religious institutions without violating the Constitution's protections for the free exercise of religion. In my view,  Maine's nonsectarian requirement falls squarely within the scope of that constitutional leeway. I respectfully dissent.",Breyer,0,

The first Clause, the Establishment Clause, seems to bar all government sponsorship, financial support, or active involvement  in religious activity, while the second Clause, the Free Exercise Clause, seems to bar all governmental restraint on religious practice. Id., at 668, 670, 90 S.Ct. 1409. The apparently absolutist nature of these two prohibitions means that either Clause, if expanded to a logical extreme, would tend to clash with the other. Id., at 668-669, 90 S.Ct. 1409. Because of this, we have said, the two Clauses are frequently in tension, Locke v.

This means that a State cannot use its public school system to aid any or all religious faiths or sects in the dissemination of their doctrines and ideals. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v.

2021-024,92,"Although the Religion Clauses are, in practice, often in tension, they nonetheless express complementary values. Cutter, 544 U.S. at 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113. Together they attempt to chart a course of constitutional neutrality with respect to government and religion. Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409. They were written to help create an American Nation free of the religious conflict that had long plagued European nations with governmentally established religions. Engel, 370 U.S. at 431, 82 S.Ct. 1261. Through the Clauses, the Framers sought to avoid the anguish, hardship and bitter strife that resulted from the union of Church and State in those countries.

2021-024,93,"The Religion Clauses thus created a compromise in the form of religious freedom. They aspired to create a benevolent neutrality—one which would permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference. Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409. The basic purpose of these provisions was to insure that no religion be sponsored or favored, none commanded, and none inhibited. Ibid. This religious freedom in effect meant that people were entitled to worship God in their own way and to teach their children in that way. C. Radcliffe, The Law & Its Compass 71 (1960). We have historically interpreted the Religion Clauses with these basic principles in mind. See, e.g., Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 771-772, 794-796, 93 S.Ct. 2955, Walz, 397 U.S. at 668-670, 90 S.Ct. 1409, Engel, 370 U.S. at 429-432, 82 S.Ct. 1261.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,94,"And in applying these Clauses, we have often said that there is room for play in the joints between them. Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409, see, e.g., Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 469, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973), Cutter, 544 U.S. at 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113, Locke, 540 U.S. at 718-719, 124 S.Ct. 1307, Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2019-2020, Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2253-2254. This doctrine reflects the fact that it may be difficult to determine in any particular case whether the Free Exercise Clause requires a State to fund the activities of a religious institution, or whether the Establishment Clause prohibits the State from doing so. Rather than attempting to draw a highly reticulated and complex free-exercise/establishment line that varies based on the specific circumstances of each state-funded program, we have provided general interpretive principles that apply uniformly in all Religion Clause cases. At the same time, we have made clear that States enjoy a degree of freedom to navigate the Clauses' competing prohibitions. See, e.g., Cutter, 544 U.S. at 713, 719-720, 125 S.Ct. 2113. This includes choosing not to fund certain religious activity where States have strong, establishment-related reasons for not doing so. See, e.g., Locke, 540 U.S. at 719-722, 124 S.Ct. 1307. And, States have freedom to make this choice even when the Establishment Clause does not itself prohibit the State from funding that activity. Id., at 719, 124 S.Ct. 1307 (There are some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause). The Court today nowhere mentions, and I fear effectively abandons, this longstanding doctrine.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,96,"I have previously discussed my views of the relationship between the Religion Clauses and how I believe these Clauses should be interpreted to advance their goal of avoiding religious strife. See, e.g., Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2288-2292 (dissenting opinion), Van Orden  v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 698-705, 125 S.Ct. 2854, 162 L.Ed.2d 607 (2005) (opinion concurring in judgment), Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 717-729, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002) (dissenting opinion). Here I simply note the increased risk of religiously based social conflict when government promotes religion in its public school system. The prescription of prayer and Bible reading in the public schools, during and as part of the curricular day, involving young impressionable children whose school attendance is statutorily compelled, can give rise to those very divisive influences and inhibitions of freedom which both religion clauses of the First Amendment sought to prevent. Schempp, 374 U.S. at 307, 83 S.Ct. 1560 (Goldberg, J., concurring).",Breyer,0,
2021-024,97,"This potential for religious strife is still with us. We are today a Nation with well over 100 different religious groups, from Free Will Baptist to African Methodist, Buddhist to Humanist. See Pew Research Center, America's Changing Religious Landscape 21 (May 12, 2015). People in our country adhere to a vast array of beliefs, ideals, and philosophies. And with greater religious diversity comes greater risk of religiously based strife, conflict, and social division. The Religion Clauses were written in part to help avoid that disunion. As Thomas Jefferson, one of the leading drafters and proponents of those Clauses, wrote, `to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.' Everson, 330 U.S. at 13, 67 S.Ct. 504. And as James Madison, another drafter and proponent, said, compelled taxpayer sponsorship of religion is itself a signal of persecution, which will destroy that moderation and harmony which the forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with Religion, has produced amongst its several sects. Id., at 68-69, 67 S.Ct. 504 (appendix to dissenting opinion of Rutledge, J.). To interpret the Clauses with these concerns in mind may help to further their original purpose of avoiding religious-based division.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,98,"I have also previously explained why I believe that a rigid, bright-line approach to the Religion Clauses—an approach without any leeway or play in the joints—will too often work against the Clauses' underlying purposes. Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2291 (dissenting opinion), see also Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 669-700, 125 S.Ct. 2854 (opinion concurring in judgment). Government benefits come in many shapes and sizes. Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2290 (dissenting opinion). Not all state-funded programs that have religious restrictions carry the same risk of creating social division and conflict. In my view, that risk can best be understood by considering the particular benefit at issue, along with the reasons for the particular religious restriction at issue. See ibid., Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2026-2027 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). Recognition that States enjoy a degree of constitutional leeway allows States to enact laws sensitive to local circumstances while also allowing this Court to consider those circumstances in light of the basic values underlying the Religion Clauses.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,99,"In a word, to interpret the two Clauses as if they were joined at the hip will work against their basic purpose: to allow for an American society with practitioners of over 100 different religions, and those who do not practice religion at all, to live together without serious risk of religion-based social divisions.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,101,The majority believes that the principles set forth in this Court's earlier cases easily resolve this case. But they do not.,Breyer,0,
2021-024,102,"We have previously found, as the majority points out, that a neutral benefit program in which public funds flow to religious organizations through the independent choices of private benefit recipients does not offend the Establishment Clause. Ante, at 1997 (citing Zelman, 536 U.S. at 652-653, 122 S.Ct. 2460). We have thus concluded that a State may, consistent with the Establishment Clause, provide funding to religious schools through a general public funding program if the government aid  reaches religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of  individual aid recipients. Id., at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,103,"But the key word is may. We have never previously held what the Court holds today, namely, that a State must (not may) use state funds to pay for religious education as part of a tuition program designed to ensure the provision of free statewide public school education.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,104,"What happens once may becomes must? Does that transformation mean that a school district that pays for public schools must pay equivalent funds to parents who wish to send their children to religious schools? Does it mean that school districts that give vouchers for use at charter schools must pay equivalent funds to parents who wish to give their children a religious education? What other social benefits are there the State's provision of which means—under the majority's interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause— that the State must pay parents for the religious equivalent of the secular benefit provided? The concept of play in the joints means that courts need not, and should not, answer with must these questions that can more appropriately be answered with may.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,105,"The majority also asserts that the `unremarkable' principles applied in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza suffice to resolve this case. Ante, at 1997. Not so. The state-funded program at issue in Trinity Lutheran provided payment for resurfacing school playgrounds to make them safer for children. Any Establishment Clause concerns arising from providing money to religious schools for the creation of safer play yards are readily distinguishable from those raised by providing money to religious schools through the program at issue here—a tuition program designed to ensure that all children receive their constitutionally guaranteed right to a free public education. After all, cities and States normally pay for police forces, fire protection, paved streets, municipal transport, and hosts of other services that benefit churches as well as secular organizations. But paying the salary of a religious teacher as part of a public school tuition program is a different matter.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,106,"In addition, schools were excluded from the playground resurfacing program at issue in Trinity Lutheran because of the mere fact that they were owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity. 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2017. Schools were thus disqualified from receiving playground funds solely because of their religious character, not because of the religious uses of the funding they would receive. Id., at ___,___, n. 3, 137 S.Ct., at 2021, 2024, n. 3. Here, by contrast, a school's `affiliation or association with a church or religious institution  is not dispositive' of its ability to receive tuition funds. 979 F.3d 21, 38 (CA1 2020) (quoting then-commissioner of Maine's Department of Education). Instead, Maine chooses not to fund only those schools that `promote the faith or belief system with which the schools are associated and/or present the academic material taught through the lens of this faith'—i.e., schools that will use public money for religious purposes. Ibid. Maine thus excludes  schools from its tuition program not because of the schools' religious character but because the schools will use the funds to teach and promote religious ideals.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,107,"For similar reasons, Espinoza does not resolve the present case. In Espinoza, Montana created a scholarship program for students attending private schools. 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2251. But the State prohibited families from using the scholarship at any private school `owned or controlled in whole or in part by any church, religious sect, or denomination.' Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2252 (quoting Mont. Admin. Rule § 42.4.802(1)(a) (2015)). As in Trinity Lutheran, Montana denied funds to schools based expressly on religious status and not religious use, to be eligible for scholarship funds, a school had to divorce itself from any religious control or affiliation. 591 U. S. at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2256. Here, again, Maine denies tuition money to schools not because of their religious affiliation, but because they will use state funds to promote religious views.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,108,"These distinctions are important. The very point of the Establishment Clause is to prevent the government from sponsoring religious activity itself, thereby favoring one religion over another or favoring religion over nonreligion. See Engel, 370 U.S. at 430, 82 S.Ct. 1261 (Under the Establishment Clause  government in this country, be it state or federal, is without power to prescribe by law  any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity), Walz, 397 U.S. at 668, 90 S.Ct. 1409 (For the men who wrote the Religion Clauses  the `establishment' of a religion connoted  any active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity), Everson, 330 U.S. at 15, 67 S.Ct. 504 (States may not pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another). State funding of religious activity risks the very social conflict based upon religion that the Religion Clauses were designed to prevent. And, unlike the circumstances present in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza, it is religious activity, not religious labels, that lies at the heart of this case.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,111,"I turn now to consider the Maine program at issue here. Maine's Constitution guarantees Maine's children a free public education by requiring that all towns provide for the support and maintenance of public schools. Art. VIII, pt. 1, § 1, see also Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20-A, § 2(1) (2008). Because of the State's rural geography and dispersed population, however, over half of Maine's school districts do not operate public secondary schools. App. 70. To fulfill its constitutional promise, Maine created a program that provides some parents in these districts with a monetary grant to help them educate their children at the public school or the approved private school of the parent's choice. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20-A, § 5204(4) (Cum. Supp. 2021). The program's function is limited to authorizing the provision of tuition subsidies to the parents of children who live within school districts that simply do not have the resources to operate a public school system, and whose children would otherwise not be given an opportunity to receive a free public education. Hallissey v. School Administrative Dist. No. 77, 2000 ME 143, ¶16, 755 A.2d 1068, 1073.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,112,"Under Maine law, an approved private school must be nonsectarian. § 2951(2). A school fails to meet that requirement (and is deemed sectarian) only if it is both (1) `associated with a particular faith or belief system' and also (2) `promotes the faith or belief system with which it is  associated and/or presents the academic material taught through the lens of this faith.' 979 F.3d at 38 (quoting Maine's then-education commissioner). To determine whether a school is sectarian, the `focus is on what the school teaches through its curriculum and related activities, and how the material is presented.' Ibid. (emphasis deleted). `Affiliation or association with a church or religious institution is not dispositive' of sectarian status. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,113,"The two private religious schools at issue here satisfy both of these criteria. They are affiliated with a church or religious organization. See App. 80, 91. And they also teach students to accept particular religious beliefs and to engage in particular religious practices.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,114,"The first school, Bangor Christian, has educational objectives that include `leading each unsaved student to trust Christ as his/her personal savior and then to follow Christ as Lord of his/her life,' and `developing within each student a Christian world view and Christian philosophy of life.' Id., at 84. Bangor Christian does not believe there is any way to separate the religious instruction from the academic instruction. Id., at 85. Academic instruction and religious instruction are thus completely intertwined. Ibid. Bangor Christian teaches in its social studies class, for example, `that God has ordained evangelism.' Id., at 87. And in science class, students learn that atmospheric layers `are evidence of God's good design.' Id., at 89.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,115,"The second school, Temple Academy, similarly promotes religion through academics. Its educational philosophy `is based on a thoroughly Christian and Biblical world view.' Id., at 92. The school's objectives include `fostering within each student an attitude of love and reverence of the Bible as the infallible, inerrant, and authoritative Word of God.' Ibid. And the school's `academic growth' objectives include `providing a sound academic education in which the subject areas are taught from a Christian point of view,' and `helping every student develop a truly Christian world view by integrating studies with the truths of Scripture.' Id., at 93. Like Bangor Christian, Temple provides a `biblically-integrated education,' which means that the Bible is used in every subject that is taught. Id., at 96. In mathematics classes, for example, students learn that a creator designed the universe such that `one plus one is always going to be two.' Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,116,"The differences between this kind of education and a purely civic, public education are important. The religious education and formation of students is the very reason for the existence of most private religious schools. Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2049, 2055, 207 L.Ed.2d 870 (2020). Educating young people in their faith, inculcating its teachings, and training them to live their faith, we have said, are responsibilities that lie at the very core of the mission of a private religious school. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2064. Indeed, we have recognized that the connection that religious institutions draw between their central purpose and educating the young in the faith is so close that teachers employed at such schools act as ministers for purposes of the First Amendment. Id., at ___, ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2055-2056, 2066, see also Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171, 132 S.Ct. 694, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012).",Breyer,0,
2021-024,117,"By contrast, public schools, including those in Maine, seek first and foremost to provide a primarily civic education. We have said that, in doing so, they comprise a most vital civic institution for the preservation  of a democratic system of government, and  the primary vehicle for transmitting the values on which our society rests. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To play that role effectively, public schools are religiously neutral, neither disparaging nor promoting any one particular system of religious beliefs. We accordingly have, as explained above, consistently required public school education to be free from religious affiliation or indoctrination. Cf. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583-584, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987) (The Court has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary public schools).",Breyer,0,
2021-024,118,"Maine legislators who endorsed the State's nonsectarian requirement recognized these differences between public and religious education. They did not want Maine taxpayers to finance, through a tuition program designed to ensure the provision of free public education, schools that would use state money for teaching religious practices. See, e.g., App. 104 (Maine representative stating that from a public policy position, we must believe that a religiously neutral classroom is the best if funded by public dollars), id., at 106 (Maine senator asserting that the State's limited tax dollars for schools should be spent on those that are non-religious and that are neutral on religion). Underlying these views is the belief that the Establishment Clause seeks government neutrality. And the legislators thought that government payment for this kind of religious education would be antithetical to the religiously neutral education that the Establishment Clause requires in public schools. Cf. Epperson, 393 U.S. at 106, 89 S.Ct. 266, McCollum, 333 U.S. at 211, 68 S.Ct. 461. Maine's nonsectarian requirement, they believed, furthered the State's antiestablishment interests in not promoting religion in its public school system, the requirement prevented public funds—funds allocated to ensure that all children receive their constitutional right to a free public education—from being given to schools that would use the funds to promote religion.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,119,"In the majority's view, the fact that private individuals, not Maine itself, choose to spend the State's money on religious education saves Maine's program from Establishment Clause condemnation. But that fact, as I have said, simply permits Maine to route funds to religious schools. See, e.g., Zelman, 536 U.S., at 652, 122 S.Ct. 2460. It does not require Maine to spend its money in that way. That is because, as explained above, this Court has long followed a legal doctrine that gives States flexibility to navigate the tension between the two Religion Clauses. Supra, at 2004. This doctrine recognizes that there is `play in the joints' between what the Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause compels. Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2019 (quoting Locke, 540 U.S. at 718, 124 S.Ct. 1307). This wiggle-room means that the course of constitutional neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line. Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409. And in walking this line of government neutrality, States must have some space for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise Clause nor prohibited by the Establishment Clause, Cutter, 544 U.S. at 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113, in which they can navigate the tension created by the Clauses and consider their own interests in light of the Clauses' competing prohibitions. See, e.g., Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,120,"Nothing in our Free Exercise Clause cases compels Maine to give tuition aid to private schools that will use the funds to  provide a religious education. As explained above, this Court's decisions in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza prohibit States from denying aid to religious schools solely because of a school's religious status—that is, its affiliation with or control by a religious organization. Supra, at 2006-2007. But we have never said that the Free Exercise Clause prohibits States from withholding funds because of the religious use to which the money will be put. Cf. Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2022-2023. To the contrary, we upheld in Locke a State's decision to deny public funding to a recipient because of what he proposed to do with the money, when what he proposed to do was to use the funds to prepare for the ministry. Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2023, see also Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2257 (characterizing Locke similarly). Maine does not refuse to pay tuition at private schools because of religious status or affiliation. The State only denies funding to schools that will use the money to promote religious beliefs through a religiously integrated education —an education that, in Maine's view, is not a replacement for a civic-focused public education. See 979 F.3d at 38. This makes Maine's decision to withhold public funds more akin to the state decision that we upheld in Locke, and unlike the withholdings that we invalidated in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,121,"The Free Exercise Clause thus does not require Maine to fund, through its tuition program, schools that will use public money to promote religion. And considering the Establishment Clause concerns underlying the program, Maine's decision not to fund such schools falls squarely within the play in the joints between those two Clauses. Maine has promised all children within the State the right to receive a free public education. In fulfilling this promise, Maine endeavors to provide children the religiously neutral education required in public school systems. And that, in significant part, reflects the State's antiestablishment interests in avoiding spending public money to support what is essentially religious activity. The Religion Clauses give Maine the ability, and flexibility, to make this choice.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,123,"In my view, Maine's nonsectarian requirement is also constitutional because it supports, rather than undermines, the Religion Clauses' goal of avoiding religious strife. Forcing Maine to fund schools that provide the sort of religiously integrated education offered by Bangor Christian and Temple Academy creates a similar potential for religious strife as that raised by promoting religion in public schools. It may appear to some that the State favors a particular religion over others, or favors religion over nonreligion. Members of minority religions, with too few adherents to establish schools, may see injustice in the fact that only those belonging to more popular religions can use state money for religious education. Taxpayers may be upset at having to finance the propagation of religious beliefs that they do not share and with which they disagree. And parents in school districts that have a public secondary school may feel indignant that only some families in the State—those families in the more rural districts without public schools—have the opportunity to give their children a Maine-funded religious education.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,124,"Maine legislators who endorsed the State's nonsectarian requirement understood this potential for social conflict. They recognized the important rights that religious schools have to create the sort of religiously inspired curriculum that Bangor Christian and Temple Academy teach. Legislators also recognized that these private  schools make religiously based enrollment and hiring decisions. Bangor Christian and Temple Academy, for example, have admissions policies that allow them to deny enrollment to students based on gender, gender-identity, sexual orientation, and religion, and both schools require their teachers to be Born Again Christians. App. 82-83, 89, 93, 98. Legislators did not want Maine taxpayers to pay for these religiously based practices—practices not universally endorsed by all citizens of the State—for fear that doing so would cause a significant number of Maine citizens discomfort or displeasure. See, e.g., id., at 101 (Maine representative noting that private religious schools discriminate against citizens of the State of Maine, such as by not hiring individuals whose beliefs are not consistent with the school's religious teachings, and asserting that it is fundamentally wrong for us to fund such discrimination), id., at 104 (Maine representative stating that the people of Maine should not use public money to advance their religious pursuits, and that discrimination in religious institutions should not be funded with my dollar), id., at 107 (Maine senator expressing concern that public funds could be used to teach intolerant religious views). The nonsectarian requirement helped avoid this conflict— the precise kind of social conflict that the Religion Clauses themselves sought to avoid.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,125,"Maine's nonsectarian requirement also serves to avoid religious strife between the State and the religious schools. Given that Maine is funding the schools as part of its effort to ensure that all children receive the basic public education to which they are entitled, Maine has an interest in ensuring that the education provided at these schools meets certain curriculum standards. Religious schools, on the other hand, have an interest in teaching a curriculum that advances the tenets of their religion. And the schools are of course entitled to teach subjects in the way that best reflects their religious beliefs. But the State may disagree with the particular manner in which the schools have decided that these subjects should be taught.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,126,"This is a situation ripe for conflict, as it forces Maine into the position of evaluating the adequacy or appropriateness of the schools' religiously inspired curriculum. Maine does not want this role. As one legislator explained, one of the reasons for the nonsectarian requirement was that government officials cannot, and should not, review the religious teachings of religious schools. Ibid. Another legislator cautioned that the State would be unable to reconcile the curriculum of private religious schools who teach religion in the classroom with Maine standards  that do not include any sort of religion in them. Id., at 102.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,127,"Nor do the schools want Maine in this role. Bangor Christian asserted that it would only consider accepting public funds if it did not have to make any changes in how it operates. Id., at 90. Temple Academy similarly stated that it would only accept state money if it had in writing that the school would not have to alter its admissions standards, hiring standards, or curriculum. Id., at 99. The nonsectarian requirement ensures that Maine is not pitted against private religious schools in these battles over curriculum or operations, thereby avoiding the social strife resulting from this state-versus-religion confrontation. By invalidating the nonsectarian requirement, the majority today subjects the State, the schools, and the people of Maine to social conflict of a kind that they, and the Religion Clauses, sought to prevent.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,128,"I emphasize the problems that may arise out of today's decision because they reinforce  my belief that the Religion Clauses do not require Maine to pay for a religious education simply because, in some rural areas, the State will help parents pay for a secular education. After all, the Establishment Clause forbids a State from paying for the practice of religion itself. And state neutrality in respect to the teaching of the practice of religion lies at the heart of this Clause. See, e.g., Locke, 540 U.S. at 721-722, 124 S.Ct. 1307 (noting that there are few areas in which a State's antiestablishment interests come more into play than state funding of ministers who will lead their congregations in religious endeavors). There is no meaningful difference between a State's payment of the salary of a religious minister and the salary of someone who will teach the practice of religion to a person's children. At bottom, there is almost no area as central to religious belief as the shaping, through primary education, of the next generation's minds and spirits. Zelman, 536 U.S. at 725, 122 S.Ct. 2460 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The Establishment Clause was intended to keep the State out of this area.* * *",Breyer,0,
2021-024,129,"Maine wishes to provide children within the State with a secular, public education. This wish embodies, in significant part, the constitutional need to avoid spending public money to support what is essentially the teaching and practice of religion. That need is reinforced by the fact that we are today a Nation of more than 330 million people who ascribe to over 100 different religions. In that context, state neutrality with respect to religion is particularly important. The Religion Clauses give Maine the right to honor that neutrality by choosing not to fund religious schools as part of its public school tuition program. I believe the majority is wrong to hold the contrary. And with respect, I dissent.",Breyer,0,
2021-024,130,"Justice SOTOMAYOR, dissenting.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,131,"This Court continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build. Justice BREYER explains why the Court's analysis falters on its own terms, and I join all but Part I-B of his dissent. I write separately to add three points.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,132,"First, this Court should not have started down this path five years ago. See Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___, 137 S.Ct. 2012, 198 L.Ed.2d 551 (2017). Before Trinity Lutheran, it was well established that both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct views on the subject of religion—in favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishment—that find no counterpart with respect to other constitutional rights. Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 721, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004). Because of this tension, the Court recognized `room for play in the joints' between the Religion Clauses, with some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause. Id., at 718-719, 124 S.Ct. 1307 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)), see ante, at 2004 (BREYER, J., dissenting). Using this flexibility, and consistent with a rich historical tradition, see Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___ - ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2032-2036 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), States and the Federal Government could decline to fund religious institutions. Moreover, the Court for many decades understood the Establishment Clause to prohibit government from funding religious exercise.1  Over time, the Court eroded these principles in certain respects. See, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 662, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002) (allowing government funds to flow to religious schools if private individuals selected the benefiting schools, the government program was entirely neutral with respect to religion, and families enjoyed a genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious). Nevertheless, the space between the Clauses continued to afford governments some room to recognize the unique status of religious entities and to single them out on that basis for exclusion from otherwise generally applicable laws. Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2031 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,133,"Trinity Lutheran veered sharply away from that understanding. After assuming away an Establishment Clause violation, the Court revolutionized Free Exercise doctrine by equating a State's decision not to fund a religious organization with presumptively unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religious status. See id., at ___ - ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2021-2022. A plurality, however, limited the Court's decision to express discrimination based on religious identity (i.e., status), not religious uses of funding. Id., at ___, n. 3, 137 S.Ct., at 2024, n. 3. In other words, a State was barred from withholding funding from a religious entity solely because of its religious character, id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2024 (opinion of the Court), but retained authority to do so on the basis that the funding would be put to religious uses. Two Terms ago, the Court reprised and extended Trinity Lutheran's error to hold that a State could not limit a private-school voucher program to secular schools. Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2246, 2255, 207 L.Ed.2d 679 (2020). The Court, however, again refrained from extending Trinity Lutheran from funding restrictions based on religious status to those based on religious uses. Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2255-2257 (2020).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,134,"As Justice BREYER explains, see ante, at 2006-2007, this status-use distinction readily distinguishes this case from Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza. I warned in Trinity Lutheran, however, that the Court's analysis could be manipulated to call for a similar fate for lines drawn on the basis of religious use. 582 U. S., at ___, n. 14, 137 S.Ct., at 2041, n. 14 (dissenting opinion). That fear has come to fruition: The Court now holds for the first time that any status-use distinction is immaterial in both theory and practice. Ante, at 2001. It reaches that conclusion by embracing arguments from prior separate writings and ignoring decades of precedent affording governments flexibility in navigating the tension between the Religion Clauses. As a result, in just a few years, the Court has upended constitutional doctrine, shifting from a rule that permits States to decline to fund religious organizations to one that requires States in many circumstances to subsidize religious indoctrination with taxpayer dollars.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,135,"Second, the consequences of the Court's rapid transformation of the Religion Clauses  must not be understated. From a doctrinal perspective, the Court's failure to apply the play-in-the-joints principle here, see ante, at 2009-2010 (BREYER, J., dissenting), leaves one to wonder what, if anything, is left of it. The Court's increasingly expansive view of the Free Exercise Clause risks swallowing the space between the Religion Clauses that once permitted religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference. Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,136,"From a practical perspective, today's decision directs the State of Maine (and, by extension, its taxpaying citizens) to subsidize institutions that undisputedly engage in religious instruction. See ante, at 2007-2008 (BREYER, J., dissenting). In addition, while purporting to protect against discrimination of one kind, the Court requires Maine to fund what many of its citizens believe to be discrimination of other kinds. See ante, at 2010-2011 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (summarizing Bangor Christian Schools' and Temple Academy's policies denying enrollment to students based on gender identity, sexual orientation, and religion). The upshot is that Maine must choose between giving subsidies to its residents or refraining from financing religious teaching and practices.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,137,"Finally, the Court's decision is especially perverse because the benefit at issue is the public education to which all of Maine's children are entitled under the State Constitution. As this Court has long recognized, the Establishment Clause requires that public education be secular and neutral as to religion. See ante, at 2003-2004, 2008-2009 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). The Court avoids this framing of Maine's benefit because, it says, Maine has decided not to operate schools of its own, but instead to offer tuition assistance that parents may direct to the public or private schools of their choice. Ante, at 2000. In fact, any such decision, ibid., was forced upon Maine by the realities of remote geography and low population density, ante, at 1993, which render it impracticable for the State to operate its own schools in many communities.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,138,"The Court's analysis does leave some options open to Maine. For example, under state law, school administrative units (SAUs) that cannot feasibly operate their own schools may contract directly with a public school in another SAU, or with an approved private school, to educate their students. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20-A, §§ 2701, 2702 (2008). I do not understand today's decision to mandate that SAUs contract directly with schools that teach religion, which would go beyond Zelman's private-choice doctrine and blatantly violate the Establishment Clause. Nonetheless, it is irrational for this Court to hold that the Free Exercise Clause bars Maine from giving money to parents to fund the only type of education the State may provide consistent with the Establishment Clause: a religiously neutral one. Nothing in the Constitution requires today's result.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2021-024,139,"What a difference five years makes. In 2017, I feared that the Court was leading us  to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment. Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 2041 (dissenting opinion). Today, the Court leads us to a place where separation of church and state becomes a constitutional violation. If a State cannot offer subsidies to its citizens without being required to fund religious exercise, any State that values its historic antiestablishment interests more than this Court does will have to curtail the support it offers to its citizens. With growing concern for where  this Court will lead us next, I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-025,24,"Under the Medicare statute, the Department of Health and Human Services must reimburse hospitals for certain outpatient prescription drugs that the hospitals provide to Medicare patients.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,37,"As a result, until 2018, HHS consistently relied on option 2 and set reimbursement rates for each drug based on the average-sales-price data provided by manufacturers. Every year, HHS set the reimbursement rates at about 106 percent of each covered drug's average sales price, and HHS used the same reimbursement rates for all hospitals. In other words, until 2018, HHS never varied the reimbursement rates by hospital group. See Medicare Program: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs, 82 Fed. Reg. 52490, 52494-52495 (2017).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,38,"During its rulemaking for 2018, HHS proposed a change to reduce the reimbursement rates only for 340B hospitals. Importantly, HHS did not conduct a survey of hospital acquisition costs. As a policy matter, HHS said that its existing reimbursement  rates resulted in what the agency viewed as overpayments to hospitals that serve low-income or rural populations through the federal 340B program. Federal law requires drug manufacturers to sell prescription drugs to those 340B hospitals at prices below those paid by other hospitals. See 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(1) (setting a ceiling price that manufacturers can charge to 340B hospitals). Consistent with the Medicare statute, however, HHS historically had reimbursed 340B hospitals for covered outpatient prescription drugs at the same reimbursement rates that were set for all other hospitals. For 2018, HHS said that the uniform reimbursement rates combined with the discounted prices paid by 340B hospitals for prescription drugs meant that 340B hospitals were able to generate significant profits when they provided the prescription drugs to Medicare patients. 82 Fed. Reg. 52494.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,39,"In response to HHS's proposed change, the 340B hospitals countered that, under the Medicare statute, HHS could not single out 340B hospitals without conducting a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs. With respect to HHS's policy arguments, the 340B hospitals explained that the reimbursement payments for prescription drugs helped those hospitals offset the considerable costs of providing healthcare to the uninsured and underinsured in low-income and rural communities. The 340B hospitals pointed out, moreover, that Congress had long been aware of the situation. Indeed, the hospitals claimed that Members of Congress not only were aware, but actually intended for the 340B program's drug reimbursements to subsidize other services provided by 340B hospitals. The hospitals noted that Congress had never singled out 340B hospitals for lower Medicare reimbursements for outpatient prescription drugs. Nor, until 2018, had HHS ever done so. Furthermore, the 340B hospitals asserted that reducing their reimbursement rates for prescription drugs would force those hospitals to eliminate or dramatically curtail other crucial programs that provide a wide range of medical services in low-income and rural communities—such as treatments for cancer, mental health issues, opioid addiction, and diabetes.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,40,"In the final rule for 2018, HHS decided to establish two separate reimbursement rates: one rate for non-340B hospitals and another rate for 340B hospitals. The reimbursement rate for non-340B hospitals remained at the historical rate of approximately 106 percent of the average sales price for each drug. But HHS established a substantially reduced rate for 340B hospitals —a rate equal to 77.5 percent of the average sales price for each drug. In setting that rate, HHS relied on an estimate from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission that 340B hospitals obtained prescription drugs at an average discount of at least 22.5 percent below the average sales price charged by manufacturers. Id., at 52496, 52499. HHS estimated that the reduction in the reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals would save Medicare (and deprive 340B hospitals of) about $1.6 billion annually, which by law would be re-allocated for other Medicare services. Id., at 52509-52510. For 2019, HHS set reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals in the same way.",Kavanaugh,0,

HHS claimed that its authority to adjust the  average price for each drug also implicitly encompassed the authority to vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,43,"The American Hospital Association, along with two other hospital industry groups and several hospitals, sued in U.S. District Court to challenge HHS's 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.

But both of those provisions refer to the general payment methodology that HHS employs to set rates for other Medicare outpatient services. By contrast, when HHS sets rates for outpatient prescription drugs, it uses a different payment methodology—namely, the methodology specified by paragraph (14) of § 1395l(t). And nothing in the statute precludes judicial review of reimbursement rates set under paragraph (14).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,55,"HHS further argues that allowing judicial review of the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates would be impractical because the agency is required to operate the program on a budget-neutral basis. Due to that budget-neutrality requirement, HHS says that a judicial ruling invalidating the 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates for certain hospitals would require offsets elsewhere in the program. The Hospitals respond that various potential remedies could make 340B hospitals whole for the past shortfalls without running afoul of the budget-neutrality provision. At this stage, we need not address potential remedies. Regardless, HHS's arguments against judicial review cannot override the text of the statute and the traditional presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action.",Kavanaugh,0,

2021-025,58,"We turn next to the merits. The question is this: If HHS has not conducted a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs, may HHS still vary the reimbursement rates for outpatient prescription drugs by hospital group? The answer is no.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,59,"The 2003 Medicare Act authorizes HHS to set reimbursement rates for covered outpatient prescription drugs provided by hospitals. The Act also specifies how HHS must set those reimbursement rates. 42 U.S.C. § 1395l(t)(14)(A). The statute therefore reflects a careful congressional focus not only on the goal of proper reimbursement rates, but also on the appropriate means to that end.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,60,"To reiterate, the statute affords HHS two options for setting reimbursement rates for outpatient drugs. Option 1 applies if HHS collects hospital acquisition cost survey data from hospitals. § 1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I). If the agency has conducted a survey and collected that data, then HHS may use the data to set reimbursement rates equal to the average acquisition cost for the drug. Ibid. Importantly, in that circumstance, HHS may vary reimbursement rates by hospital group. Ibid.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,61,"By contrast, if HHS does not conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs and if acquisition cost data are therefore not available, HHS must instead proceed under option 2 and obtain price data from drug manufacturers. § 1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II). And in that circumstance, HHS must set reimbursement rates based on the average price for the drug as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary for purposes of this statutory provision. Ibid. Critically, that second option does not authorize HHS to vary reimbursement rates by hospital group. Instead, HHS must set uniform reimbursement rates for all hospitals for  each covered drug, and the rates must be equal to the average price for that drug for that year.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,62,"HHS's authority to proceed under option 1 and to vary reimbursement rates by hospital group thus depends on whether HHS has obtained acquisition cost survey data from hospitals. The statute expressly authorizes HHS to vary rates by hospital group if HHS has conducted such a survey. But the statute does not authorize such a variance in rates if HHS has not conducted a survey. Cf. Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1168, 1177, 206 L.Ed.2d 432 (2020), Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc., 582 U.S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 1664, ___, 198 L.Ed.2d 114 (2017), Russello v.

2021-025,63,"The statute thus protects all hospitals by imposing an important procedural prerequisite —namely, a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs for prescription drugs—before HHS may target particular groups of hospitals for lower reimbursement rates. The survey allows the agency to determine whether there is in fact meaningful, statistically significant variation among hospitals' acquisition costs. The data regarding variation in hospitals' acquisition costs in turn help HHS determine whether and how much it should vary the reimbursement rate among hospital groups. See §§ 1395l(t)(14)(D)(iii)-(iv). But absent that survey data, as Congress determined, HHS may not make billion-dollar decisions differentiating among particular hospital groups. 967 F.3d at 837 (Pillard, J., dissenting).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,64,"In this case, all agree that HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs. See, e.g., 82 Fed. Reg. 52501. HHS nonetheless varied the rates by hospital group, fixing a substantially lower reimbursement rate for 340B hospitals than for non-340B hospitals.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,65,"Under the text and structure of the statute, this case is therefore straightforward: Because HHS did not conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs, HHS acted unlawfully by reducing the reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,66,"HHS maintains that there is more to the case than that straightforward analysis would suggest. HHS emphasizes that even when it does not conduct a survey of acquisition costs and thus is required to employ option 2 (based on price), the agency still may adjust the average price as necessary for purposes of this statutory provision. § 1395l(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,67,"It is true that the statutory text of option 2 affords HHS discretion to adjust the average price. The parties here vigorously debate how much HHS may adjust the price. To resolve this case, however, we need not determine the scope of HHS's authority to adjust the price up or down.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,68,"Regardless of the scope of HHS's authority to adjust the average price up or down under the statute, the statute does not grant HHS authority to vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group unless HHS has conducted the required survey of hospitals' acquisition costs. Under the statute, varying a rate by hospital group is not a lesser-included power of adjusting price. Otherwise stated, HHS's power to increase or decrease the price is distinct from its power to set different rates for different groups of hospitals.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,69,"The text of option 2 confirms the point. It requires reimbursement in an amount that is equal to the average price for the drug in the year. Ibid. The text thus requires the reimbursement rate to be set drug by drug, not hospital by hospital or hospital group by hospital group. The only item that the agency is allowed to adjust is the average price for the drug in the year. Ibid. Such an adjustment can consist  of moving the average-price number up or down, but it cannot consist of giving a single drug two different average prices for two different groups of hospitals. (Tellingly, before 2018, the agency never used its adjustment authority to vary reimbursement rates by hospital group.)",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,70,"Moreover, HHS's contrary interpretation of the statute—and its broad understanding of its adjustment authority—would make little sense given the statute's overall structure. To proceed under option 1 (based on cost) and vary the rate by hospital group, HHS must conduct a survey. In HHS's view, the agency can decline to conduct a survey and can proceed under option 2, and then can still do everything under option 2 that it could do under option 1—including varying the reimbursement rates by hospital group. So under HHS's interpretation, the agency would never need to conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs. But why, then, would Congress have constructed this elaborate statute premised on HHS's surveys of hospitals' acquisition costs, including specifying when HHS could vary reimbursement rates by hospital group? HHS has no good answer to that question.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,71,"HHS's interpretation not only would render irrelevant the survey prerequisite for varying reimbursement rates by hospital group, but also would render largely irrelevant the provision of the statute that precisely details the requirements for surveys of hospitals' acquisition costs. See § 1395l(t)(14)(D). We must hesitate to adopt an interpretation that would eviscerate such significant aspects of the statutory text. See, e.g., Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 585, 591, 208 L.Ed.2d 384 (2021), Maine Community Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1308, 1323, 206 L.Ed.2d 764 (2020), Whitman v.

2021-025,72,"In short, the statute allows HHS to set reimbursement rates based on average price and affords the agency discretion to adjust the price up or down. But unless HHS conducts a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs, HHS may not vary the reimbursement rates by hospital group.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,73,"As a final argument, HHS insists that Congress could not have intended for the agency to overpay 340B hospitals for prescription drugs. But when enacting this statute in 2003, Congress was well aware that 340B hospitals paid less for covered prescription drugs. After all, that had been the law for the duration of the 340B program, which began in 1992. In 2003, Congress nonetheless did not see fit to differentiate 340B hospitals from other hospitals when requiring that the reimbursement rates be uniform under option 2. And for more than a decade after this statute took effect, HHS employed option 2 but did not differentiate 340B hospitals from other hospitals—an agency practice that was known in the wider hospital industry and in Congress.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,74,"If HHS believes that this Medicare reimbursement program overpays 340B hospitals, it may conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs to determine whether and how much the data justify varying the reimbursement rates by hospital group— for example, reducing reimbursement rates paid to 340B hospitals as compared to other hospitals. Or if the statute's requirement of an acquisition cost survey is bad policy or is working in unintended ways, HHS can ask Congress to change the law.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,75,"Of course, if HHS went to Congress, the agency would presumably have to confront the other side of the policy story here: 340B hospitals perform valuable services for low-income and rural communities but  have to rely on limited federal funding for support. As amici before this Court, many 340B hospitals contend that the Medicare reimbursement payments at issue here help offset the considerable costs that 340B providers incur by providing health care to the uninsured, underinsured, and those who live far from hospitals and clinics. Brief for 37 State and Regional Hospital Associations as Amici Curiae 7. As the 340B hospitals see it, the net effect of HHS's 2018 and 2019 rules is to redistribute funds from financially strapped, public and nonprofit safety-net hospitals serving vulnerable populations—including patients without any insurance at all—to facilities and individuals who are relatively better off. 967 F.3d at 840 (Pillard, J., dissenting). In other words, in the view of those hospitals, HHS's new rates eliminate the federal subsidy that has helped keep 340B hospitals afloat. All of which is to say that the 340B story may be more complicated than HHS portrays it. In all events, this Court is not the forum to resolve that policy debate.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-025,76,"In sum, after employing the traditional tools of statutory interpretation, we do not agree with HHS's interpretation of the statute.

2021-026,46,"We disagree. Under § 1396k(a)(1)(A), Florida may seek reimbursement from settlement amounts representing payment for medical care, past or future. Thus, because Florida's assignment statute is expressly authorized by the terms of  §1396k(a), it falls squarely within the exception to the anti-lien provision that this Court has recognized. Ahlborn, 547 U.S. at 284, 126 S.Ct. 1752.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,48,"The plain text of § 1396k(a)(1)(A) decides this case. This provision requires the State to acquire from each Medicaid beneficiary an assignment of any rights of the individual  to support  for the purpose of medical care  and to payment for medical care from any third party. § 1396k(a)(1)(A). Nothing in this provision purports to limit a beneficiary's assignment to payment for past medical care already paid for by Medicaid. To the contrary, the grant of any rights  to payment for medical care most naturally covers not only rights to payment for past medical expenses, but also rights to payment for future medical expenses. Ibid. (emphasis added), see United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (The word `any' has an expansive meaning). The relevant distinction is thus between medical and non-medical expenses, Wos, 568 U.S. at 641, 133 S.Ct. 1391, not between past expenses Medicaid has paid and future expenses it has not.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,49,"Statutory context reinforces that § 1396k(a)(1)(A)'s reference to payment for medical care is not limited as Gallardo suggests. First, when § 1396k(a)(1)(A) limits the kind of support (e.g., child support) covered by a beneficiary's assignment, the statute does not single out support allocated for past expenses that a State has already paid. Instead, it requires only that support payments be specified as support for the purpose of medical care generally. § 1396k(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Second, when the Medicaid Act separately requires state plans to comply with § 1396k, it describes that provision as imposing a mandatory assignment of rights of payment for medical support and other medical care owed to recipients. § 1396a(a)(45) (emphasis added). In short, § 1396k(a)(1)(A) and § 1396a(a)(45) distinguish only between medical and nonmedical care, not between past (paid) medical care payments and future (unpaid) medical care payments. If Congress had intended to draw such a distinction, it easily could have drafted language to that effect. Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169, 134 S.Ct. 736, 187 L.Ed.2d 654 (2014).",Thomas,0,
2021-026,50,"In fact, Congress did include such limiting language elsewhere in the Medicaid Act. Section 1396a(a)(25)(H), which requires States to enact laws granting themselves automatic rights to certain third-party payments, contains precisely the limitation that Gallardo would read into the assignment provision. That provision applies only when payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, and covers only third-party payments for such health care items or services. § 1396a(a)(25)(H) (emphasis added). Thus, if § 1396k(a)(1)(A)'s  broad language alone were not dispositive, its contrast with the limiting language in § 1396a(a)(25)(H) would be. Had Congress intended to restrict § 1396k(a)(1)(A) to past expenses Medicaid has paid, it would have done so expressly as it did in § 1396a(a)(25)(H). Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983).",Thomas,0,
2021-026,51,"In sum, because the plain meaning of § 1396k(a)(1)(A), informed by statutory context, allows Florida to seek reimbursement from settlement amounts representing past or future payments for medical care, Florida's assignment provision falls within the exception to the anti-lien provision. Ahlborn, 547 U.S. at 284, 126 S.Ct. 1752.2",Thomas,0,
2021-026,53,"Gallardo nevertheless argues that § 1396k(a)(1)(A) has a different meaning, largely by discounting the text of § 1396k(a)(1)(A) and then relying on other differently worded provisions or on policy arguments, none of which we find convincing.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,54,"Insofar as she confronts § 1396k(a)(1)(A) itself, Gallardo largely focuses on its prefatory clause, which provides that the purpose of the assignment provision is to assist in the collection of medical support payments and other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical assistance under the State plan. § 1396k(a). Gallardo construes this language to limit the assignment provision to payments that are already owed for past medical care provided under the state plan. Brief for Petitioner 30.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,55,"Gallardo's argument misreads the statutory text. The prefatory clause does not refer to payments owed under the State plan, but rather to payments owed to recipients of medical assistance under the State plan. § 1396k(a) (emphasis added). In other words, the prefatory language Gallardo invokes defines to whom the third-party payments are owed—recipients of medical assistance under the State plan. It does not specify the purpose for which those payments must be made. On that score, the prefatory clause refers to medical support and medical care payments, consistent with the adjacent language in § 1396k(a)(1)(A).",Thomas,0,
2021-026,56,"With little support in the text of § 1396k(a)(1)(A), Gallardo proposes that we read the assignment provision to incorporate § 1396a(a)(25)(H)'s more limited language. But as explained above, see supra, at 1758-1759, we must give effect to, not nullify, Congress' choice to include limiting language in some provisions but not others, see Russello, 464 U.S. at 23, 104 S.Ct. 296. Gallardo responds that our decision in Ahlborn eliminated any daylight between § 1396a(a)(25)(H) and § 1396k(a)(1)(A), because we said there that these provisions reiterate, reinforce, and echo each other. 547 U.S. at 276, 280, 281, 126 S.Ct. 1752. But Ahlborn was clear that these two provisions echo or reinforce each other insofar as they both involve recovery of payments  for medical care, id., at 282, 126 S.Ct. 1752, and not payment for, for example, lost wages, id., at 280, 126 S.Ct. 1752. Ahlborn did not suggest that we must otherwise interpret these provisions in lockstep.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,57,"Conceding the provisions' scope could differ, Gallardo argues that the later enacted § 1396a(a)(25)(H) should prevail over the earlier enacted § 1396k(a)(1)(A). Brief for Petitioner 34. But Gallardo does not identify any conflict requiring one of the provisions to prevail. Both provisions require the State to obtain rights—either by assignment or by statute—to certain third-party payments. Because they concern different requirements, they do not conflict just because one is broader in scope than the other. In fact, the provisions complement each other. Section 1396k(a)(1)(A) provides a broad, but not foolproof, contractual right to third-party payments for medical care. See Brief for Respondent 33-34 (explaining circumstances when an assignment under § 1396k(a)(1)(A) might be ineffective). By contrast, § 1396a(a)(25)(H) provides a more targeted statutory right for when the assignment might fail. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28-29 (explaining that, prior to § 1396a(a)(25)(H)'s enactment, insurers were thwarting § 1396k(a)(1)(A) by refusing to recognize assignments and arguing that their insurance contracts forbade assignments (internal quotation marks omitted)).3 Thus, the idea that one of these two complementary provisions must prevail over the other is mistaken.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,58,"Gallardo and the United States also invoke §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) and (B), which require States to take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties  to pay for care and services available under the Medicaid plan and to seek reimbursement  to the extent of such legal liability. They argue that these provisions are the Medicaid Act's main or anchor third-party liability provisions and limit the State's recovery under any other provision to the extent of a third party's payments for care and services available under the plan, §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A)-(B), which they interpret to include only payments for medical care that Medicaid has already covered. Reply Brief 6 (internal quotation marks omitted), see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,59,"This argument suffers from several problems. To begin, it is far from clear that §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) refer only to past expenses the State has already paid. The relevant language—payment for care and services available under the plan—could just as readily refer to payment for medical care available in the future. Regardless, even if this language means what Gallardo says it does, Congress did not use this language to define the scope of an assignment under § 1396k(a)(1)(A), implying again that the  provisions should not be interpreted the same way. See supra, at 1758-1759. This implication is strengthened by the fact that § 1396k(a)(1)(A) was enacted after §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) and (B). It would have been easy for Congress to use the existing language in §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) to define the scope of the mandatory assignment. But it did not.4",Thomas,0,
2021-026,60,"Finally, Gallardo relies on two policy arguments for her preferred interpretation. First, citing a footnote from Ahlborn, she contends that it would be `absurd and fundamentally unjust' for a State to `share in damages for which it has provided no compensation.' 547 U.S. at 288, n. 19, 126 S.Ct. 1752 (quoting Flanigan v. Department of Labor and Industry, 123 Wash.2d 418, 426, 869 P.2d 14, 17 (1994)). Although Ahlborn noted possible unfairness if States were given absolute priority to collect from the entirety of a tort settlement, 547 U.S. at 288, 126 S.Ct. 1752, our holding there was dictated by the Medicaid Act's text, not by our sense of fairness, id., at 280, 126 S.Ct. 1752. Had the text of the Medicaid Act authorized absolute priority, Ahlborn would have been decided differently.",Thomas,0,
2021-026,61,"Second, Gallardo speculates that our reading of § 1396k(a)(1)(A) would authorize a lifetime assignment covering not only the rights an individual has while he is a Medicaid beneficiary but also any rights he acquires in the future when he is no longer a Medicaid beneficiary. Brief for Petitioner 32. Not so. Section 1396k(a)(1)(A) only assigns any rights  of the individual (emphasis added), which is most naturally read as covering those rights the individual possesses while on Medicaid. We must also read § 1396k(a)(1)(A)'s text in light of background legal principles, and it is blackletter law that assignments typically cover only those rights possessed by the assignors at the time of the assignments, United States v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc., 974 F.2d 621, 629 (C.A.5 1992), see also 6A C. J.

Given that legal backdrop, § 1396k(a)(1)(A) cannot cover the sort of lifetime assignment Gallardo invokes.5* * *",Thomas,0,

2021-026,65,"Where a Medicaid beneficiary recovers an award or settlement from a tortfeasor for medical expenses, specific provisions of the Medicaid Act direct a State to reimburse itself from that recovery for care for which it has paid. These provisions constitute a limited exception to the Act's default rule prohibiting a State from imposing a lien against the beneficiary's property or  seeking to use any of that property to reimburse itself. Accordingly, a State may claim portions of the beneficiary's tort award or settlement representing payments for the beneficiary's medical care, but not those representing other compensation to the beneficiary (e.g., damages for lost wages or pain and suffering). Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U.S. 268, 282-286, 126 S.Ct. 1752, 164 L.Ed.2d 459 (2006).

It holds that States may reimburse themselves for medical care furnished on behalf of a beneficiary not only from the portions of the beneficiary's settlement representing compensation for Medicaid-furnished care, but also from settlement funds that compensate the Medicaid beneficiary for future medical care for which Medicaid has not paid and might never pay. The Court does so by reading one statutory provision in isolation while giving short shrift to the statutory context, the relationships between the provisions at issue, and the framework set forth in precedent. The Court's holding is inconsistent with the structure of the Medicaid program and will cause needless unfairness and disruption. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,

See ante, at 1755-1756. It devotes comparatively little attention to another central requirement: that a State not assert claims against the property of Medicaid beneficiaries or recipients.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,69,"Under the Medicaid Act's anti-lien provision, enacted in 1965 as part of the original Act, no lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance provided under the state Medicaid plan, whether paid or to be paid. § 1396p(a)(1), see Ahlborn, 547 U.S. at 283-284, 126 S.Ct. 1752. In addition, the Act's anti-recovery provision, also enacted in 1965, provides that no adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan may be made. § 1396p(b)(1). Together, the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions establish that acceptance of Medicaid does not render a beneficiary indebted to the State or give the State any claim to the beneficiary's property. In other words, Medicaid is not a loan. If a Medicaid beneficiary's financial circumstances change and a beneficiary gains the ability to pay for his or her own medical expenses, the beneficiary is not obligated to repay the State for past expenses, no matter the magnitude of the change in circumstances. Rather, the ordinary consequence is that the individual simply becomes ineligible for benefits moving forward.1  In Ahlborn, this Court held that the Medicaid provisions enabling the State to seek reimbursement from third parties liable for a beneficiary's medical care (discussed in detail below) establish a narrow exception to the anti-lien provision. The exception applies where the beneficiary directly sues a tortfeasor for payment of medical costs.2 As a threshold matter, the Court held that a beneficiary's settlement proceeds qualified as beneficiary property protected by the anti-lien provision unless an exception to that provision applied. Id., at 285-286, 126 S.Ct. 1752. The Court further held that Medicaid's assignment to the State of rights to reimbursement from third parties carved out an exception to the anti-lien provision permitting the State to recover that portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care. Id., at 282, 284-285, 126 S.Ct. 1752.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,70,"Importantly, the Ahlborn Court rejected the State's claim that it could seek reimbursement more broadly from the remainder of the settlement funds.

As relevant to the case before it, the Ahlborn Court concluded that the State could not recover from portions of a settlement representing compensation for damages distinct from medical costs—like pain and suffering, lost wages, and loss of future earnings. 547 U.S. at 272, 126 S.Ct. 1752. The Court noted that it would be unfair to the recipient and `absurd' for the State to `share in damages for which it has provided no compensation.'

2021-026,72,"The Court summarizes Florida's Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act and the facts of petitioner Gianinna Gallardo's case. See ante, at 1756-1758. The question presented is whether the exception to the anti-lien provision recognized in Ahlborn extends to permit Florida to claim the share of Gallardo's settlement allocated for her future medical expenses as compensation for the State's expenditures for her past medical expenses.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,73,"Before answering that question, a note is in order about what is not in dispute. Consider a hypothetical example in which Florida has spent $1,000 on a beneficiary's medical care, after which the beneficiary secures a $1,500 tort settlement, $200 of which is allocated for those already-incurred medical expenses, $500 of which is allocated for future medical care, and the remainder of which ($800) compensates for nonmedical expenses. The parties agree, as they must, that Florida cannot recover anticipated expenses for services it has not furnished, but may pursue reimbursement only for expenses it has paid (i.e., Florida can recover no more than $1,000). The parties further agree that Florida can recover these expenses from the portion of the beneficiary's settlement allocated for  these expenses (i.e., the $200), and that Florida can challenge the allocation of the settlement if it contends that too low a portion was designated for past medical expenses. The parties also do not dispute that Florida cannot recover from the $800 representing nonmedical expenses. The only dispute is whether Florida also may recover its past medical costs from the distinct portion of the beneficiary's settlement representing future medical expenses (i.e., the $500)—expenses it has not paid and might never pay. Under a proper reading of the applicable statutory provisions in context, Florida may not do so.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,74,"As Ahlborn explains, Florida's ability to seek reimbursement from Gallardo's settlement hinges on establishing that an exception to the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions applies. Several provisions, enacted over a span of decades, set forth the exception relevant here. The first, §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) (collectively, the third-party liability provision), was enacted three years after the Medicaid Act and the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions. The third-party liability provision authorizes a State only to recover for medical assistance that has been made available on behalf of the individual, and only after medical assistance has been made available. § 1396a(a)(25)(B) (emphasis added). And it authorizes recovery only to the extent of, ibid., the legal liability of third parties  to pay for care and services available under the plan, § 1396a(a)(25)(A). In this context, the provision's reference to care available under the plan can only be understood to refer to care that is available by virtue of having been paid under the plan, not care that theoretically may or may not be made available in the future. Put differently, as a textual matter, this provision extends only to a third party's liability to pay for services actually furnished by a state plan.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,75,"Congress subsequently enacted two legal tools for a State to use when seeking reimbursement, consistent with the third-party liability provision, for services paid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,76,"The first of these tools is the assignment provision, § 1396k(a)(1)(A), enacted in 1977 and made mandatory in 1984. In that provision, to assist in the collection of payments for medical care, § 1396k(a), Congress required each state Medicaid plan to condition eligibility on assignment of any rights of the beneficiary to payment for medical care from any third party, § 1396k(a)(1)(A). Florida rests its argument on the understanding that this language confers upon it a right to recover payments designated for medical care regardless of whether those payments compensate for medical care for which Florida actually has paid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,77,"Several textual signals foreclose Florida's interpretation of the assignment provision. For one, the provision, by its terms, does not stand alone. Instead, Congress enacted it for the purpose of assisting in a State's collection of payments for medical care owed to beneficiaries. § 1396k(a). It would be anomalous, then, to read the provision to reach beyond the third-party liability provision it assists in implementing. Ibid., see Guam v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1608, 1613-1614, 209 L.Ed.2d 691 (2021) (similarly interpreting a statutory provision in light of an earlier anchor provision). Supporting that understanding, Congress later amended the statute containing the assignment provision to require beneficiaries to cooperate with the State in identifying  any third party who may be liable to pay for care and services available under the plan. § 1396k(a)(1)(C) (the cooperation provision). The cooperation provision echoes the third-party liability provision's focus on care available under the plan. Ibid. It would be bizarre for  Congress to mandate a more far-reaching assignment of a beneficiary's right to payment for all medical support, paid or unpaid, but limit the beneficiary's duty to cooperate only to services paid. Finally, another provision of the Act directs each State to pass laws requiring insurers to accept  the assignment to the State of any right of an individual or other entity to payment  for an item or service for which payment has been made under the State plan. § 1396a(a)(25)(I)(ii). In this insurer acceptance provision, Congress described the assignment provision's mandate as specific to third-party payments for services the State plan has funded. Taken together, these textual indicators establish that the assignment provision reaches only a third party's liability for services made available by Medicaid, not liability for services for which Medicaid has not paid and may never pay.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,78,"The second tool Congress enacted to implement the third-party liability provision is the acquisition provision, § 1396a(a)(25)(H). A 1990 General Accounting Office report found that some health insurers were thwarting the assignment provision by refusing to pay States for any of several reasons, including by declining to recognize Medicaid assignments or by insisting that such assignments conflicted with their insurance contracts. Medicaid: Legislation Needed to Improve Collections From Private Insurers 5 (GAO/HRD-91-25, Nov.). Congress addressed this in 1993 by directing each State to enact laws under which the State automatically acquires a beneficiary's rights to third-party payments specifically for health care items or services furnished to the beneficiary, without the need for separate assignments. § 1396a(a)(25)(H). The text of this acquisition provision, too, clearly restricts a State's acquisition to the portion of a third-party payment pertaining to health care items or services for which payment has been made under the State plan and does not extend to third-party payments for services the plan has not furnished. Ibid., see ante, at 1758-1759.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,79,"This Court's task is to interpret these provisions `as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme' while `fitting all parts into an harmonious whole.' FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). Doing so here leads to only one symmetrical and coherent conclusion: that the assignment and acquisition provisions work in tandem to effectuate the third-party liability provision. As explained by the United States as amicus curiae in support of Gallardo, Congress added the belt (the acquisition provision) because it feared that the suspenders (the assignment provision) were not doing their job. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. The two provisions take different paths toward the same goal, and each reinforces the other. All of the provisions enable a State to reimburse itself for expenses it has paid, not for expenses it may or may not incur in the future. None of the provisions authorize a State to seek such reimbursement from the portions of a beneficiary's tort settlement representing payments for care for which the State has not paid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,80,"This interpretation is also consistent with the structure of the Medicaid program as a whole, under which a State's recovery from a beneficiary's compensation in tort is permissible under a narrow exception to the general, asset-protective rule established by the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions. Ahlborn further explained that the third-party liability provision and acquisition provision both reinforced the limitation implicit in the assignment provision. 547 U.S. at 280, 126 S.Ct. 1752. In particular, the  Court described the acquisition provision's requirement (that a State enact laws under which it acquires a beneficiary's rights to third-party payments for health care items or services furnished to an individual under the State plan, § 1396a(a)(25)(H)) as reiterating and echoing the assignment provision's requirement (that a state plan condition eligibility on a beneficiary's assignment of rights to payment). Id., at 276, 281, 126 S.Ct. 1752. Ahlborn's repeated recognition of the relationships between these three provisions cannot be squared with Florida's primary argument, which would sever the provisions and read the assignment provision to eclipse the limitations of the other two.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,81,"Moreover, Medicaid is an insurance statute, and Ahlborn's discussion of the unfairness that would ensue from a State's `sharing in damages for which it has provided no compensation,' id., at 288, n. 19, 126 S.Ct. 1752, tracks background principles of insurance law. Under those principles, recovery by an insurer against a third party is generally limited to the same elements as those for which the insurer has made payment, absent contractual terms to the contrary. 16 S. Plitt, D. Maldonado, J. Rogers, & J. Plitt, Couch on Insurance § 226:36 (3d ed. 2021), see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-22. This, too, supports a cohesive reading of these provisions as allowing States to recover their past expenses only from sources that compensate for the care and services state plans actually have furnished.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,82,"An additional absurdity would flow from an overbroad reading of the assignment provision decoupled from its companions. Florida maintains that the assignment provision's reference to any rights  to payment for medical care from any third party, § 1396k(a)(1)(A), permits recovery from settlement funds compensating for all medical expenses, past or future. If this provision were interpreted in isolation to sweep so broadly, however, its text would place no temporal limitation on the rights assigned to the State. For example, if Medicaid were to fund an individual's medical care as a teenager, the State would be entitled to recover the costs of that care from any unrelated future tort settlement for medical expenses, regardless of whether the individual remained on Medicaid or the state plan furnished any services related to those future injuries. Such a nonsensical lifetime assignment, Brief for Petitioner 32, would constitute an unfair erosion of the anti-lien provision, Ahlborn, 547 U.S. at 288, 126 S.Ct. 1752, contravening Congress' careful design. In contrast, a harmonious reading of the statute, consistent with Ahlborn, limits the funds from which a State may recover to those awarded for expenses paid and therefore presents no such concern.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,84,"Despite the foregoing, the Court reads the assignment provision standing alone to establish, unlike all the other provisions of the Act at issue, a substantially broader right to recover from payments for all medical care, whether paid by the State or  not. The Court commits several errors on the path to its holding, which departs from the statutory scheme as understood in Ahlborn and forces the Court to adopt an implausible workaround in order to mitigate the absurd consequence, discussed above, of its acontextual reading.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,86,"The Court's analysis starts off backward. The Court states first that the Act requires a State to condition Medicaid eligibility on assignment of rights, and only then notes that the anti-lien provision also limits States' recovery efforts. Ante, at 1755-1756. In fact, the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions establish a general rule, and the subsequently enacted third-party liability provision and its companions create a limited exception. That exception, in turn, should not be construed to the farthest reach of its linguistic possibility if that result would contravene the statutory design. Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 60, 133 S.Ct. 2191, 186 L.Ed.2d 275 (2013). The Court's misframing, however, causes it to displace the background principle of the anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions by relying on language in the assignment provision that is vague at best.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,87,"The Court places great weight on the assignment provision's use of the word any in its reference to rights  to payment for medical care. § 1396k(a)(1)(A), see ante, at 1758. The Court presumes that `the word any has an expansive meaning.' Ibid. But whether the word any indicates an intent to sweep broadly necessarily depends on the statutory context. National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 617, 629, 199 L.Ed.2d 501 (2018). Here, as explained, statutory context establishes that the word does not bear the heavy weight the Court puts upon it. Ibid. To the extent the Court suggests the word any supersedes all other contrary contextual indications, it ignores precedent. See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U.S. 350, 356-358, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994) (relying on context to interpret `any law-enforcement officer or law-enforcement agency' as limited to those making arrests under federal law).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,88,"The Court also repeatedly relies on the fact that the acquisition provision and third-party liability provision use specific language to limit the pool from which a State may recover to funds that compensate for expenses Medicaid has paid, whereas the assignment provision uses different language. See ante, at 1758-1759, 1759-1760, 1760-1761. The Court invokes the presumption that `where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983). This is unpersuasive. Putting aside the many contextual clues that support Gallardo's reading of the assignment provision, see supra, at 1764-1765, the presumption the Court cites is `strongest' in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were `considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.' Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U.S. 474, 486, 128 S.Ct. 1931, 170 L.Ed.2d 887 (2008). It has less force where, as here, different Congresses enacted the provisions at issue over the course of multiple decades. The presumption is especially unhelpful in this case because it cuts both ways: Since 1965, the anti-lien provision has specified that a State may not impose a lien against a beneficiary's property on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf. § 1396p(a)(1) (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,89,"Accepting the Court's logic, Congress should have required an assignment that unambiguously reached payments for both furnished and unfurnished care using this existing paid or to be paid language, but it failed to do so in the assignment provision. See ante, at 1760-1761.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,90,"Meanwhile, the Court fails to give due regard to the clear textual limitations imposed by the Act as a whole. For instance, as to the assignment provision's mirror image in the insurer acceptance provision, see supra, at 1764-1765, the Court reasons that the latter's narrower focus on health insurers, who typically pay only once medical services are rendered, explains its application to a narrower category of third-party payments, ante, at 1760, n. 3. This is beside the point. In the assignment provision, Congress required beneficiaries to assign certain rights to the State, in the insurer acceptance provision, it required insurers to accept that assignment. It makes no sense that Congress would require insurers to accept only a sliver of the mandatory assignment, regardless of how insurers typically pay.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,91,"Ultimately, statutory construction  is a holistic endeavor. United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371, 108 S.Ct. 626, 98 L.Ed.2d 740 (1988). Yet rather than reading the assignment provision in a manner compatible with the rest of the law, ibid., the Court disconnects it from much of the Act. The Court does not hold that the third-party liability provision extends as far as its reading of the assignment provision. See ante, at 1760-1761, see also supra, at 1763-1764. The Court also agrees that the acquisition provision is more limited, meaning that the scope of that provision, too, differs from that of the assignment provision. Ante, at 1759-1760. To justify these anomalies, the Court asserts that Congress, in enacting the acquisition provision, saw fit to provide a more targeted statutory right for when the assignment might fail. Ibid. The Court offers little explanation, however, for why Congress might have narrowed such a necessary backstop in this way. The statutory hodgepodge the Court perceives contrasts sharply with the reasonable scheme Congress actually crafted.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,93,"The Court's reasoning also contradicts precedent. The Court distinguishes Ahlborn because that case did not squarely hold that the relevant provisions must be interpreted in lockstep, and it reduces Ahlborn's concern about fairness to a disfavored policy argument that must yield to text. Ante, at 1759-1760, 1760-1761. But Ahlborn's analysis reflected the Court's view of the text and context of the Act as a cohesive whole. It is not only our sense of fairness, ante, at 1761, but Congress' sense of fairness, as codified in the Act's anti-lien and anti-recovery provisions and recognized in Ahlborn, that demonstrates the Court's error.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,94,"The Court itself appears to recognize that its textual analysis leads to unfair and absurd results, leading it to suggest an unpersuasive workaround. The Court responds to the lifetime-assignment quandary, see supra, at 1766-1767, by reasoning that the assignment provision's use of the phrase `any rights  of the individual' is most naturally read to impose a temporal limitation to rights possessed while on Medicaid, ante, at 1760-1761. Neither party even suggests this reading of the statute.4 That is because it is anything but natural, especially under the interpretive  approach the Court uses today. An individual continues to be an individual for the duration of his or her life, whether on or off Medicaid. Were there any ambiguity, the word `any,' we are told, `has an expansive meaning' that would counsel against the Court's implicit limitation. Ante, at 1758. Perhaps sensing that its claim to natural meaning lacks force, the Court, at last, acknowledges background legal principles that militate against allowing a lifetime assignment. Ante, at 1761. While background principles indisputably are relevant, the Court errs by discarding the more relevant background rule of insurance law that Congress embraced in the Act, see supra, at 1766, which could have avoided the Court's dilemma altogether.5",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,95,"Over the long term, the Court's alteration of the balance Congress struck between preserving Medicaid's status as payer of last resort and protecting Medicaid beneficiaries' property might frustrate both aims. As a State's right of recovery from any damages payout expands, a Medicaid beneficiary's share shrinks, reducing the beneficiary's incentive to pursue a tort action in the first place. See Brief for American Justice Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16-20. Under the provisions of the Act at issue here, States may sue tortfeasors directly, but as Florida itself explains, it is more cost-effective for beneficiaries to sue. Tr. of Oral Arg. 65. By diminishing beneficiaries' interests in doing so, the Court's expansion of States' assignment rights could perversely cause States to recover fewer overall expenses, all while unsettling expectations in the States that have relied on a contrary reading of federal law.6",Sotomayor,0,
2021-026,96,"In the end, the Court's atomizing interpretation has little to commend it, particularly when contrasted with the consistent, administrable scheme Congress crafted. The Court's reading also undercuts Congress' choice to allow Medicaid beneficiaries to place their excess recovery funds in Special Needs Trusts, protecting their ability to pay for important expenses Medicaid will not cover. See n. 1, supra. Congress may wish to intercede to address any disruption that ensues from today's decision, but under a proper reading of the Act, such intervention would have been unnecessary.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

2021-027,29,"The Medicare program reimburses hospitals at higher-than-usual rates when they serve a higher-than-usual percentage of low-income patients. The enhanced rates are calculated by adding together two fractions, called the Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction. Roughly speaking, the former measures the hospital's low-income senior-citizen population, and the latter the hospital's low-income non-senior population.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,30,"This case raises a technical but important question about the Medicare fraction. The statutory description of that fraction refers to the number of a hospital's patient days attributable to low-income patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of Medicare. 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a person is entitled to Part A benefits under the statute if he qualifies for the Medicare program—essentially, if he is over 65 or disabled. That remains so even when Medicare is not paying for part or all of his hospital stay— for example, because a private insurer is legally responsible or because he has used up his allotted coverage. Today, we approve HHS's understanding of the Medicare fraction.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,32,"The Medicare program provides Government-funded health insurance to over 64 million elderly or disabled Americans. (The vast majority of that number are senior citizens.) When a person turns 65 or has received federal disability benefits for 24 months, he automatically (i.e., without application or other filing) becomes entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A. §§ 426(a)-(b). The most significant Part A benefit is coverage for inpatient hospital treatment, Part A also covers associated physician and skilled nursing services. See § 1395d(a), HHS, CMS Ruling No. CMS-1498-R, p. 10 (Apr. 28, 2010), https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/rulings/downloads/cms1498r.pdf (CMS-1498-R). In addition, entitlement to Part A generally enables a patient to enroll (if he wishes) in Medicare's other programs: Part B's coverage for outpatient care, Part C's coverage through privately administered Medicare Advantage plans, and Part D's coverage for prescription drugs. See §§ 1395o(a)(1), 1395w-21(a)(3), 1395w-101(a)(3)(A).",Kagan,0,
2021-027,33,"The Medicare program pays a hospital a fixed rate for treating each Medicare patient, based on the patient's diagnosis and regardless of the hospital's actual costs. §§ 1395ww(d)(1)-(4). The rates are designed to reflect the amounts an efficiently run hospital, in the same region, would expend to treat a patient with the same diagnosis. See 42 C.F.R. § 412.2 (2022). If the hospital spends anything more, it suffers a financial loss. The flat-rate payment system thus gives hospitals an incentive to provide efficient levels of medical service.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,34,"But Congress, recognizing complexity in healthcare, provided for various hospital-specific rate adjustments—including the one at issue here for treating low-income patients. The disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustment gives hospitals serving an unusually high percentage of low-income patients enhanced Medicare payments. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. 145, 150, 133 S.Ct. 817, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013). The mark-up reflects that low-income individuals are often more expensive to treat than higher income ones, even for the same medical conditions. In compensating for that disparity, the DSH adjustment encourages hospitals to treat low-income patients.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,35,"To calculate a hospital's DSH adjustment, HHS adds together two statutorily described fractions, usually called the Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction. Those fractions are designed to capture two different low-income populations that a hospital serves. The Medicare fraction represents the proportion of a hospital's Medicare patients who have low incomes, as identified by their entitlement to supplementary security income (SSI) benefits. SSI is a welfare program providing benefits to financially needy individuals who (like Medicare patients generally) are over 65 or disabled. Bowen v. Galbreath, 485 U.S. 74, 75, 108 S.Ct. 892, 99 L.Ed.2d 68 (1988), see §§ 1382(a)(1), 1382c(a)(1). The Medicaid fraction represents the proportion of a hospital's patients who are not entitled to Medicare and have low incomes, as identified by their eligibility for Medicaid. The Medicaid program provides health insurance to all low-income individuals, regardless of age or disability. See § 1396d(a). So at a high level of generality, the Medicare fraction is a measure of a hospital's senior (or disabled) low-income population, while the Medicaid fraction is a measure of a hospital's non-senior (except for disabled) low-income population.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,36,"With that under your belt, you might be ready to absorb the relevant statutory language (but don't bet on it). The Medicare fraction is described as:  a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of a hospital's patient days for the fiscal year which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of Medicare and were entitled to SSI benefits, and the denominator of which is the number of such hospital's patient days for such fiscal year which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under Medicare part A. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F) (vi)(I).",Kagan,0,
2021-027,37,"That is a mouthful (and without the brackets, it's even worse). So again, in general terms: The numerator is the number of patient days attributable to Medicare patients who are poor. The denominator is the number of patient days attributable to all Medicare patients. Divide the former by the latter to get the fraction expressed as a percentage. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,38,And similarly for the Medicaid fraction. That fraction is described as:,Kagan,0,
2021-027,39,"a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of a hospital's patient days for the fiscal year which consist of patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid, but who were not entitled to benefits under part A of Medicare, and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's patient days for such fiscal year. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(II).",Kagan,0,
2021-027,40,"That too is a lot to digest. So again, in general terms: The numerator is the number of patient days attributable to non-Medicare patients who are poor. The denominator is the total number of patient days. Divide the former by the latter to get the second percentage the DSH calculation requires.1",Kagan,0,
2021-027,41,"Once both percentages have been calculated, they are added together to produce the disproportionate-patient percentage. That percentage determines whether a hospital will receive a DSH adjustment, and if so, how large it will be. The combined percentage must usually equal or exceed 15% for a hospital to get an adjustment. See § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(v). So, for example, if a hospital's Medicare fraction is 10% and its Medicaid fraction is 5%, then the hospital would qualify for increased rates. The higher the disproportionate-patient percentage goes, the greater the rate mark-up that the hospital will receive. §§ 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vii)-(xiv).",Kagan,0,
2021-027,42,"This case is about how to count patients who qualify for Medicare Part A—because they are over 65 or disabled—at times when the program is not paying for their hospital treatment. Such non-payment may occur for a number of reasons. For one, Medicare usually pays for only the first 90 days of a hospital stay associated with a single spell of illness. See § 1395d, 42 C.F.R. § 409.61(a). If a patient's stay for an illness exceeds that limit, his coverage is exhausted. § 409.61(a). For another, Medicare pays for hospital treatment only  once a patient has used up other medical insurance. See § 1395y(b)(2)(A). So if a patient has a private insurance plan, or is injured by a tortfeasor with insurance, Medicare will not pay unless and until that other policy runs dry. Limits like those prompt the question presented here: Are patients whom Medicare insures but does not pay for on a given day entitled to Medicare Part A benefits, for purposes of computing a hospital's disproportionate-patient percentage? §§ 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I-II).",Kagan,0,
2021-027,43,"An HHS regulation, issued in 2004, says those patients remain so entitled. See 69 Fed. Reg. 48916. Under the regulation, whether Medicare is actually paying for a patient's hospital treatment is irrelevant. So, for example, it does not matter that a patient has exhausted his 90 days of coverage for an illness, or that a private insurer is paying for his hospital stay. As long as the patient meets the basic statutory criteria for Medicare (i.e., he is over 65 or disabled), then the patient counts in the denominator and, if he is poor, in the numerator of the Medicare fraction (as entitled to Medicare Part A benefits). See id., at 49098-49099. And by the same token, he does not count in the numerator of the Medicaid fraction (which includes only those not entitled to Medicare Part A benefits). See ibid. As HHS explained in 2004, the effect of the regulation varies depending on the makeup of a hospital's patient population. See ibid. But for most hospitals, the regulation has worked to decrease DSH payments, because as beneficiaries are added to the Medicare fraction's denominator (even though poor beneficiaries are also added to its numerator), a hospital's Medicare fraction generally (though not always) goes down. See Letter from E. Prelogar, Solicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court (Nov. 23, 2021).",Kagan,0,
2021-027,44,"Respondent Empire Health Foundation challenged the regulation as inconsistent with the statutory fraction descriptions, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed. See Empire Health Foundation v. Azar, 958 F.3d 873 (2020). The court focused on the statute's use of two different phrases: entitled to Medicare Part A benefits and (in the Medicaid fraction alone) eligible for Medicaid assistance. Id., at 885. Relying on Circuit precedent, the court read the latter, eligible phrase to mean that a patient simply meets the Medicaid statutory criteria— regardless of whether Medicaid actually paid for a given service on a given day. Ibid. That approach, of course, is analogous to the one the HHS regulation adopts for Medicare beneficiaries. But the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the statutory language relating to Medicare is different: It asks whether a person is entitled to (not eligible for) benefits. And the word entitled, the court held (relying on the same precedent), means that a patient has an `absolute right  to payment.' Ibid. (ellipsis in original). So even if a patient is over 65, he is not entitled to Medicare Part A benefits within the meaning of the statute for any hospital stay, or part thereof, Medicare is not paying for.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,45,"As the Ninth Circuit recognized, two other Courts of Appeals had deferred to HHS's contrary view of the statute and upheld the regulation. See Metropolitan Hospital v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 712 F.3d 248 (C.A.6 2013), Catholic Health Initiatives Iowa Corp. v. Sebelius, 718 F.3d 914 (C.A.D.C. 2013). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. See 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2883, 210 L.Ed.2d 990 (2021).2  II",Kagan,0,
2021-027,46,"HHS's regulation correctly construes the statutory language at issue. The ordinary meaning of the fraction descriptions, as is obvious to any ordinary reader, does not exactly leap off the page. See Catholic Health Initiatives, 718 F.3d at 916 (The language is downright byzantine). The provisions are technical: They call to mind Justice Frankfurter's injunction that when a statute is addressed to specialists, it must be read by judges with the minds of the specialists. Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 536 (1947). But when read in that suitable way, the fraction descriptions disclose a surprisingly clear meaning—the one chosen by HHS. The text and context support the agency's reading: HHS has interpreted the words in those provisions to mean just what they mean throughout the Medicare statute. And so too the structure of the DSH provisions supports HHS: Counting everyone who qualifies for Medicare benefits in the Medicare fraction—and no one who qualifies for those benefits in the Medicaid fraction —accords with the statute's attempt to capture, through two separate measurements, two different segments of a hospital's low-income patient population.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,48,"Speaking of twos, Empire's textual argument also has a bifurcated structure—but neither part can produce its desired result. Empire primarily contends, echoing the Ninth Circuit, that different words mean different things when used in a single statute—and so entitled means something different from eligible. Brief for Respondent 22. To be eligible for a benefit, Empire says, is to be qualified to seek it, to be entitled to a benefit means instead to have an absolute right to its payment. Id., at 4, 30. But that reading, even if plausible in the abstract, does not work in the Medicare statute. There, entitled to benefits is essentially a term of art, used over and over to mean qualifying (or, yes, being eligible) for benefits—i.e., being over 65 or disabled. And in the end, Empire basically concedes that point. It must devise a way to give entitled to benefits a different meaning in the fraction descriptions than the phrase has everywhere else in the Medicare law. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-41. So Empire shifts gears, relying now on the parenthetical phrase (for such days) to do its work—to transform the usual statutory meaning of entitled to benefits to something different and novel. See ibid., § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I) (patients who (for such days) were entitled to Medicare Part A benefits). (The dissent, for its part, focuses most of its energies on this latter stage of Empire's argument.) But those three little words do not accomplish what Empire would like, having the much less radical function of excluding days of a patient's hospital stay before he qualifies for Medicare (e.g., turns 65). So contrary to Empire's claim, being entitled to Medicare benefits still means—in the fraction descriptions, as throughout the statute —meeting the basic statutory criteria, not actually receiving payment for a given day's treatment.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,50,"First and foremost, the Medicare statute explicitly identifies which individuals are entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A—all people who meet the basic statutory criteria. §§ 426(a)-(b). Every individual, the law states, who has attained age 65 and is entitled to ordinary social security payments shall be entitled  to Medicare Part A benefits. § 426(a). So too, every individual under age 65 who has been entitled to federal disability benefits for at least 24 months shall be entitled to Medicare Part A benefits. § 426(b). The entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (as the section caption reads) is automatic: Age or disability makes a person entitled to Part A benefits without an application or anything more. § 426, Hall v. Sebelius, 667 F.3d 1293, 1294-1296 (C.A.D.C. 2012). Turn 65 or receive disability benefits for 24 months, and you have an entitlement to Part A benefits—because the latter is, according to the statute, simply a legal status arising from the former.3",Kagan,0,
2021-027,51,"That broad meaning of entitlement coexists with limitations on payment, as several statutory provisions show. The entitlement to benefits, the statute repeatedly says, is an entitlement to payment under specified conditions. To quote one provision: entitlement of an individual to Medicare Part A benefits consists of entitlement to have payment made under, and subject to the limitations in, part A. § 426(c)(1), see § 1395d(a) (similarly stating that the entitlement to benefits entails the receipt of payments  subject to the provisions of this part). Those limits on payment include, as described earlier, the 90-day hospital-stay cap. See supra, at 2360-2361. And indeed the statute twice refers to patients who are entitled to benefits under part A but have exhausted benefits for inpatient hospital services. §§ 1395l(a)(8)(B)(i), 1395l(t)(1)(B)(ii). Under Empire's reading, that statement makes no sense: A patient is not, Empire argues, entitled to benefits when the statute precludes payment. See supra, at 2362. But the statute says otherwise. It considers those who have exhausted their coverage (and so cannot receive further payments for a hospital stay) still entitled to Part A benefits.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,52,"In thus describing the Part A entitlement, the Medicare statute reflects the complexity of health insurance. Consider your own health plan (maybe it is Medicare). You might have hit some limit on coverage as to one medical service—let's say, eye care. But you're still insured: Your policy will pay for more eye care in the next coverage period and meanwhile will pay for your knee replacement. So it is with Medicare Part A. As the 2004 regulation explains, patients who have exhausted their Medicare Part A inpatient coverage may still be entitled to other Part A benefits. 69 Fed. Reg. 49098. Medicare Part A also covers, for example, certain physician services and skilled nursing services outside the hospital setting. See CMS-1498-R, at 10. And even as to hospital care, another 90 days of coverage will be available for another illness. See supra, at 2360-2361. For that reason among others, HHS has noted, the stoppage of payment for any given service cannot be thought to affect the broader statutory entitlement to Part A benefits. See 69 Fed.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,53,Reg. 49098. That entitlement arises when a person meets the basic statutory qualifications and (unless a disability diminishes) never goes away.,Kagan,0,
2021-027,54,"If entitled to Part A benefits instead bore Empire's meaning, Medicare beneficiaries would lose important rights and protections. Perhaps most significantly, a patient could lose his ability to enroll in other Medicare programs whenever he lacked a right to Part A payments for hospital care. As noted earlier, a person's entitlement to Part A benefits is usually the predicate for his enrollment in Part B (covering outpatient care), Part C (providing coverage through privately managed plans), or Part D (offering prescription-drug benefits). See §§ 1395o(a), 1395w-21(a)(3), 1395w-101(a)(3)(A), supra, at 2358-2359. So if (as Empire urges) a hospitalized patient is not entitled to Part A benefits on any day he cannot get Part A payments, then he could be locked out of the benefits of Parts B through D at that time. Consider what that might mean in the real world: A Medicare patient in the hospital for longer than 90 days—by definition, a very ill person— could not enroll in Part D's prescription-drug coverage. Congress could not have wanted—and in fact did not provide for— that result.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,55,"Empire's interpretation would also make a hash of provisions designed to inform Medicare beneficiaries of their benefits. The statute requires annual notice to individuals entitled to benefits under part A concerning all available program benefits, including any limitations on payment. § 1395b-2(a). Under Empire's reading, that notice requirement would phase in and out depending on whether Medicare Part A was currently paying for the individual's hospital treatment. HHS, for example, would have no obligation to inform a patient of benefits when a private insurer was paying for his hospital care, even if that policy would soon run out and Medicare would assume the coverage. Once again, Congress would not have drafted such an on-again, off-again notice requirement.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,56,"So too, Empire's reading of entitled to Part A benefits would subvert a provision to protect beneficiaries from misleading marketing materials. Under the statute, an insurer offering a Part C (privately managed Medicare) plan may not distribute advertising materials to eligible beneficiaries unless the materials are first cleared by HHS. See § 1395w-21(h)(1). Eligible beneficiaries are individuals entitled to benefits under Part A and enrolled in Part B. § 1395w-21(a)(3). If Empire is right about what the entitled to phrase means, an insurer could send whatever it wanted to a patient who at that time lacked a right to Part A payments. But such a person might well be interested in eventually enrolling in a Part C plan—and he is no less vulnerable to deceptive marketing than anyone else.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,57,"And the problems with Empire's interpretation do not stop there. The Sixth and D. C. Circuits have cataloged several other statutory provisions that Empire's reading would render unworkable or unthinkable or both. See Metropolitan Hospital, 712 F.3d at 260, Northeast Hospital Corp. v. Sebelius, 657 F.3d 1, 6-11 (C.A.D.C. 2011). We could spell out each one in painful detail, but we think the above should suffice. Applying Empire's reading of entitled to Part A benefits across the Medicare statute would diminish the beneficiary protections Congress wrote into law. Those safeguards would apply or not apply, or fluctuate constantly between the two, based on the happenstance of whether Medicare paid for hospital care on a given day. Once again, that is not the statute Congress wrote.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,59,"Faced with these many provisions, Empire swerves. Empire effectively (if reluctantly) concedes that its reading of entitled to Part A benefits—again, to have an absolute right to Part A payments— cannot be applied throughout the Medicare statute. Brief for Respondent 30, see id., at 41-42, Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39. There, over and over—and contra the main thrust of Empire's arguments—the concepts of entitlement and eligibility are the same. So Empire must come up with a way of converting the ordinary meaning of entitled in the Medicare law to something different in its fraction provisions. The lever Empire proposes to use for that purpose is the parenthetical phrase (for such days). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-39 (The key distinction is for such days, which is language that's not found anywhere else). Empire argues that when entitled is married to (for such days)—recall the whole phrase, patients who (for such days) were entitled to Part A benefits—the idea of entitlement morphs. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). Now it does not mean meeting Medicare's statutory (age or disability) criteria on the days in question, but instead means actually receiving Medicare payments. (The dissent makes much the same argument.)",Kagan,0,
2021-027,60,"But we cannot understand Congress to have changed the statute's consistent meaning of entitled to benefits simply by adding (for such days). That slight phrase is incapable of bearing so much interpretive weight. If Congress does not alter the fundamentals of a statutory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions, then it ordinarily does not do so in parentheticals either. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). To the contrary, a parenthetical is typically used to convey an aside or after-thought. Boechler v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1493, 1498, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (internal quotation marks omitted). And nothing about the (for such days) parenthetical signals anything different. Empire asks us to read it as transforming the uniform statutory meaning of entitled to benefits for the fraction provisions alone. But if Congress had wanted to accomplish that unexpected object, it would simply have said so. Or else, to make only paid-for days count, it would have dropped the language of entitlement altogether. What it would not have done is upend the settled meaning of that language, in this one place, through so subtle, indirect, and opaque a mechanism.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,61,"The (for such days) phrase instead works as HHS says: hand in hand with the ordinary statutory meaning of entitled to Part A benefits. The parenthetical no doubt tells HHS to ask about a patient on a given day. But the query the agency must make is not whether that patient on that day has received Part A payments, the query is, consistent with what entitled means all over the statute, whether that patient on that day is qualified to do so. Suppose, for example, that a patient turns 65 halfway through a 30-day hospital stay. HHS will then count only 15 days of his stay when computing the Medicare fraction. Or suppose, similarly, that midway through his stay, a patient begins to qualify as disabled—because, under the statutory definition, he has reached his 25th month of federal disability benefits. Then, too, only the second half of the patient's stay would go into the fraction— because only then has he met the criteria for benefits.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,62,"Empire complains that the phrase (for such days), viewed in that way, does too little work. Brief for Respondent 38, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40-41. But it does more than enough. Some 10,000 people turn 65 in this  country every day, thus qualifying for Medicare coverage. See American Assn. of Retired Persons, The Aging Readiness & Competitiveness Report: United States 2, https://arc.aarpinternational.org/FileLibrary/FullReports/ARC-Report---United-States.pdf. Many other individuals daily attain their 25th month on federal disability benefits. It is natural for Congress to have thought of those facts when devising the fractions. By the way, said Congress (in what truly is an aside or afterthought): If someone turns 65 during the year the fraction covers, make sure to exclude his pre-birthday hospital days. Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1498-1499 (internal quotation marks omitted). Only count the days after he qualifies for Medicare Part A—when, under the statute's constant meaning, he is entitled to Part A benefits.4",Kagan,0,
2021-027,64,"The structure of the relevant statutory provisions reinforces our conclusion that entitled to Part A benefits means qualifying for those benefits, and nothing more. As earlier explained, the statute is designed to recompense hospitals for serving low-income patients, who are comparatively more expensive to treat. See supra, at 2359. The statute determines the appropriate payment (if any) by measuring, through two separate fractions, two separate populations: the low-income Medicare population and the low-income non-Medicare population. See supra, at 2359.5 (Because the vast majority of Medicare patients are over 65, that roughly translates into the low-income senior population and the low-income non-senior population.) Those populations, taken together, account for all the low-income patients a hospital treats.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,65,"HHS's reading of entitled comports with the statute's two-population structure. A low-income Medicare patient always counts in the Medicare fraction. That is so regardless of whether the Medicare program is actually paying for a day of his care—because that fact has no relationship to his financial status. The Medicare fraction, as calculated by HHS, thus captures the entire low-income Medicare (i.e., senior) population. And correlatively, the Medicaid fraction captures the entire low-income non-Medicare (i.e., non-senior) population. The binary dividing line HHS uses—do you qualify for Medicare?—mirrors the statute's binary, population-focused  framework. All low-income people fit naturally into one or the other box, with the sum of the two leaving no one out.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,66,"By contrast, Empire's view fits poorly with the bifurcated, population-based statutory structure. Again, its who-paid-for-a-day-of-care test has no relationship to a patient's financial status. So on Empire's view, a patient could phase in and out of the Medicare fraction even though his income remains the same. Empire responds by asserting that any low-income person excluded from the Medicare fraction (say, because of exhaustion of benefits) would get counted instead in the Medicaid fraction. See Brief for Respondent 15-16, 50-51. But even if that is true—we express our doubts below—Empire's scheme would result in patients ping-ponging back and forth between the two fractions based on the happenstance of actual Medicare payments, sometimes during a single hospital stay. That scheme is of course harder to administer than HHS's. And still more, it does not reflect the statute's dichotomy between two discrete low-income populations, each of which counts (but counts differently) toward setting a hospital's DSH rate. See supra, at 2360, n. 1, 2366, n. 5.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,67,"In any event, Empire is too quick to claim that those who (on its view) are tossed from the Medicare fraction for non-income-based reasons would still wind up in the Medicaid fraction. Recall here the role Empire says the phrase (for such days) plays. See supra, at 2364-2366. According to Empire's ultimate argument, that phrase is what converts the ordinary statutory meaning of entitled to benefits (i.e., qualifying for Medicare) to a special meaning (i.e., actually receiving payments). So where the phrase (for such days) does not appear, the usual meaning of entitled should govern. Now look again at the description of the Medicaid fraction. It counts patients i who (for such days) were eligible for Medicaid, but ii who were not entitled to benefits under part A of Medicare. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(II). In that description, for such days does not modify clause ii. So the not entitled phrase in that clause should mean (consistent with the rest of the statute) not qualifying for Medicare. But those whom Empire's view would oust from the Medicare fraction—say, because of exhaustion—do qualify for Medicare. They thus fall out-side clause ii—and outside the Medicaid fraction. The upshot is that, under Empire's reading, a low-income patient who, say, has exhausted his coverage will not get counted at all. But that person remains just as low income as he ever was, imposing just as high costs on the hospital treating him. His exclusion demonstrates, if anything more needs to, the error of Empire's reading.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,68,"Empire's only response is to insist that its interpretation has to be right because it usually (though not always) leads to higher DSH payments for hospitals. See Brief for Respondent 33-35, supra, at 2361. But the point of the DSH provisions is not to pay hospitals the most money possible, it is instead to compensate hospitals for serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients. And Empire's reading excels only by the former measure, not by the latter one. As just shown, Empire's actual-payment test counts fewer, not more, of the low-income patients the DSH provisions care about. The reason that approach still benefits many hospitals is that it deflates the denominator of the Medicare fraction. Consider a wealthy 70-year-old patient who has exhausted Medicare benefits—or, as is often true, has a private insurance policy. HHS's view would exclude him from the Medicare fraction's numerator (because he is wealthy) but keep him in the denominator (because he is over 65). By contrast, Empire's view would exclude  him from both the numerator and the denominator —the latter because he is not actually receiving Medicare payments. That move increases payments to hospitals —but only because it fails to capture high-income Medicare patients, not because it better captures low-income ones. Or said otherwise, it increases payments because it distorts what the Medicare fraction is designed to measure—the share of low-income Medicare patients relative to the total.",Kagan,0,
2021-027,70,"Text, context, and structure all support calculating the Medicare fraction HHS's way. In that fraction, individuals entitled to Medicare Part A benefits are all those qualifying for the program, regardless of whether they are receiving Medicare payments for part or all of a hospital stay. That reading gives the entitled phrase the same meaning it has throughout the Medicare statute. And it best implements the statute's bifurcated framework by capturing low-income individuals in each of two distinct populations a hospital serves.",Kagan,0,

2021-027,74,"Under the Medicare statute, HHS pays higher reimbursements to hospitals that serve a significant number of low-income patients. The statutory formula for determining exactly how much HHS will pay to those hospitals is mind-numbingly complex. But embedded within the complicated overall formula are various subsidiary calculations, some of which are relatively straightforward.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,75,"This case concerns one of those straightforward subsidiary calculations. Consistent with traditional insurance and coordination-of-benefits principles, Medicare by statute cannot pay for a patient's hospital care if, for example, the patient is covered by private insurance, the patient has exhausted her Medicare benefits, or a third-party tortfeasor is liable for the patient's care. The retrospective reimbursement question raised by the statutory provision in this case is this: Was a patient entitled to have payment made by Medicare for a particular day in the hospital if the patient by statute could not (and did not) have payment made by Medicare for that day? In my view, the answer to that narrow question is straightforward and commonsensical: No.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,76,"Importantly, from the time the statute was enacted in 1986 until 2003, HHS interpreted this statutory provision in the exact same way that I do. See 51 Fed. Reg. 31460-31461 (1986), Brief for Petitioner 32-33. Then in 2004, HHS abruptly changed course. Why? Presumably to save money. HHS was trying hard to find ways to contain Medicare costs in light of increasing Medicare expenditures and the country's fiscal situation. To that end, HHS's new 2004 interpretation of this statutory provision had the downstream effect of significantly reducing HHS's reimbursements to hospitals that serve low-income patients.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,77,"Whatever HHS's precise motivations for the 2004 change, we now must focus on the statutory text and HHS's current interpretation of it. To begin, both parties offer a dog's breakfast of arguments about broad statutory purposes, real-world effects, surplusage, structure, consistent usage, inconsistent usage, agency deference, and the like. But this case is resolved by the most  fundamental principle of statutory interpretation: Read the statute.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,78,"The relevant text of this reimbursement provision refers to the number of  patient days  which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A. 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). Importantly, the statute elsewhere says that the benefits provided under Medicare Part A consist of a patient's entitlement to have payment made on his behalf  (subject to the provisions of this part). § 1395d(a) (emphasis added), see also § 426(c) (entitlement means entitlement to have payment made under, and subject to the limitations in, part A (emphasis added)).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,79,"Zero in on the phrases entitlement to have payment made and for such days. In my view (and in HHS's view from 1986 to 2003), a patient was entitled to have payment made by Medicare for particular days in the hospital if Medicare was obligated to pay for the patient's care for those days. Stated the other way, a patient was not entitled to have payment made by Medicare for particular days in the hospital if the patient by statute could not (and did not) have payment made by Medicare for those days—for example, because the patient had other insurance, the patient had exhausted his Medicare benefits, or a third-party tortfeasor was paying. Simple enough.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,80,"To be sure, patients who satisfy certain criteria (for example, those who are age 65 or older) are generally entitled to Medicare hospitalization benefits. No one disputes that point.

2021-027,82,"The Court concludes otherwise, mainly by (i) saying that entitled to benefits is a term of art in the Medicare statute, (ii) diminishing the value of the statutory phrase (for such days), in part because the phrase appears in a parenthetical, and (iii) invoking a parade of horribles about what could happen to other provisions of the Medicare statute if the Court were to read this provision as I would.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,83,"With respect, none of that adds up. First, although the Medicare statute generally uses entitled to refer to those who meet the basic statutory criteria for Medicare benefits, the retrospective reimbursement provision at issue here focuses laser-like on whether the patient was actually entitled to have payment made by Medicare for particular days in the hospital. A patient cannot be simultaneously entitled and disentitled to have payment made by Medicare for a particular day in the hospital.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-027,84,"Second, contrary to the Court's suggestion, we cannot brush aside the statutory phrase (for such days) simply because that phrase appears in a parenthetical. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). Parentheticals can be important, as the Constitution itself makes clear. See, e.g., Art.

2021-027,85,"Third, properly interpreting this specific reimbursement provision will not make a hash of other provisions or render the Medicare statute unworkable. Ante, at 2363-2364. We need not speculate about that point: For nearly two decades from the time that the statute was enacted in 1986 through 2003, HHS interpreted this reimbursement provision in the same way that I do. And HHS did so without any noted problems for other provisions in the Medicare statute.",Kavanaugh,0,

Both statutory text and common sense point to that conclusion. HHS's contrary interpretation boils down to the proposition that a patient can be simultaneously entitled and disentitled to have payment made by Medicare for a particular day in the hospital. That interpretation does not work. And HHS's misreading of the statute has significant real-world effects: It financially harms hospitals that serve low-income patients, thereby hamstringing those hospitals' ability to provide needed care to low-income communities.",Kavanaugh,0,

Meanwhile, § 924(c) authorizes further punishments for those who use a firearm in connection with a crime of violence.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,30,"For purposes of § 924(c), a federal felony qualifies as a crime of violence if it meets either of two definitions. The first definition is found in § 924(c)(3)(A), a provision sometimes called the elements clause. That clause covers offenses that have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another. The second definition, located next door in § 924(c)(3)(B) and often referred to as the residual clause, encompasses offenses that by their nature, involve a substantial risk that physical force  may be used.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,31,"Before the District Court, the government argued that Mr. Taylor's Hobbs Act offense qualified as a crime of violence under these definitions. And at that point, Mr. Taylor did not disagree, choosing instead to plead guilty to one count each of violating the Hobbs Act and § 924(c). For his crimes, the District Court sentenced Mr. Taylor to 30 years in federal prison—a decade more than he could have received for his Hobbs Act conviction alone.",Gorsuch,0,

By this chain of logic, the government reasoned, Mr. Taylor's § 924(c) conviction and sentence remained sound.",Gorsuch,0,

It held that attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence under § 924(c)(3)(A) because no element of the offense requires the government to prove that the defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use force. By way of remedy, the Court of Appeals vacated Mr. Taylor's § 924(c) conviction and remanded the case for resentencing in light of his sole remaining Hobbs Act conviction.

2021-029,36,"The parties may not see eye to eye on the outcome of this case, but they at least agree on how we should go about deciding it. To determine whether a federal felony may serve as a predicate for a conviction and sentence under the elements clause, they say, we must apply a categorical approach. We must because the clause poses the question whether the federal felony at issue has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. § 924(c)(3)(A) (emphasis added). And answering that question does not require—in fact, it precludes—an inquiry into how any particular defendant may commit the crime. The only relevant question is whether the federal felony at issue always requires the government to prove—beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case—the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force. This Court has long understood similarly worded statutes to demand similarly categorical inquiries. See, e.g., Borden v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1817, 210 L.Ed.2d 63 (2021), Davis, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at ___, Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 7, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,37,"What are the elements the government must prove to secure a conviction for attempted Hobbs Act robbery? Here again the parties share common ground. Under the portion of the Hobbs Act relevant here, to win a conviction for a completed robbery the government must show that the defendant engaged in the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person  of another, against his will, by means of actual or threatened force. § 1951(b). From this, it follows that to win a case for attempted Hobbs Act robbery the government must prove two things: (1) The defendant intended to unlawfully take or obtain personal property by means of actual or threatened force, and (2) he completed a substantial step toward that end. See, e.g., United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 107, 127 S.Ct. 782, 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007). What exactly constitutes a substantial step is beyond the scope of today's case. For present purposes, it is sufficient to observe that the parties again agree. They accept that a substantial step demands something more than mere preparation. Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 402, 25 S.Ct. 276, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905). The step, they say, must be unequivocal, Reply Brief 3, and significant, though it need not be violent, Brief for United States 22.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,38,"To know that much is enough to resolve this case. Whatever one might say about completed Hobbs Act robbery, attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not satisfy the elements clause. Yes, to secure a conviction the government must show an intention to take property by force or threat, along with a substantial step toward achieving that object. But an intention is just that, no more. And whatever a substantial step requires, it does not require the government to prove that the defendant used, attempted to use, or even threatened to use force against another person or his property. As the Model Penal Code explains with respect to the Hobbs Act's common-law robbery analogue, there will be cases, appropriately reached by a charge of attempted robbery, where the actor does not actually harm anyone or even threaten harm. ALI, Model Penal Code § 222.1, p. 114 (1980). If, for example, the defendant is apprehended  before he reaches his robbery victim and thus before he has actually engaged in threatening conduct, proof of his purpose to engage in such conduct can justify a conviction of attempted robbery so long as his intention and some other substantial step are present.

2021-029,39,"A hypothetical helps illustrate the point. Suppose Adam tells a friend that he is planning to rob a particular store on a particular date. He then sets about researching the business's security measures, layout, and the time of day when its cash registers are at their fullest. He buys a ski mask, plots his escape route, and recruits his brother to drive the getaway car. Finally, he drafts a note—Your money or your life—that he plans to pass to the cashier. The note is a bluff, but Adam hopes its implication that he is armed and dangerous will elicit a compliant response. When the day finally comes and Adam crosses the threshold into the store, the police immediately arrest him. It turns out Adam's friend tipped them off.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,40,"There is little question the government could win a lawful conviction against Adam for attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After all, he intended to take property against the cashier's will by threat of force, and his actions constituted a substantial step toward that goal. At the same time, this example helps show why attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence under the elements clause. Adam did not use physical force. He did not attempt to use such force—his note was a bluff and never delivered. And he never even got to the point of threatening the use of force against anyone or anything. He may have intended and attempted to do just that, but he failed. Simply put, no element of attempted Hobbs Act robbery requires proof that the defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use force.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,41,"The upshot of all this for our case is clear. Mr. Taylor may be lawfully subject to up to 20 years in federal prison for his Hobbs Act conviction.

2021-029,44,"Resisting this conclusion, the government offers three principal replies. We take up first the argument the government presented before the Fourth Circuit and on which it prevailed in other circuits. See, e.g., United States v. St. Hubert, 909 F.3d 335, 352-353 (C.A.11 2018). This theory proceeds in the form of a syllogism. The government submits that the elements clause encompasses not only any offense that qualifies as a crime of violence but also any attempt to commit such a crime. And, the government reasons, because completed Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a crime of violence, it follows that attempted Hobbs Act robbery does too.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,45,"While the government pressed this argument in the courts of appeals, it affords it only a passing nod here. And the reason  why quickly becomes clear: The government's syllogism rests on a false premise. The elements clause does not ask whether the defendant committed a crime of violence or attempted to commit one. It asks whether the defendant did commit a crime of violence—and it proceeds to define a crime of violence as a felony that includes as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force. If Congress had wanted the elements clause to do the kind of work the government supposes, it could have easily said so. For example, it might have swept in those federal crimes that require as an element the use or threatened use of force and those that constitute an attempt to commit an offense that has such an element. But that simply is not the law we have.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,47,"Recognizing the weakness of the argument it pressed below, the government spends much of its time before us elaborating two new theories. In the first, the government asks us to focus on the substantial step element of attempted Hobbs Act robbery. That element, the government submits, categorically requires it to prove that a defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use physical force.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,48,"This theory fails too, and for reasons we have already seen. Without question, many who commit the crime of attempted Hobbs Act robbery do use, attempt to use, or threaten to use force. Suppose, for example, that the police had arrested Adam after he handed over his threatening note to the cashier but before he received any money. In a case like that, the defendant would have threatened the use of force while committing an attempted Hobbs Act robbery. But some cases are not all cases, and the government's problem is that no element of attempted Hobbs Act robbery requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used, attempted to use, or even threatened to use force. Individuals like our foiled robber who are arrested before they can threaten anyone may be convicted too. See supra, at 2020-2022, cf. Model Penal Code, at 114-115.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,49,"Seeking a way around this problem, the government responds that we (and presumably the drafters of the Model Penal Code) misconstrue what qualifies as the threatened use of force. On its view, anyone who takes a substantial step toward completing Hobbs Act robbery (say, by buying a weapon, plotting his heist and getaway, writing an extortive note before he leaves home, and entering a store) objectively poses a threatened use of force even if he never communicates his threat to anyone.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,50,"This reply bears its own problems. To start, in the criminal law the word threat and its cognates usually denote a communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm on any person or on property.2 Of course, threats can be communicated verbally or nonverbally—pointing a gun at a cashier conveys a threat no less effectively than passing a note reading your money or your life. But one way or another,  some form of communication is usually required. Even the government concedes that the words threatened force in the Hobbs Act require proof that the defendant communicated a threat to a second person, whether or not that individual is the target of the threat. See Reply Brief 15.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,51,"That leaves the government to suggest that § 924(c)(3)(A) differs from the Hobbs Act and represents an exception to the usual rule. Seeking to make that case, the government observes that, in some contexts, the word threat can be used to speak of a more objective or abstract risk. So, for example, a critic might say that a prison board's decision to parole a particular felon threatens community safety. Or a conservationist might argue that a government decision allowing commercial activity near a national park threatens wildlife habitat. Before us, the government submits that the elements clause uses the term in a similar way, requiring only an objective, if uncommunicated, threat to community peace and order. And, the government argues, anyone who takes a substantial step toward completing a Hobbs Act robbery always or categorically poses such a threat.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,52,"The trouble is, when Congress uses the word threat in this abstract and predictive (rather than communicative) sense, it usually makes its point plain. It may ask, for example, whether an individual or circumstance poses or represents a threat. See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. § 1170(a)(1) (discussing individuals who may pose a threat to transportation security), 8 U.S.C. § 1735(a) (immigration officials must determine that an alien does not pose a threat to the safety or national security of the United States). Here we have nothing like that. In fact, what textual clues we do have point in the opposite direction.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,53,"Take this one. The statute speaks of the use or attempted use of physical force against the person or property of another. Plainly, this language requires the government to prove that the defendant took specific actions against specific persons or their property. Reading the statute's remaining reference to the threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another as requiring a communicated threat fits with this design. By contrast, the government's competing interpretation would vastly expand the statute's reach by sweeping in conduct that poses an abstract risk to community peace and order, whether known or unknown to anyone at the time. It's a reading that would defy our usual rule of statutory interpretation that a law's terms are best understood by the company they keep. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,54,"Beyond that clue lies another. Next door to the elements clause Congress included the residual clause. Under its terms, crimes of violence were defined to embrace offenses that, by their nature, involve a substantial risk that physical force  may be used against a person or property. § 924(c)(3)(B). Pretty plainly, that language called for an abstract inquiry into whether a particular crime, by its nature, poses or presents a substantial risk (or threat) of force being used. See Davis, 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at ___ - ___. Of course, this Court eventually held the residual clause to be unconstitutionally vague. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at ___. But if the government's view of the elements clause caught on, it would only wind up effectively replicating the work formerly performed by the residual clause, collapsing the distinction between them, and perhaps inviting similar constitutional questions along the way. It's an  outcome that would (again) defy our usual rules of statutory interpretation—this time because we do not lightly assume Congress adopts two separate clauses in the same law to perform the same work. See, e.g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 839, n. 14, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,56,"Heaping alternative upon alternative, the government's final theory accepts that a conviction under the elements clause requires a communicated threat of force. But, the argument goes, most attempted Hobbs Act robbery prosecutions involve exactly that. Indeed, the government faults Mr. Taylor for failing to identify a single case in which it has prosecuted someone for attempted Hobbs Act robbery without proving a communicated threat.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,57,"But what does that prove? Put aside the fact that Mr. Taylor has identified cases in which the government has apparently convicted individuals for attempted Hobbs Act robbery without proving a communicated threat. See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 531 Fed.Appx. 270, 271-272 (C.A.3 2013). Put aside the oddity of placing a burden on the defendant to present empirical evidence about the government's own prosecutorial habits. Put aside, too, the practical challenges such a burden would present in a world where most cases end in plea agreements, and not all of those cases make their way into easily accessible commercial databases. See J. Turner, Transparency in Plea Bargaining, 96 Notre Dame L. Rev. 973, 974, 978-981 (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,58,"An even more fundamental and by now familiar problem lurks here. The government's theory cannot be squared with the statute's terms. To determine whether a federal felony qualifies as a crime of violence, § 924(c)(3)(A) doesn't ask whether the crime is sometimes or even usually associated with communicated threats of force (or, for that matter, with the actual or attempted use of force). It asks whether the government must prove, as an element of its case, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,59,"Maybe that is the test the statute presupposes, the government answers, but this Court's case law requires its proposed empirical study all the same. Notice, though, the move implicit here. After previously admitting that we must employ a categorical approach when interpreting the reach of § 924(c)(3)(A), the government effectively backtracks. Instead of looking to the elements of attempted Hobbs Act robbery, the government now says that a defendant must present evidence about how his crime of conviction is normally committed or usually prosecuted. If this admittedly atextual theory seems doubtful on its face, a close look at the case the government invokes does not improve the picture.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,60,"The government points to Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). There, this Court sought to apply provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Id., at 185, 127 S.Ct. 815. Under the INA, an individual with a prior state-court conviction that meets certain generic offense definitions under federal law may face deportation. Id., at 186, 189, 127 S.Ct. 815, see also 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(G), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). In Duenas-Alvarez, there was no doubt that the relevant state offense overlapped significantly with the federal definition of generic theft. 549 U.S., at 190, 127 S.Ct. 815. But, Mr. Duenas-Alvarez argued, state courts had interpreted the offense broadly to reach aiding and abetting conduct that fell beyond generic theft. Id., at 190-191, 127 S.Ct. 815. To test this assertion, the Court looked to  state decisional law and asked whether a realistic probability existed that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the federal generic definition. Id., at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,61,"None of this begins to help the government for at least two reasons. First, the immigration statute at issue in Duenas-Alvarez required a federal court to make a judgment about the meaning of a state statute. Appreciating the respect due state courts as the final arbiters of state law in our federal system, this Court reasoned that it made sense to consult how a state court would interpret its own State's laws. Cf. Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 709, n. 8, 105 S.Ct. 2914, 86 L.Ed.2d 557 (1985). Meanwhile, no such federalism concern is in play here. The statute before us asks only whether the elements of one federal law align with those prescribed in another. Second, in Duenas-Alvarez the elements of the relevant state and federal offenses clearly overlapped and the only question the Court faced was whether state courts also applied the statute in a special (non-generic) manner. 549 U.S., at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815. Here, we do not reach that question because there is no overlap to begin with. Attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not require proof of any of the elements § 924(c)(3)(A) demands. That ends the inquiry, and nothing in Duenas-Alvarezsuggests otherwise.3*",Gorsuch,0,
2021-029,62,"The government quickly abandons the legal theory it advanced in the courts of appeals—and neither of the two new options it auditions before us begins to fill the void. In § 924(c)(3)(A), Congress did not condition long prison terms on an abstract judicial inquiry into whether and to what degree this or that crime poses a risk to community peace and safety. Nor did it mandate an empirical inquiry into how crimes are usually committed, let alone impose a burden on the defendant to present proof about the government's own prosecutorial habits.",Gorsuch,0,

Taylor made that concession because threatening to shoot someone during a robbery is undoubtedly a violent act.

Most relevant here, they charged him with violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which punishes anyone who uses or carries a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence, or who possesses a firearm in furtherance of any such crime. Congress defined a crime of violence in one of two ways: as an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another (commonly called the elements clause), or as an offense that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense (commonly called the residual clause). §§ 924(c)(3)(A), (B).",Thomas,0,

United States, 576 U.S. 591, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), the Court struck down the similarly worded residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), as unconstitutionally vague.

He further argued that attempted Hobbs Act robbery was not a crime of violence under § 924(c)'s elements clause because it lacked as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. § 924(c)(3)(A).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,74,"The Court of Appeals granted the motion to file a successive habeas petition and, in 2020, vacated Taylor's § 924(c) conviction. It did so because, as the Court explains, our precedents require that courts apply a categorical approach when interpreting the elements clause. Ante, at 2024. Under that approach, a criminal defendant who commits a violent crime nonetheless does not commit a crime of violence if a hypothetical criminal could commit the same offense without satisfying § 924(c)'s physical-force requirement. See ibid. Because someone else— Adam—could have committed attempted Hobbs Act robbery without physical force, the Court holds, Taylor's armed robbery that resulted in the victim's death is not a crime of violence under § 924(c).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,76,We have reached this point of absurdity only because this Court applies a narrow categorical approach to § 924(c)'s elements clause and has nullified the residual clause that would have captured crimes like Taylor's.

2021-029,78,"Our odyssey began in 1990, as the Court wrestled with a different clause found in a different part of § 924: ACCA's sentencing enhancement in § 924(e). Unlike § 924(c), which defines a substantive crime, ACCA imposes a sentencing enhancement that applies to any defendant with three or more prior violent felonies whom the Federal Government convicts of illegally possessing a firearm. §§ 922(g), 924(e)(2). Like § 924(c), ACCA defines violent felony with an elements clause and a residual clause. The Act also includes an enumerated-offenses clause defining violent felony to include any crime that is burglary, arson, or extortion, or involves use of explosives. § 924(e)(2).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,79,"In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Court first adopted a categorical approach when interpreting burglary under  ACCA's enumerated-offenses clause. Id., at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Court construed burglary in the abstract, as a generic burglary with elements derived from a treatise and the Model Penal Code. Id., at 593-598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, and n. 8. The Court then held that the enumerated-offenses clause prohibits courts from looking to the particular facts of a defendant's burglary to see if the conduct satisfies the elements of generic burglary. Id., at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. It does not matter how violent the defendant's actual conduct was. Instead, courts must determine whether the elements of the burglary statute under which a defendant was convicted substantially correspond to generic burglary. Id., at 600, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Though Taylor gave few reasons why this so-called categorical approach was the correct reading of ACCA, at the `heart of the decision' were worries that a conduct-based approach to a sentencing enhancement might violate the Sixth Amendment by leading to full-blown mini-trials, with factfinding by the judge instead of the jury. Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct. 1204, 1253, 200 L.Ed.2d 549 (2018) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,80,"While Taylor applied the categorical approach only to ACCA's enumerated-offenses clause, the approach soon migrated to the elements clauses in ACCA and elsewhere. See, e.g., Borden v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1817, 210 L.Ed.2d 63 (2021) (plurality opinion). In that context, the categorical approach demands that a court divine what constitutes the least serious conduct the prior conviction or predicate offense covers and decide whether that conduct falls within the elements clause. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1827. To do that, a judge must mull through any number of hypothetical ways to commit a crime that have nothing to do with the facts of the prior conviction or the facts underlying a predicate § 924(c) offense. United States v. Burris, 912 F.3d 386, 409 (C.A.6 2019) (Thapar, J., concurring). If a court identifies a way to commit the crime without using, attempting to use, or threatening to use force, then the crime is not a violent felony or crime of violence under ACCA's or § 924(c)'s elements clauses. See Borden, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1832.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,81,"This Court eventually extended the categorical approach to ACCA's residual clause as well. In James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), the Court, at the urging of both parties, employed the `categorical approach' to analyze ACCA's residual clause. Id., at 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (quoting Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). That clause defines a violent felony as one that otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). James explained that ACCA's residual-clause categorical approach boiled down to two steps. First, a court looked to the elements of the crime for which the defendant was convicted and asked what conduct the ordinary case of that crime entailed. 550 U.S., at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586. Second, the court asked whether that ordinary case presented a serious potential risk of injury to another comparable to that posed by the specific crimes listed in the enumerated-offenses clause. Id., at 204, 208-209, 127 S.Ct. 1586. If it did, then the predicate crime was a violent felony.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,82,"That test proved difficult to apply. In particular, the Court struggled with how to define the ordinary case of a given predicate crime. See Johnson, 576 U.S., at 597, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (How does one go about deciding what kind of conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves? A statistical analysis of the state reporter? A survey? Expert  evidence? Google? Gut instinct? (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court likewise struggled in assessing what level of risk the ordinary case presented. Id., at 598, 135 S.Ct. 2551. After trying to apply this approach several times, see, e.g., Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the Court in Johnson ultimately abandoned the project. But rather than reassess whether it had adopted the right analytical framework in light of ACCA's text and statutory context, the Court in Johnson nullified ACCA's residual clause altogether. See 576 U.S., at 624, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). According to the Court, the two features of the residual-clause analysis that the Court set out in James—identifying ordinary case conduct and judging whether that abstracted conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury—conspired to make the residual clause unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.S., at 597-598, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (majority opinion).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,83,"That conclusion was not inevitable. The Johnson Court did not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as `substantial risk' to real-world conduct. Id., at 603-604, 135 S.Ct. 2551. Thus, the Court all but conceded that the residual clause would be constitutional if, rather than incorporating James' categorical approach, it looked to whether the `real-world conduct' of the underlying conviction presented a serious risk of physical injury to another. 576 U.S. at 632, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (ALITO, J., dissenting).",Thomas,0,

Id., at ___ - ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. at ___ - ___, ___ - ___. Four of us, however, advanced a more sensible approach: Rather than extend Johnson to nullify § 924(c)'s residual clause, we should simply not use the categorical approach when interpreting residual clauses and adopt a framework focused on the defendant's actual conduct that Johnson conceded was constitutional.

To begin with, the plain text of the residual clause strongly supports a conduct-based approach. See ibid. Further, none of the perceived Sixth Amendment concerns that attend to ACCA's sentencing enhancement are present in the § 924(c) context, because a jury will find the facts or, if the case ends in a guilty plea, the defendant will accept the facts in the plea agreement. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2345. Finally, if any ambiguity remains, a conduct-based approach to § 924(c)'s residual clause best accords with the canon counseling courts to construe statutes not to violate the Constitution whenever possible.

This is a case of avoiding actual unconstitutionality), see also Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at ___(THOMAS, J., dissenting).

The categorical approach, meanwhile, forecloses § 924(c)'s elements clause unless, in every hypothetical prosecution, the crime of conviction requires the Government to prove that physical force against another was used, attempted, or threatened.

Walker and an accomplice had kicked in the door of a family's home, held the victims at gunpoint, beat some of them, demanded money, and threatened to kill the family's 4-year-old daughter, all before locking the family in a closet and ransacking the house. Factual Basis for Guilty Plea in United States v. Walker, 934 F.3d 375 (2014). No one could dispute that Walker's conduct presented a substantial risk that physical force would be used in the course of committing the offense. § 924(c)(3)(B). Yet, because of Davis, the Fourth Circuit could not invoke the residual clause. See Walker, 934 F.3d at 378. That left only § 924(c)(3)'s elements clause, interpreted according to the inflexible categorical approach. Compelled to imagine whether federal kidnaping could hypothetically be committed without the use of physical force, the Fourth Circuit ultimately vacated Walker's § 924(c) conviction because a criminal could commit the offense by inveigling a victim and then holding him in captivity with a mental restraint.

S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 1024, 212 L.Ed.2d 140 (2022), the First Circuit considered whether a terrorist's conviction for federal arson—which he committed in the course of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings—counted as a crime of violence under § 924(c). Tsarnaev and his brother intentionally detonated bombs that killed three people, including an 8-year-old, and injured hundreds more. See id., at ___-___. Yet, the categorical-approach precedents led the First Circuit to the admittedly counterintuitive conclusion that federal arson resulting in death arising from a terrorist bombing was not a crime of violence. Tsarnaev, 968 F.3d at 102. The residual clause had been nullified,  id., at 99, and the First Circuit held that federal arson did not satisfy the elements clause because it theoretically could have been committed recklessly, id., at 102,2 which, we have held in the ACCA context, renders a crime outside the elements clause, see Borden, 593 U. S., at ___ - ___ (plurality opinion).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,90,"Finally, in United States v. Ledbetter, 929 F.3d 338 (C.A.6 2019), the Sixth Circuit vacated two convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 924(j), which criminalizes causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm in the course of a violation of § 924(c). 929 F.3d at 360-361. The two defendants were associated with a gang called the Short North Posse. Id., at 359. One belonged to a subunit of the gang, appropriately named the `Homicide Squad,' which specialized in murders and robberies. Id., at 345. In August 2007, they joined a team of gang members who broke into a home and shot a victim to death. Id., at 359. Section 924(c)'s residual clause would have covered the defendants' conduct, given that there is obviously a substantial risk that physical force would be used in the course of a gangland home-invasion murder. § 924(c)(3)(B). But Davis had nullified that clause, and the Government conceded that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery—the predicate crime for the defendants' § 924(j) convictions —was not a crime of violence under this Court's elements-clause precedents. 929 F.3d at 360-361. These are not the only homicide-related § 924 convictions that Davis has undermined.3",Thomas,0,
2021-029,91,"These examples show how our precedents have led the Federal Judiciary to a pretend place. United States v. Davis, 875 F.3d 592, 595 (C.A.11 2017). With the residual clause nullified, courts cannot look to it to capture violent crimes. And, because of the categorical approach, the elements clause often does not apply because other defendants at other times may have been convicted, or future defendants could be convicted, of violating the same statute without violence. Ibid. Like Alice, we have strayed far down the rabbit hole, and curiouser and curiouser it has all become. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,93,"There is a straightforward solution to this problem—overrule Davis. Cf. Borden, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1835 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (There is a straightforward solution to this dilemma— overrule Johnson). It is a demonstrably erroneous precedent that veered from the best interpretation of § 924(c)'s residual clause. See supra, at ___ - ___ (citing Davis, 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at ___ - ___ (KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting)), cf. Johnson, 576 U.S., at 613, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (noting this Court's habit of wielding due process doctrines like vagueness to achieve its own policy goals). Accordingly, I would overrule Davis and adopt in its place the conduct-based approach that the Davis dissent described. Overruling Davis would revive § 924(c)'s  residual clause, once again allowing the statute to capture the vast majority of § 924(c) convictions that elude an elements clause straightjacketed by the categorical approach.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,94,"With a revived residual clause, resolving this case is easy. Taylor's counsel acknowledged that Congress enacted the residual clause to capture cases just like Taylor's. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48-49. His confessed conduct —an attempted armed robbery during which the victim was shot and killed—by its nature, involved a substantial risk that physical force would be used. § 924(c)(3)(B). Thus, Taylor committed a predicate offense that supported his § 924(c) conviction. Taylor's appeal should therefore fail, and he should serve the 10 years in prison he received for the § 924(c) conviction.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,95,"This same logic would have saved the other convictions described above. Equipped with a revived residual clause focused on the defendant's actual conduct, those federal courts would not have had to vacate the § 924(c) convictions of kidnapers who threatened families, terrorists who bombed sporting events, or murderers who shot their victims. In other words, those courts could have applied the statute that Congress enacted rather than the one this Court effectively rewrote and then nullified.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,97,"The costs of our decisions imposing the categorical approach on § 924(c) and other statutes have been immense. Apart from the unnatural results it produces in § 924(c) cases, the categorical approach has led to equally baffling ones in the ACCA context and elsewhere. See, e.g., Burris, 912 F.3d at 407 (Thapar, J., concurring) (A casual reader  might struggle to understand why we are even debating if ramming a vehicle into a police officer is a crime of violence), Davis, 875 F.3d at 604 (holding that a man charged with first-degree rape who pleaded to first-degree sexual abuse by forcible compulsion had not committed an ACCA violent felony because the force required was insufficiently violent). Moreover, courts attempting to apply the categorical approach waste time thinking up improbable hypotheticals, making the approach very difficult to administer. Burris, 912 F.3d at 407 (Thapar, J., concurring), see also, e.g., Cradler v. United States, 891 F.3d 659, 672 (C.A.6 2018) (Kethledge, J., concurring) (Whatever the merits of this approach, accuracy and judicial efficiency are not among them). Finally, Congress, through legislation, created crimes like § 924(c) and enhancements like ACCA to reduce gun crime rates by imposing long sentences on violent criminals who use firearms. See Davis, 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at ___ - ___ (KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting). Yet, as a growing chorus of Court of Appeals judges has explained, the categorical approach stymies that effort. See, e.g., United States v. Ovalles, 905 F.3d 1231, 1253-1257 (C.A.11 2018) (W. Pryor, J., concurring). No rational legislature would have implicitly imposed this byzantine and resource-depleting legal doctrine that so encumbers federal courts and threatens public safety.",Thomas,0,
2021-029,98,"Worse still, this Court has imposed these costs on the federal courts and the public even though the text of these provisions does not demand them. I have already pointed out the absurdity of applying the categorical approach to the enumerated-offenses clause of ACCA and have suggested that a conduct-based approach better fits the text. Quarles v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. 1872, 1880, 204 L.Ed.2d 200 (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring). And although the categorical approach  might be a linguistically possible interpretation of the residual clauses, the underlying-conduct approach is the better one. Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1255 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). And finally, while I have suggested that the categorical approach applies most plausibly in the elements-clause context, see id., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at ___, the Government has suggested that even that clause might better accord with a conduct-based approach. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6, see also Burris, 912 F.3d at 409-410 (Thapar, J., concurring).",Thomas,0,
2021-029,99,"In light of the mischief that the categorical approach has caused, we should welcome briefing on whether a conduct-based approach tacks closer to statutory text and common sense—especially in the elements-clause context. If it does, we should adopt it.4* * *",Thomas,0,

2021-029,101,"Justice ALITO, dissenting.",Alito,0,
2021-029,102,"As Justice THOMAS clearly shows, the offense for which respondent Justin Taylor was convicted constituted a violent felony in the ordinary sense of the term. Taylor and an accomplice met with Martin Silvester for the ostensible purpose of selling him marijuana, but unbeknownst to Silvester, Taylor and his accomplice did not intend to complete the sale. Instead, they had agreed to threaten Silvester with a 9-millimeter pistol and demand that he hand over his money. When Silvester refused to comply with their demand, Taylor's accomplice shot Silvester, and he died the next day. Taylor was convicted of using and carrying a firearm during, and in relation to, a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A). That conviction was based on a predicate act of attempted robbery in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).",Alito,0,
2021-029,103,"The Court holds that this violent (and, indeed, deadly) offense did not constitute a crime of violence under the technical definition of that term in § 924(c)(3)(A). I agree with Justice THOMAS that our cases involving § 924(c)(3)(A) have veered off into fantasy land.1 But if the Court is  going to disregard the real world and base its decisions in this area on a strict reading of the text, the offense for which Taylor was convicted—attempted Hobbs Act robbery— meets the definition in § 924(c)(3)(A). That definition provides that an offense qualifies as a `crime of violence' if it is a felony and has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. (Emphasis added.)",Alito,0,
2021-029,104,"The key point is the meaning of an element of an offense. This is a fundamental criminal law concept, and we must therefore presume that § 924(c)(3)(A) employs the term in its usual and established sense. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 320-321 (2012). And the usual and established meaning of an element is clear: It is a `constituent part' of a crime's legal definition—a thing the `prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction.' Mathis v. United States, 579 U.S. 500, 504, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014)). See also, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 477, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 510, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995).",Alito,0,
2021-029,105,"It is also established that there are two different types of elements. Some are invariant, that is, they must be proved in every case. But it is not uncommon for statutes to include a set of alternative elements and to provide that one, but not all, of these alternative elements must be proved to secure a conviction. As the Court said in Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), a statute may set out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative —for example, by stating that burglary involves entry into a building or an automobile. Id., at 257, 133 S.Ct. 2276 (emphasis in original).",Alito,0,
2021-029,106,"The Hobbs Act includes both types of elements. It criminalizes a robbery that obstructs, delays, or affects interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), and it defines robbery to mean the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person  of another, against his will, by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, § 1951(b)(1). Accordingly, the elements of Hobbs Act robbery are (1) the unlawful taking or obtaining (2) of personal property (3) from the person of another (4) against his or her will (5) by means of actual or (6) by means of threatened force, or (7) by means of violence, or (8) by means of fear of injury. The first four elements must be proved in every case, while the last four are alternative elements any one of which is sufficient for conviction.2  A completed Hobbs Act robbery satisfies § 924(c)(3)(A) because multiple elements involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another. Elements (5) thorough (8) obviously qualify, and it is possible that element (4) does as well.",Alito,0,
2021-029,107,"The offense of attempted Hobbs Act robbery also qualifies. A person commits a criminal attempt if he or she takes a `substantial step' toward completing an intended offense. United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 106-107, 127 S.Ct. 782, 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007) (quoting 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 11.4) (2d ed. 2003)). In other words, a defendant must intend to commit some combination of elements that is sufficient to constitute Hobbs Act robbery and must take a substantial step toward the commission of such a combination of elements. If we label these combinations as A, B, C , then the elements of attempted Hobbs Act robbery are (1) intending to commit at least one qualifying combination, i.e., A, B, C , and (2) taking a substantial step toward the commission of A, B, C . Each such combination constitutes an offense within the meaning of § 924(c)(3), and several combinations satisfy the definition of a crime of violence.",Alito,0,
2021-029,108,"Here is a straightforward example: A hypothetical defendant (let's call her Eve) intends to take or obtain personal property from the person of another unlawfully and against his or her will by means of actual force. Eve is guilty of the offense of attempted Hobbs Act robbery, and her offense has as an element the use of physical force against the person of another. That is where the Court must end up if it looks at only the text of § 924(c)(3)(A) and the Hobbs Act.",Alito,0,
2021-029,109,It is no answer to this argument that Taylor is not Eve. He is also not Adam. The whole point of the categorical approach that the Court dutifully follows is that the real world must be scrupulously disregarded.,Alito,0,
2021-029,110,"The Court reaches the opposite conclusion only because it accepts the proposition —which the Government did not contest —that a felony has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force only if the felony always requires the government to prove the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case. Ante, at 2034 (emphasis added), see Brief for Respondent 13-18. In other words, the Court assumes that an offense X has an element A if and only if convicting a defendant of X requires the Government to prove A in every prosecution for offense X. Based on this assumption, the Court infers that attempted Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under § 924(c)(3)(A) because it is possible to commit that offense without attempting to use force.",Alito,0,
2021-029,111,"There is no textual basis for this reading, and I would not adopt an erroneous interpretation that will govern a multitude of cases just because the Government has made an improvident concession in this case. If the Court wants to hold the Government to the position it has taken here, it can dismiss the case and give Taylor the benefit of the judgment in his favor below. But a party's mistaken argument should not be permitted to alter the meaning of the law Congress enacted.",Alito,0,
2021-029,112,"Nothing in our precedent suggests that we should deviate from § 924(c)(3)(A)'s plain text. We have never interpreted § 924(c)(3)(A) to require a version of the categorical approach that would exclude from the elements that an offense has those elements that may be proved as alternatives to one another. The most we have said is that, in applying the categorical approach to other statutory provisions, statutes setting forth disjunctive or alternative elements should be analyzed through what we have called the modified categorical approach. See Descamps, 570 U.S. at 260-264, 133 S.Ct. 2276 (burglary under Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)), Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (same). Under this approach, courts must examine a limited class of documents (for example, the indictment, jury instructions, or plea agreement and colloquy) to determine which alternative element of an offense figured in the crime for which the defendant was convicted. Mathis, 579 U.S. at 505, 136 S.Ct. 2243.",Alito,0,
2021-029,113,"As I have previously explained, the modified categorical approach is difficult to apply, and I would not apply it here. See id., at 536-544, 136 S.Ct. 2243 (dissenting opinion), Descamps, 570 U.S. at 281-296, 133 S.Ct. 2276 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Instead, I would simply hold that because one of the elements of the attempted Hobbs Act robbery is the attempted use of force, that offense falls within § 924(c)(3)(A)'s definition of crime of violence.",Alito,0,
2021-029,114,"But if we were to apply the modified categorical approach in this case, the result would be the same. In his plea agreement and associated statement of facts, Taylor admitted that he and his accomplice intended to lure Silvester into an alleyway, hold him at gunpoint, and take his money by force in the event that he resisted. And Taylor and his accomplice took more than a substantial step toward realizing this plan. After all, they ultimately shot and killed Silvester. So in accepting Taylor's plea, it is plain that the sentencing judge determined that Taylor had intended to commit Hobbs Act robbery by using force and had taken a substantial step toward the accomplishment of that end. That is more than sufficient to show that Taylor's actual crime had as an element the  use of physical force against the person  of another. § 924(c)(3)(A).",Alito,0,
2021-029,115,"For these reasons, I believe that the Court's approach and ultimate holding in this case are misguided. I would hold that Taylor committed a crime of violence within the meaning of § 924(c)(3)(A) and reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit below. But there is a silver lining in the majority opinion. Because the Court assumes—and does not hold—that alternative elements do not qualify as independent elements of a crime for purposes of applying § 924(c)(3)(A), the Government remains free to advance the correct interpretation of that provision in a future case. For my purposes, however, the text of the statute is clear enough to support reversal  here and now. As a result, I respectfully dissent.",Alito,0,

Ramirez's merits brief addresses only RLUIPA, however, so we do not consider any standalone argument under the Free Exercise Clause.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,51,"We are also mindful that, while we have had full briefing and oral argument in this Court, the case comes to us in a preliminary posture: The question is whether Ramirez's execution without the requested participation of his pastor should be halted, pending full consideration of his claims on a complete record. The parties agree that the relief sought is properly characterized as a preliminary injunction. Under such circumstances, the party seeking relief must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,53,"The prison officials begin by arguing that Ramirez cannot hope to succeed on his claims, because he failed to exhaust all available remedies before filing suit. Such exhaustion is mandatory under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), even in the execution context. See Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 85, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006), Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 520, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). The Act requires compliance with deadlines and other critical procedural rules, Woodford, 548 U.S., at 90-91, 126 S.Ct. 2378, with no exceptions for special circumstances, Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 635, 136 S.Ct. 1850, 195 L.Ed.2d 117 (2016). Thus, if Ramirez failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies, his suit may not proceed. Respondents argue that is the case here. We disagree.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,54,"The Texas prison grievance process is straightforward. See Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Offender Orientation Handbook 73-75 (Feb. 2017) (Prison Handbook). Prior to filing a grievance, an inmate must try to resolve the issue informally. If that does not work, the prisoner must file a Step 1 grievance within 15 days of the alleged incident or occurrence. Id., at 74. When filing a grievance, an inmate must clearly state the specific action required to resolve the complaint. Id., at 75. Prison officials then have 40 days to decide the grievance. If the prisoner remains dissatisfied, he may appeal by filing a Step 2 grievance within 15 days. Prison officials have another 40 days to issue a decision on the appeal. Id., at 74. Only after exhausting both steps of that grievance process may a prisoner file suit. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,55,"We are persuaded—at least in the current posture of the case—that Ramirez properly exhausted these administrative remedies. The record indicates that Ramirez tried to resolve the issue informally with a prison chaplain. App. 52.1 When that did not work, he filed a Step 1 grievance  requesting that his pastor be allowed to `lay hands on me' & pray over me while I am being executed. Id., at 52-53. Prison officials denied that grievance, and Ramirez timely appealed. Id., at 53, 155-156. His Step 2 grievance reiterated, I wish to have my Spiritual Advisor `lay hands on me' to pray over me during my upcoming execution. Id., at 155. Ramirez's grievances thus clearly stated that he wished to have his pastor touch him and pray with him during his execution. Prison Handbook 75. In the context of Texas's grievance system, that is enough.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,56,"Respondents briefly argue that Ramirez failed to exhaust Texas's grievance process because he filed suit before prison officials ruled on his Step 2 grievance. See Brief for Respondents 28. It is true that prison officials did not decide that grievance until six days after Ramirez sued. Compare App. 1 with id., at 155-156. But Ramirez filed an amended complaint that same day, and he also filed a second amended complaint after that. Id., at 2-3. The original defect was arguably cured by those subsequent filings. See Rhodes v. Robinson, 621 F.3d 1002, 1005 (C.A.9 2010) (As a general rule, when a plaintiff files an amended complaint, the amended complaint supercedes the original, the latter being treated thereafter as non-existent. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)) (PLRA case). In any event, we need not definitively resolve the issue as respondents failed to raise it below. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (we are a court of review, not of first view).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,57,"Respondents also argue that Ramirez failed to properly exhaust his request for audible prayer in the execution chamber. The gist of their argument is that while his grievances clearly requested prayer, they did not clearly request audible prayer. See Brief for Respondents 25-30. We disagree. Ramirez asked that prison officials permit his pastor to lay hands on him and pray over him during the execution. App. 53. While it is true that this language did not explicitly reference audible prayer, the language adequately conveyed such a request for several reasons. First, if Ramirez had merely wanted silent prayer, his grievance need not have mentioned prayer at all. He and his pastor could have prayed silently and no one would have been the wiser. Second, praying aloud is a common type of Christian prayer that people engage in together. See Brief for Petitioner 21-22. Even respondents concede that such prayer is not uncommon. Brief for Respondents 30. Finally, Texas's historic practice of allowing prison chaplains to pray audibly with inmates inside the execution chamber further suggests that Ramirez intended to invoke this practice. See Brief for Petitioner 32-33. A request for audible prayer is thus the most natural understanding of Ramirez's grievances.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,58,"Nor are we persuaded by respondents' argument that Ramirez should have filed his grievance sooner. In Texas, prisoners must raise a grievance within 15 days from the date of the alleged incident or occurrence. Prison Handbook 74. Respondents contend that Ramirez should have filed his grievance within 15 days of when Texas issued its revised execution protocol (April 21, 2021), or within 15 days of when he learned that his pastor would be allowed inside the chamber (May 4, 2021). See Brief for Respondents 26-27. Both suggestions are untenable. Neither the revised execution protocol nor the State's decision to admit Pastor Moore put Ramirez on notice that religious touch and audible prayer would be banned inside the execution chamber. To the contrary, Texas had long permitted such activities. See Brief for Petitioner 29-33, Brief for Former Prison Officials as Amici Curiae 6-11.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,59,"Ramirez says—and respondents do not dispute—that he first learned of the prohibition on religious touch on June 8, 2021. Reply Brief 4.

We thus have little trouble concluding that the grievance was timely, and that we may proceed to the merits.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,61,"Congress enacted RLUIPA, and its sister statute the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., in the aftermath of our decisions in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v.

2021-030,62,"RLUIPA provides that no government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution— including state prisoners—even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). A plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving that a prison policy implicates his religious exercise. Holt, 574 U.S., at 360, 135 S.Ct. 853. Although RLUIPA protects any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief, § 2000cc-5(7)(A), a prisoner's requested accommodation must be sincerely based on a religious belief and not some other motivation, id., at 360-361, 135 S.Ct. 853. The burden on the prisoner's religious exercise must also be substantial. Id., at 361, 135 S.Ct. 853. Once a plaintiff makes such a showing, the burden flips and the government must demonstrate that imposition of the burden on that person is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. § 2000cc-1(a), see also id., at 362, 135 S.Ct. 853. This allocation of respective burdens applies in the preliminary injunction context. Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente Uniño do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429-430, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006).",Roberts,0,

Ramirez seeks to have his pastor lay hands on him and pray over him during the execution. Both are traditional forms of religious exercise. See Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 3-19. As Ramirez's grievance states, it is part of my faith to have my spiritual advisor lay hands on me anytime I am sick or dying. App. 52. Pastor Moore, who has ministered to Ramirez for four years, agrees that prayer accompanied by touch is a significant part of our faith tradition as Baptists. Id., at 47. And neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals doubted that Ramirez had a sincere religious basis for his requested accommodations.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,65,"Respondents' argument to the contrary turns in large part on a complaint Ramirez filed in 2020. See Brief for Respondents 35-37. Ramirez filed the complaint while  Texas's prior execution protocol, which banned all spiritual advisors from the execution chamber, was in place. See App. 56-70, 111. The complaint sought Pastor Moore's presence and prayer in the chamber, but disclaimed any need for touch. Id., at 61 (When Plaintiff Ramirez is executed, Pastor Moore will pray with him. Pastor Moore need not touch Mr. Ramirez at any time in the execution chamber.). As respondents see things, this shows that Ramirez's current request for touch is insincere.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,66,"Ramirez responds that the 2020 complaint was inaccurate, and that he would have amended it had the litigation continued. Brief for Petitioner 11, n. 3, Reply Brief 7, n. 5. The litigation, however, did not proceed, because the parties jointly agreed to dismiss the suit without prejudice less than a week after it was filed. See Notice of Nonsuit Without Prejudice in No. 2:20-cv-205 (SD Tex. 2020). Ramirez's specific statement in his prior complaint is certainly probative on the issue of sincerity, evolving litigation positions may suggest a prisoner's goal is delay rather than sincere religious exercise. See Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 278, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005). Under the facts of this case, however, we do not think the prior complaint—dismissed without prejudice and by agreement one week after it was filed—outweighs the ample evidence that Ramirez's beliefs are sincere. Respondents do not dispute that any burden their policy imposes on Ramirez's religious exercise is substantial. See Holt, 574 U.S., at 361, 135 S.Ct. 853.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,68,"Because Ramirez is likely to succeed in showing that Texas's policy substantially burdens his exercise of religion, respondents must prove that their refusal to accommodate the exercise both (1) furthers a compelling governmental interest, and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). Under RLUIPA, the government cannot discharge this burden by pointing to broadly formulated interests. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 726, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014). It must instead demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law to the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.

2021-030,71,"As for audible prayer, there is a rich history of clerical prayer at the time of a prisoner's execution, dating back well before the founding of our Nation. See Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 3-15. For example, at Newgate Prison—one of London's most notorious jails—an Anglican priest would stand and pray with the condemned in their final moments. A. McKenzie, Tyburn's Martyrs 9-14 (2007). By the early 1700s, that practice had evolved to permit prisoners to be attended by a minister, or even a priest, of their own communion. Id., at 176, see also id., at 176-182. Prayer at the time of execution was also commonplace in the American Colonies. See, e.g., W. Smith, New London Gazette, Sept. 11, 1772, reprinted in W. DeLoss Love, Samsom Occom and the Christian Indians of New England 173-174 (1899) (The Rev. Mr. Occom  attended the Criminal to the Place of Execution, where he made a short but well adapted Prayer to the Occasion.), see also W. Smith, The Convict's Visitor 85 (1791) (containing model prayers for clergy attending to the condemned,  including at the giving of the signal). And during the Revolutionary War, General George Washington ordered that prisoners under sentence of death be attended with such Chaplains, as they choose— including at the time of their execution. G. Washington, General Orders (June 9, 1777), see also ibid. (May 1, 1780). These chaplains often spoke and prayed with the condemned during their final moments. See Pennsylvania Evening Post, June 6, 1780, vol. 4, p. 62, col. 2 (Upon the arrival of the criminals at the place of execution, the attending chaplain  prayed and recommended them severally to God.).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,72,"A tradition of such prayer continued throughout our Nation's history. See S. Banner, The Death Penalty 35-36 (2002). When, for example, the Federal Government executed four members of the conspiracy that led to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the prisoners were accompanied by clergy of various denominations. See End of the Assassins, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1865, p. 1, col. 1. These spiritual advisers ministered to the condemned, and three spoke public prayers shortly before the prisoners were hanged. Id., at col. 5-6. And in the aftermath of World War II, the United States Army even permitted Nazi war criminals facing execution to be accompanied by a chaplain, who spoke prayers on the gallows in the moments before death. See H. Gerecke, I Walked to the Gallows With the Nazi Chiefs, Saturday Evening Post, Sept. 1, 1951, p. 58.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,73,"The practice continues today. In 2020 and 2021, the Federal Bureau of Prisons allowed religious advisors to speak or pray audibly with inmates during at least six federal executions. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-25. What's more, Texas itself appears to have long allowed prison chaplains to pray with inmates in the execution chamber, deciding to prohibit such prayer only in the last several years. Id., at 2-3.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,74,"Despite this long history, prison officials now insist that a categorical ban on audible prayer in the execution chamber is the least restrictive means of furthering two compelling governmental interests.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,75,"First, prison officials say that absolute silence is necessary in the execution chamber so they can monitor the inmate's condition through a microphone suspended overhead. They say that audible prayer might impede their ability to hear subtle signs of trouble or prove distracting during an emergency. See Brief for Respondents 46. We do not doubt that prison officials have a compelling interest in monitoring an execution and responding effectively during any potential emergency. And we recognize that audible prayer could present a more serious risk of interference during the delicate process of lethal injection than during the method of execution (hanging) that was used in most of the historical examples we have cited. But respondents fail to show that a categorical ban on all audible prayer is the least restrictive means of furthering their compelling interests.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,76,"Indeed, respondents offer only a conclusory defense of the policy's tailoring. They acknowledge that both the Federal Government and Alabama have recently permitted audible prayer or speech in the execution chamber, but then assert that, under the circumstances in Texas's chamber, allowing speech during the execution is not feasible. Id., at 47. Respondents do not explain why. Nor do they explore any relevant differences between Texas's execution chamber or process and those of other jurisdictions. Instead, they ask that we simply defer to their determination. That is not enough under RLUIPA. Nor is there a basis for deference, given that Texas has historically and routinely allowed  prison chaplains to audibly pray with the condemned during executions, a fact Texas does not dispute. Brief for Petitioner 29, see also id., at 32-33.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,77,"Second, prison officials say that if they allow spiritual advisors to pray aloud during executions, the opportunity could be exploited to make a statement to the witnesses or officials, rather than the inmate. Brief for Respondents 46. They note that such statements might cause further trauma to the victim's family or otherwise interfere with the execution. Ibid. We agree that the government has a compelling interest in preventing disruptions of any sort and maintaining solemnity and decorum in the execution chamber. But there is no indication in the record that Pastor Moore would cause the sorts of disruptions that respondents fear. Respondents' argument thus comes down to conjecture regarding what a hypothetical spiritual advisor might do in some future case. Such speculation is insufficient to satisfy respondents' burden, see Fulton v. Philadelphia, 593 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1868, 1882, 210 L.Ed.2d 137 (2021), and fails to engage in the sort of case-by-case analysis that RLUIPA requires, see Holt, 574 U.S., at 363, 135 S.Ct. 853.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,78,"What's more, there appear to be less restrictive ways to handle any concerns. Prison officials could impose reasonable restrictions on audible prayer in the execution chamber—such as limiting the volume of any prayer so that medical officials can monitor an inmate's condition, requiring silence during critical points in the execution process (including when an execution warrant is read or officials must communicate with one another), allowing a spiritual advisor to speak only with the inmate, and subjecting advisors to immediate removal for failure to comply with any rule. Prison officials could also require spiritual advisors to sign penalty-backed pledges agreeing to abide by all such limitations.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,79,"Given the current record, respondents have not shown that a total ban on audible prayer is the least restrictive means of furthering their asserted interests.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,81,"Respondents' categorical ban on religious touch in the execution chamber fares no better. They point to three governmental interests they say are compelling: security in the execution chamber, preventing unnecessary suffering, and avoiding further emotional trauma to the victim's family members. All three goals are commendable. But again, respondents fail to show that a categorical ban on touch is the least restrictive means of accomplishing any of them.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,82,"Respondents say that allowing a spiritual advisor to touch an inmate would place the advisor in harm's way because the inmate might escape his restraints, smuggle in a weapon, or become violent. Brief for Respondents 37-38. They also contend that if a spiritual advisor were close enough to touch an inmate, he might tamper with the prisoner's restraints or yank out an IV line. Id., at 38-39. We agree that prisons have compelling interests in both protecting those attending an execution and preventing them from interfering with it (though if an inmate smuggling a weapon into the execution chamber is a serious prospect, the prison has broader issues than those considered here). Even so, Texas's categorical ban on religious touch is not the least restrictive means of furthering such interests.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,83,"Under Texas's current protocol, spiritual advisors stand just three feet from the gurney in the execution chamber. Id., at 38. A security escort is posted nearby, ready to intervene if anything goes awry. Ibid. We do not see how letting the spiritual advisor stand slightly closer, reach out  his arm, and touch a part of the prisoner's body well away from the site of any IV line would meaningfully increase risk. And that is all Ramirez requests here. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9-10 (Ramirez's counsel stating, Pastor Moore can touch Mr. Ramirez's foot, an extremity on the complete far end of the body from the point at which the IV line will be inserted into his arm . That would satisfy the religious exercise.).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,84,"Respondents next argue that allowing the pastor to touch Ramirez in the execution chamber might lead to preventable suffering. The theory is that Pastor Moore might accidentally jostle, pinch, or otherwise interfere with an IV line, and that this in turn might affect the administration of the execution drugs in a way that results in greater pain or suffering. See Brief for Respondents 38-39. We think that preventing accidental interference with the prison's IV lines is a compelling governmental interest. But we also think it is one reasonably addressed by means short of banning all touch in the execution chamber.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,85,"For example, Texas could allow touch on a part of the body away from IV lines, such as a prisoner's lower leg. That seems to have been the practice of many prison chaplains during past Texas executions. Brief for Petitioner 29-33. Additionally, Texas could require Ramirez's pastor to stand in a location that gives the medical team an unobstructed view of the IV lines, allowing them to watch for problems and quickly respond. Texas could also restrict the time period during which touching is permitted to minimize risk during critical points in the execution process, such as the insertion of the IV line. Finally, Texas could require that the pastor undergo training so that he understands the importance of staying away from IV lines and taking whatever other precautions are necessary to avoid problems in the chamber.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,86,"Texas does nothing to rebut these obvious alternatives, instead suggesting that it is Ramirez's burden to identify any less restrictive means. Brief for Respondents 41. That gets things backward. Once a plaintiff has made out his initial case under RLUIPA, it is the government that must show its policy is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a)(2).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,87,"Finally, respondents say that allowing certain forms of religious touch might further traumatize a victim's family members who are present as witnesses, reminding them that their loved one received no such solace. Brief for Respondents 39-40. As we have already noted, maintaining solemnity and decorum in the execution chamber is a compelling governmental interest. But here what is at issue is allowing Pastor Moore to respectfully touch Ramirez's foot or lower leg inside the execution chamber. Respondents do not contend that this particular act will result in trauma. See ibid. Instead, their real concern seems to be with other, potentially more problematic requests down the line. RLUIPA, however, requires that courts take cases one at a time, considering only the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened. Holt, 574 U.S., at 363, 135 S.Ct. 853. As a result, respondents' final argument is unavailing.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,88,We conclude that Ramirez is likely to prevail on his claim that Texas's categorical ban on religious touch in the execution chamber is inconsistent with his rights under RLUIPA.,Roberts,0,
2021-030,91,"Our conclusion that Ramirez is likely to prevail on the merits of his RLUIPA  claims does not end the matter. As noted earlier, he must also show that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. Winter, 555 U.S., at 20, 129 S.Ct. 365.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,92,"We think these factors also favor an injunction. Ramirez is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief because he will be unable to engage in protected religious exercise in the final moments of his life. Compensation paid to his estate would not remedy this harm, which is spiritual rather than pecuniary.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,93,"Additionally, the balance of equities and public interest tilt in Ramirez's favor. Ramirez does not seek an open-ended stay of execution. Brief for Petitioner 44. Rather, he requests a tailored injunction requiring that Texas permit audible prayer and religious touch during his execution. By passing RLUIPA, Congress determined that prisoners like Ramirez have a strong interest in avoiding substantial burdens on their religious exercise, even while confined. At the same time, both the State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence. Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 584, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006). Given these respective interests, a tailored injunction of the sort Ramirez seeks—rather than a stay of execution—will be the proper form of equitable relief when a prisoner raises a RLUIPA claim in the execution context. Cf. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) (Preliminary injunctive relief in a prison conditions suit must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.). Because it is possible to accommodate Ramirez's sincere religious beliefs without delaying or impeding his execution, we conclude that the balance of equities and the public interest favor his requested relief.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,95,"Respondents argue that Ramirez has engaged in inequitable conduct. As they see it, this should bar the equitable relief that Ramirez seeks.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,96,"We agree that a party's inequitable conduct can make equitable relief inappropriate. When a party seeking equitable relief has violated conscience, or good faith, or other equitable principle, in his prior conduct, then the doors of the court will be shut against him. Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240, 245, 54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933) (quoting J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence § 397 (4th ed. 1918)). These well-worn principles of equity apply in capital cases just as in all others. Thus, late-breaking changes in position, last-minute claims arising from long-known facts, and other attempts at manipulation can provide a sound basis for denying equitable relief in capital cases. Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.S. 653, 654, 112 S.Ct. 1652, 118 L.Ed.2d 293 (1992) (per curiam), see also Hill, 547 U.S., at 584, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (A court considering a stay must also apply a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay. (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Roberts,0,
2021-030,97,"Here, however, the record does not support the conclusion that Ramirez engaged in such misconduct. Respondents argue that Ramirez inequitably delayed this litigation by filing suit just four weeks before his scheduled execution. But this is not a  case in which a litigant slept upon his rights. Gildersleeve v. New Mexico Mining Co., 161 U.S. 573, 578, 16 S.Ct. 663, 40 L.Ed. 812 (1896) (quoting Speidel v. Henrici, 120 U.S. 377, 387, 7 S.Ct. 610, 30 L.Ed. 718 (1887)). To the contrary, Ramirez had sought to vindicate his rights for months. He first learned that prison officials would not allow his pastor to lay hands on him in the execution chamber on June 8, 2021. See Part II, supra. That was a break from Texas's longstanding practice. Ramirez filed a Step 1 grievance requesting both prayer and religious touch just three days later. App. 52-53. When that grievance was rejected, he quickly filed a Step 2 grievance. Id., at 155-156. Yet respondents failed to issue a final decision until August 16, 2021-39 days after Ramirez had filed his Step 2 grievance, and just a few weeks before the scheduled execution. To be sure, prison officials issued their decision within the 40 days allowed by Texas's grievance policy. See Prison Handbook 74. But respondents can hardly complain about the inequities of delay when their own actions were a significant contributing factor.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,99,"As we have explained, the resolution of RLUIPA claims in the prisoner context requires a case-specific consideration of the particular circumstances and claims. At the same time, timely resolution of such claims could be facilitated if States were to adopt policies anticipating and addressing issues likely to arise. Doing so would assist both prison officials responsible for carrying out executions and prisoners preparing to confront the end of life according to their religious beliefs.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,100,"The first step would be to specify reasonable rules on the time for prisoners to request religious accommodations, and for prison officials to respond. Cf. Woodford, 548 U.S., at 87-96, 126 S.Ct. 2378. States could also adopt streamlined procedures for claims involving requests like those at issue in this case, so that these potentially complicated matters can be litigated at all levels well in advance of any scheduled execution. If spiritual advisors are to be admitted into the execution chamber, it would also seem reasonable to require some training on procedures, including any restrictions on their movements or conduct. When a spiritual advisor would enter and must leave could be spelled out. If the advisor is to touch the prisoner, the State might also specify where and for how long. And, as noted, if audible prayer is to occur, a variety of considerations might be set forth in advance to avoid disruption. See supra, at 1279-1280. It may also be reasonable to document the advisor's advance agreement to comply with any restrictions.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,101,"If States adopt clear rules in advance, it should be the rare case that requires last-minute resort to the federal courts. If such cases do arise and a court determines that relief is appropriate under RLUIPA, the proper remedy is an injunction ordering the accommodation, not a stay of the execution. This approach balances the State's interest in carrying out capital sentences without delay and the prisoner's interest in religious exercise.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,102,"One final point bears mentioning. Our holding today arises in the context of a preliminary injunction. And our analysis turns on Texas's specific execution protocol, chamber, and historical practices. Further proceedings on remand, if necessary, might shed additional light on Texas's interests, and on whether its policies are narrowly tailored. But such proceedings might also contribute to further delay in carrying out the sentence. The State will have to determine where its interest lies in going forward.",Roberts,0,
2021-030,104,"We hold that Ramirez is likely to prevail on the merits of his RLUIPA claims, and that the other preliminary injunction factors justify relief. If Texas reschedules Ramirez's execution and declines to permit audible prayer or religious touch, the District Court should therefore enter appropriate preliminary relief. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Roberts,0,

2021-030,106,"Justice SOTOMAYOR, concurring.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,107,"The opinion of the Court, which I join in full, explains why clear rules governing the presence of spiritual advisors at executions are necessary to ensure that any disputes are resolved in a timely fashion before a scheduled execution date. I write separately to underscore the interaction between prison officials' obligations to set such rules and the exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,108,"Under the PLRA, prison officials and incarcerated individuals share an obligation to act in good faith in resolving disputes: Incarcerated individuals must timely raise their claims through the prison grievance system, and prison officials must ensure that the system is a functioning one. To that end, the PLRA requires incarcerated individuals to exhaust the prison's administrative grievance process before turning to the courts only where that process is actually available. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). An administrative process is not available if it is not `capable of use' to obtain `some relief for the action complained of.' Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 642, 136 S.Ct. 1850, 195 L.Ed.2d 117 (2016). Availability is a practical determination that requires considering both whether the administrative system is accessible as designed and whether prison administrators and officers ensure meaningful access to it in practice. See id., at 643-644, 136 S.Ct. 1850.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,109,"A scheduled execution date may impose unique time constraints on grievance procedures, but it does not alter either party's responsibilities under the PLRA. Just as incarcerated individuals still bear the burden of timely raising execution-related claims, prisons still must ensure that administrative remedies are available, which may require modifying procedures to account for the time constraints of a scheduled execution as the Court describes, ante, at 1283. Where an administrative process does not facilitate addressing execution-related claims within the timeframe of a scheduled execution, it is likely not an available remedy that must be exhausted under the PLRA.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,110,"To ensure that administrative remedies are available in the execution context, prison officials bear a twofold responsibility. First, they must ensure that rules clearly and timely inform an individual facing execution of any relevant protocols, so that the individual in turn may timely raise concerns. Second, the officials must ensure that the administrative process proceeds swiftly enough to permit exhaustion with sufficient time for the individual to seek judicial review, if necessary, prior to a scheduled execution. Finally, to act in good faith means that neither incarcerated individuals nor prison officials should unnecessarily wait to act until the end of time available to them.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,111,"Because I agree with the Court that Ramirez exhausted his administrative remedies, it is unnecessary to address whether they qualified as available such that exhaustion was actually a prerequisite to  suit.* It raises questions, however, that the record indicates that the prison failed to provide Ramirez with notice of its restrictions on a spiritual advisor's actions in the execution room. Timely notice of policies is essential to ensure the ability to timely raise, or seek informal resolution of, any claims related to those policies. It also raises questions that the prison took 39 days to deny Ramirez's Step 2 grievance, even though the prison had considered and rejected his request previously and maintains that its established policies foreclosed it. Such delay creates an impression, whether valid or not, that the prison is trying to thwart inmates from taking advantage of the grievance process and cut short their opportunity to obtain judicial review. Ross, 578 U.S., at 644, 136 S.Ct. 1850.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,112,"At its heart, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act requires commitment on both sides to achieve a timely resolution of disputes, as does the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. Consistent with these principles, incarcerated individuals should know that delays in raising their requests can result in denial. They should not, however, be penalized for delays attributable to prison administrators.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-030,113,"Justice KAVANAUGH, concurring.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,114,"I join the Court's opinion in full, and I write separately to add three points: one about the recent history of litigation involving religious advisors in execution rooms, a second about the difficulty of applying RLUIPA's compelling interest and least restrictive means standards, and a third about state execution procedures going forward.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,115,"First, the recent history. The question of religious advisors in the execution room came to this Court three years ago as a question of religious equality. Some States had long permitted state-employed chaplains in the execution room. But those state-employed chaplains were mostly Christian. Those States did not allow inmates to have their own religious advisors in the room. Therefore, a Christian inmate could have the state-employed Christian chaplain in the room, but a Buddhist inmate, for example, could not have a Buddhist religious advisor in the room. The Court correctly determined that this practice constituted unlawful religious discrimination because it treated inmates of different religions differently. See Murphy v. Collier, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1475, 203 L.Ed.2d 633 (2019).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,116,"At the same time, the Court stressed that an inmate had to timely raise such a claim so that the execution would not be unreasonably delayed to the detriment of the victims' families, among others. For timeliness reasons, the Court denied relief in the first such claim to reach this Court.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,117,"See Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 725, 209 L.Ed.2d 30 (2019). But the Court then granted relief in the second such claim, which was timely raised. Murphy, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1475.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,118,"The bedrock religious equality principle was easy for States to apply: States could either (i) always allow a religious advisor into the execution room or (ii) always exclude a religious advisor, including any state-employed chaplain. But States could not allow religious advisors of some religions while excluding religious advisors of other religions.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,119,"Then, however, a different kind of claim emerged. In States that equally barred all advisors from the execution room, some inmates brought a religious liberty claim—a claim seeking a religious exemption from an otherwise neutral and generally applicable rule excluding all advisors. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, known as RLUIPA, proscribes the State from substantially burdening an inmate's religious exercise except when the State has a compelling interest and employs the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. See 114 Stat. 803, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq. Suing under RLUIPA, some inmates argued that the State did not have a sufficiently compelling interest to exclude religious advisors from the execution room—or at least that the State could satisfy its asserted safety, security, and solemnity interests by means less restrictive than excluding all religious advisors from the room.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,120,"And then, in this case, still another kind of claim emerged. Ramirez not only wants a religious advisor in the execution room. He also wants the advisor to be able to engage in audible prayer and even to be able to physically touch him during the execution process. Ramirez argues that the State does not have a sufficiently compelling interest to prevent such activities by religious advisors, or at least could satisfy its compelling interests by less restrictive means. For example, security officers in the room could prevent or promptly respond to any disruption or interference.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,121,"As to those RLUIPA claims, the Court previously indicated that a State may not completely exclude religious advisors from the execution room, even if the State equally excludes all advisors on a neutral and generally applicable basis. See ante, at 1273-1274, Gutierrez v. Saenz, 590 U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 127, 207 L.Ed.2d 1075 (2020), Dunn v. Smith, 592 U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 725, 209 L.Ed.2d 30 (2021). And the Court today further holds that the State may not prevent a religious advisor from engaging in at least some audible prayer and physical touching of the inmate while in the execution room. Although the Court concludes that the State has a compelling interest in ensuring the safety, security, and solemnity of the execution room, the Court decides that the State can satisfy those interests by means less restrictive than excluding religious advisors altogether or restricting religious advisors from audible prayer and touching.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,122,"Second, the Court's holding implicates significant issues about how the Court decides whether a State's asserted interest is sufficiently compelling and how the Court assesses whether less restrictive means could satisfy that compelling interest. This case illustrates both the difficulty of those inquiries and the important role that history and state practice often play in the analysis.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,123,"The compelling interest standard of RLUIPA—like the compelling interest standard that the Court employs when applying strict scrutiny to examine state limitations on certain constitutional rights—necessarily operates as a balancing test. See generally B. Kavanaugh, Two  Challenges for the Judge as Umpire: Statutory Ambiguity and Constitutional Exceptions, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1907, 1914-1919 (2017). The Court starts with a heavy presumption against a state law that infringes the constitutional or statutory right in question. The Court allows state infringement on that right only when the State has a sufficiently compelling interest. See Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 444, 135 S.Ct. 1656, 191 L.Ed.2d 570 (2015).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,124,"But what does compelling mean, and how does the Court determine when the State's interest rises to that level? And how does the Court then determine whether less restrictive means would still satisfy that interest? Good questions, for which there are no great answers. Sometimes, the Court looks to a State's policy-based or commonsense arguments. Often, the Court also examines history and contemporary state practice to inform the inquiries. Cf. Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 785-787, 122 S.Ct. 2528, 153 L.Ed.2d 694 (2002) (Scalia, J., for the Court).1",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,125,"Here, the State asserts that it has a compelling interest in ensuring the safety, security, and solemnity of the execution room. To further those interests, the State has sought to restrict the number of people in the room, as well as their activities. As the United States pointed out at oral argument, any disruption or interference could be catastrophic. Tr. of Oral Arg. 69. And a religious advisor would not ordinarily be allowed in a public hospital's operating room during a major life-or-death surgical procedure, so why should one be allowed into the execution room?",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,126,"The Court has no difficulty reaching the commonsense conclusion that the State has a compelling interest in ensuring safety, security, and solemnity in the execution room. The more difficult question is: How much risk of disruption or interference must the State tolerate in order to accommodate the inmate's religious liberty claim under RLUIPA?",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,127,"The Court concludes that, even if audible prayer and physical touching are allowed, the State can still sufficiently ensure safety, security, and solemnity in the execution room. The Court suggests that the risk of disruption or interference is conjecture and can be addressed in other ways. For example, security officers in the room could immediately intervene if the religious advisor accidentally or intentionally disrupts or interferes with the execution.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,128,"Even so, it is undeniable that allowing an outside individual in an execution room and allowing touching would increase the risk of a problem occurring, such as accidental or intentional disruption of or interference with the execution. So why can't the State choose to avoid any additional risk of disruption or interference, especially given the potentially catastrophic harm  if the risked disruption or interference actually ensues?",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,129,"That is a difficult question to answer, in my view. The core problem is that a State's understandable goal of avoiding a higher risk of great harm does not easily map onto the compelling interest/least restrictive means standards. In particular, it is difficult for a court applying those standards to know where to draw the line—that is, how much additional risk of great harm is too much for a court to order the State to bear.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,130,"Here, if the Court's own intuitive policy assessment that the State can reasonably tolerate the additional risk were all that the Court could muster in response to the State's argument, I might have concluded that the State could exclude religious advisors from the execution room, or at least could restrict their activities in the room and not allow physical touching, for example.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,131,"Importantly, however, the Court does not merely point to its own policy assessment of how much risk the State must tolerate in the execution room. The Court also relies in part on the history of religious advisors at executions. To be sure, the Court acknowledges that some of the history is not precisely on point because many executions historically were outdoor public hangings where the presence of religious advisors did not raise the same risks to safety, security, and solemnity that their presence in a small execution room does. And some of the other history involved state-employed chaplains, who arguably do not raise the same risks to safety, security, and solemnity as outsiders in the execution room. Still, the history generally demonstrates that religious advisors have often been present at executions. And perhaps even more relevant, the Federal Government and some States have recently allowed inmates' religious advisors into the execution room. Those religious advisors have been allowed to engage in audible prayer and limited touching of the inmate without apparent problems. See ante, at 1278-1279. As the Court explains, experience matters in assessing whether less restrictive alternatives could still satisfy the State's compelling interest. Cf. Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 368-369, 135 S.Ct. 853, 190 L.Ed.2d 747 (2015).2",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,132,"In short, as this case demonstrates, the compelling interest and least restrictive means standards require this Court to make difficult judgments about the strength of the State's interests and whether those interests can be satisfied in other ways that are less restrictive of religious exercise. Although the compelling interest and least restrictive means standards are necessarily imprecise, history and state practice can at least help structure the inquiry and focus the Court's assessment of the State's arguments.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,133,"Third, turning from the doctrinal to the practical, States seek clarity going forward. States understandably want to know  what they may and may not do to regulate the time and manner of audible prayer and touching in the execution room. In its opinion today, the Court supplies some guidance.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-030,134,"Because the Court's guidance does not purport to answer every question, however, a dose of caution for the States is probably in order, especially given the Court's recent case law on this issue and the extraordinary micromanagement of the execution room that RLUIPA has ushered in. The States of course may ensure the safety, security, and solemnity of the execution room. But to avoid persistent future litigation and the accompanying delays, it may behoove States to try to accommodate an inmate's timely and reasonable requests about a religious advisor's presence and activities in the execution room if the States can do so without meaningfully sacrificing their compelling interests in safety, security, and solemnity. Doing so not only would help States avoid future litigation delays but also would serve the exceptionally powerful interests of victims' families in finally obtaining closure.",Kavanaugh,0,

2021-030,164,"This equitable rule is especially important in the death penalty context. Unsurprisingly, death-row inmates generally employ any means available to stave off their sentences and therefore often engage in abusive litigation. See Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U.S. 377, 380, 104 S.Ct. 752, 78 L.Ed.2d 541 (1984) (Powell, J., concurring) (noting a pattern). And this Court has warned that, while zealous counsel for the condemned in a capital case understandably lay hold of every ground which, in their judgment, might tend to the advantage of their client, they should not interfere with the administration of justice on mere pretexts.

2021-030,165,"Prisoners engage in abusive litigation in several different ways. For instance, some prisoners hold off bringing new claims until the last minute in order to force courts to stay or enjoin an execution simply to afford themselves more time to consider the merits of the claims.

Sanders, 373 U.S., at 18, 83 S.Ct. 1068 (noting that federal courts should not tolerate needless piecemeal litigation, or  entertain collateral proceedings whose only purpose is to vex, harass, or delay). And, in many other ways, yet more prisoners deliberately engage in dilatory tactics designed to drag execution-delaying claims out indefinitely. Rhines v.

The record all but speaks for itself. In August 2020, when Ramirez first demanded that Texas allow his pastor into the chamber, he explicitly avowed that his pastor need not touch him at any time in the execution chamber. App. 61. Taking Ramirez at his word, Texas eventually acquiesced. But then Ramirez flipped his position and filed another administrative grievance and § 1983 complaint demanding what he had earlier disclaimed: touching in the execution chamber. See id., at 19, 52. This is a textbook example of dilatory and abusive piecemeal litigation against which we have warned courts in equity to guard. See Hill, 547 U.S., at 585, 126 S.Ct. 2096. Like Chief Judge Owen, I think that the shift in Ramirez's litigation posture alone justifies denying equitable relief because it indicates that the change in position is strategic and that delay is the goal. 10 F.4th at 562 (Owen, C.

But after one witness, Ramirez instructed his lawyer to call no more. The state court found Ramirez competent and honored his decision. Predictably, he was sentenced to death. Yet, during state habeas proceedings, Ramirez nonetheless brought a claim (among several others) accusing his state trial counsel of ineffective assistance for failing to provide an adequate mitigation defense. Ramirez, 641 Fed.Appx. at 315, 326-327.

Among them, he again claimed that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance for failing to call more mitigation witnesses. The District Court proceedings alone bought Ramirez another 20 months, at the end of which the District Court  ruled that all of his claims were procedurally barred, lacked merit, or both. The court also declined to issue a certificate of appealability on any claim, see Ramirez v. Stephens, 2015 WL 3629639, *26 (SD Tex., June 10, 2015), meaning that it thought no reasonable jurists would believe its decision to deny relief was even debatable, Slack v.

Through new counsel, Ramirez argued that his prior federal habeas counsel suffered from a conflict of interest and had abandoned him during clemency proceedings. Ramirez suggested that he needed a stay because he might try to reopen his habeas judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Citing the short time remaining before Ramirez's execution and the immediacy of the situation, the District Court granted the stay two days before the scheduled execution, Ramirez v. Davis, No. 2:12-CV-410, ECF Doc. 48, pp. 1, 9 (SD Tex., Jan. 31, 2017), which the Court of Appeals affirmed the next day, see Ramirez v. Davis, 675 Fed.

The District Court admonished Ramirez for his unreasonably delayed motion before dismissing it on procedural and jurisdictional grounds. ECF Doc. 80, p. 11 (SD Tex., Jan. 3, 2019).

Ramirez long has denied Texas its sovereign interest in seeing that sentence carried out fairly and expeditiously. Bucklew, 587 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1134. Moreover, the legal uncertainty surrounding Texas' death penalty protocols that his litigation engendered has led to further delays in at least four other Texas cases.

2021-030,185,"Consider first Ramirez's inequitable conduct. The majority acknowledges that `the doors of the court will be shut against' a prisoner who engages in abusive litigation. Ante, at 1282 (quoting Keystone Driller, 290 U.S., at 245, 54 S.Ct. 146). But it proceeds as though the abusive-litigation inquiry asks only whether a litigant `slept upon his rights.' Ante, at 1283 (quoting Gildersleeve v. New Mexico Mining Co., 161 U.S. 573, 578, 16 S.Ct. 663, 40 L.Ed. 812 (1896)). As described above, last-minute litigation is but one of several types of abusive and manipulative litigation that death-row inmates employ to delay their executions. See supra, at 1292-1293, see also, e.g., Hill, 547 U.S., at 584-585, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (separately listing abusive claims that are speculative, filed too late in the day, repetitive, or piecemeal). Here, Ramirez not only brought his claims piecemeal, he executed a bait and switch. He first demanded his pastor's presence without touching, but then shifted and demanded touching when requesting Moore's presence alone no longer gave him an excuse for delay. The majority's analysis simply fails to factor in Ramirez's inequitable conduct.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,186,"In any event, the timing of Ramirez's claims still cuts against granting equitable relief. True, this was not an 11th-hour blitz of the sort that Ramirez carried out in 2017. But Ramirez should have communicated his touching claim no later than September 2020, when he expressly disclaimed any need for it. Instead, he parceled out his claims tactically to drag out the time before his sentence, finally asking for in-chambers touching in June 2021, mere months before the September 2021 execution date.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,187,"Worse, the majority bypasses the `important interest' that both the State and Ramirez's victims have in the execution. Ante, at 1271 (quoting Hill, 547 U.S., at 584, 126 S.Ct. 2096). It does not mention that the question of capital punishment belongs to the people and their representatives, not the courts, to resolve. Bucklew, 587 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1133-1134. It does not discuss the pain that every delay has inflicted on Castro's family. See supra, at ___ _ ___. And it does not acknowledge that the heinous nature of the offense—the brutal slaying of a working father during a robbery spree to supply a drug habit—magnified the State's and the victims' shared interest in the prompt execution of Ramirez's capital sentence. In re Federal Bureau of Prisons' Execution Protocol Cases, 955 F.3d at 127 (Katsas, J., concurring). Texas' citizens and Castro's family deserve more consideration and better treatment than the majority gives them.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,188,"Instead, the majority discounts these considerations because it thinks it can resolve  the case without delaying or impeding Ramirez's execution. Ante, at 1282. Of course, that is self-evidently wrong. We are now many months past what was Ramirez's third execution date. And, in the mine run of cases, the majority's approach will not do all that it promises. The majority proposes that when a federal court determines that relief is appropriate under RLUIPA, the proper remedy is an injunction ordering the accommodation, not a stay of the execution. Ante, at 1283. According to the majority, this approach balances the State's interest in carrying out capital sentences without delay and the prisoner's interest in religious exercise. Ibid. But if the State has the temerity to challenge a federal court's assessment of its execution-chamber protocols under RLUIPA, the State must necessarily pursue further proceedings. Ante, at 1283. Doing so might also contribute to further delay in carrying out the sentence, ibid., for which the State will now be at fault. Thus, the State will have to determine where its interest lies in going forward. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,189,"Here is how the majority's test will likely play out in practice: Prisoners, ably represented by the death penalty defense bar, will propose new accommodations tailored to elicit an objection from the State. They will then have three levels of federal-court review in which to litigate whether the State has complied with RLUIPA. From the outset, many district courts will find that RLUIPA demands an accommodation. They will then put the State to a stark choice: capitulate to the court-ordered accommodation that it thinks is dangerous, or litigate and delay the execution, knowing that the delay will count against it in the equitable balance. Now seen as the blameworthy party, the State that chooses to litigate will hardly be able to complain about the inequities of delay caused by a prisoner's last-minute filings, because the court will hold that the State's own actions were a significant contributing factor. Ante, at 1283. Thereafter, the district court and court of appeals will be less likely to dismiss a prisoner's abusive lawsuit because, after all, both sides will have been liable for the delay. And, like here, the result will be months or years of federally imposed stasis. The State, its citizens, and the victims will pay the price of that delay.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,191,"Equities aside, I also doubt Ramirez is likely to succeed on the merits of his touching claim. To prevail, Ramirez will have to show that his request is sincerely based on a religious belief. Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 360-361, 135 S.Ct. 853, 190 L.Ed.2d 747 (2015). The propensity of some prisoners to assert claims of dubious sincerity is well documented. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 718, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014). So, just as federal courts have a duty to deny equitable relief to prisoners engaged in vexatious litigation, they likewise have a duty under RLUIPA to deny religious liberty claims when prisoners are insincere. See ibid. (Congress passed RLUIPA confident of the ability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims), Holt, 574 U.S., at 369, 135 S.Ct. 853 (noting that prison officials may question the authenticity of a prisoner's religious belief), Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725, n. 13, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (same). The evidence that demonstrates Ramirez is bringing abusive litigation to delay his execution also strongly suggests that he does not sincerely believe that his pastor needs to touch him in the execution chamber.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,192,"The majority concedes that Ramirez's evolving litigation position is evidence of insincerity, but concludes that ample  evidence cuts the other way. Ante, at 1278. The majority's countervailing evidence, however, falls short of showing any sincerity, let alone a clear showing that Ramirez is entitled to  relief. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972, 117 S.Ct. 1865, 138 L.Ed.2d 162 (1997) (per curiam)). The majority's primary support is that the laying of hands is a traditional form of religious exercise and that Moore engages in the practice. Ante, at 1277. But whether Ramirez's supposed belief is traditional is irrelevant. RLUIPA's protection, like the protection of the First Amendment, is not restricted to orthodox religious practices. Follett v. Town of McCormick, 321 U.S. 573, 577, 64 S.Ct. 717, 88 L.Ed. 938 (1944), see also N. Chapman, Adjudicating Religious Sincerity, 92 Wash. L. Rev. 1185, 1197-1202 (2017). The relevant issue is whether Ramirez himself actually believes that it is part of his faith to have his spiritual advisor lay hands on him. App. 52. To that point, the majority cites nothing other than Ramirez's bare grievance—precisely the same evidence that shows the evolving litigation position that the majority concedes is evidence of insincerity. Thus, the only relevant evidence in this case cuts strongly in favor of finding that Ramirez is insincere.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,194,"Ramirez also asks us to intervene in his long-delayed execution because Texas will not allow his pastor to pray audibly in the execution chamber. Given Ramirez's history, I suspect that his goal in raising this claim is also to secure delay. But his audible-prayer claim suffers from an antecedent defect: Ramirez did not comply with the PLRA by exhausting the administrative remedies available to him before bringing his claim to federal court. Because he failed to carry out this mandatory, congressionally imposed threshold requirement, I would dismiss his claim.",Thomas,0,

Whether Ramirez made no effort to resolve this grievance, or he simply failed to document his efforts to do so, makes no difference under the PLRA, he did not comply either way. And that failure is not trivial. Several prisons have imposed a threshold requirement that prisoners attempt to resolve their issues informally and then document that attempt. See Woodford, 548 U.S., at 85-86, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (describing California's informal resolution requirement), see also, e.g., Little v. Jones, 607 F.3d 1245, 1249 (C.A.10 2010) (describing Oklahoma's informal first step). This step 0 is critical —it reduces the administrative burden on prison adjudicatory authorities and avoids turning minor misunderstandings into formal adversarial proceedings. Ramirez's failure to comply with this critical procedural rule means that he failed to exhaust his audible-prayer claim properly. Woodford, 548 U.S., at 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,200,"Second, in the section of the Step 1 form where the prisoner is supposed to state his grievance, Ramirez said nothing about audible prayer. App. 52. Ramirez mentioned only that he wanted his pastor to lay hands on him in the chamber. Ibid. It was that laying of hands, alone, that Ramirez identified as part of his faith. Ibid. Ramirez thus denied Texas a fair and full opportunity to adjudicate his new audible-prayer claim. Woodford, 548 U.S., at 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378. That failure, like his failure to seek informal resolution, is no small matter. Absent proper presentation of a grievance pursuant to procedures that impose some orderly structure on the course of  proceedings, no adjudicative system can function effectively. Id., at 90-91, 126 S.Ct. 2378. To avoid that breakdown, States like Texas must be able to rely on federal courts to decline entertaining lawsuits that do not comply with the PLRA. Otherwise, because prisoners do not want to exhaust and have no incentive to do so, they will stop following prison procedures, and the benefit of administrative adjudication will be lost. Id., at 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,202,"The majority does not dispute these procedural shortcomings. Regarding Ramirez's failure to seek informal resolution, it says nothing. And, on Ramirez's failure to state a grievance, the majority itself ignores Texas' procedural rules. The majority notes that, in the section of Ramirez's grievance where he was required to state the action requested to resolve his complaint, Ramirez wrote: That I be ALLOWED to have my Spiritual Advisor `lay hands on me' & pray over me while I am being executed. App. 53. That is not enough. For one, the statement appears in the wrong part of the grievance form. There would be a substantial loss in administrative efficiency if prison officials had to rummage through different parts of  a grievance form to discern what the grievance actually is. For another, that single statement is woefully imprecise. The State is free to decide the level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance procedures. Jones, 549 U.S., at 218, 127 S.Ct. 910. Texas defined one here—the handbook instructs that the specific action required to resolve the complaint shall be clearly stated in the space provided on the I-127 form. Prison Handbook 75 (emphasis added). Ramirez did not clearly describe the relief he now says he wants. His fleeting, general reference to prayer, lodged in the wrong section of a form with a request for in-chambers touching, did not put Texas officials on notice of what he was demanding. That Ramirez felt the need to amend his August 2021 § 1983 complaint explicitly to include audible prayers proves the point. App. 91 (Second Amended Complaint).",Thomas,0,
2021-030,203,"But even if he had, Ramirez would have failed to satisfy the PLRA for yet another reason. If the grievance had, in fact, presented two claims, neither of them would have been properly exhausted because Texas prisoners may present only one issue per grievance. Prison Handbook 74. An issue is a point in dispute between two or more parties. Black's Law Dictionary 995 (11th ed. 2019). The touching claim and the audible-prayer claim present two independent issues, each of which (as this litigation demonstrates) represents a different point of dispute calling for independent analysis. See Ramirez v. Collier, 594 U.S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 50, 210 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2021) (ordering briefing on whether Texas rules restricting either audible prayer or physical contact burdened Ramirez), compare ante, at 1275-1276 (first addressing the audible-prayer claim), with ante, at 1276-1277 (then addressing the touching claim), ante, at 1281-1282 (acknowledging multiple claims). If Ramirez had raised his audible-prayer claim on the June 11 grievance form, he would have violated Texas procedures by doing so, meaning he would not have properly exhausted either claim at issue here. See Woodford, 548 U.S., at 88, 93, 126 S.Ct. 2378.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,204,"Finally, for his part, Ramirez raises one additional argument on which the majority does not rely. He argues that the State's changing position over what it would permit in the execution chamber rendered the administrative grievance process unavailable to him, and therefore he was under no obligation to exhaust administrative remedies. Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 643, 136 S.Ct. 1850, 195 L.Ed.2d 117 (2016). But Ramirez's own conduct belies that claim. He used the grievance process twice in the lead up to the execution date. See, e.g., App. 50-55. The State responded to his concerns. The first time, the State acquiesced, allowing his pastor into the chamber. Id., at 55. The second time, the State did not, denying his request to allow his pastor to lay hands on him. Id., at 53. So, each time, the administrative review process was available to him. He cannot now blame a system that his own experience shows he was `capable of using.' Ross, 578 U.S., at 642, 136 S.Ct. 1850 (quoting Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 738, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001)).* * *",Thomas,0,
2021-030,205,"This case well demonstrates why a prisoner's failure to exhaust under the PLRA should not be excused. If Ramirez had pursued administrative remedies properly, the State would have had a fair opportunity to consider his grievance. Woodford, 548 U.S., at 95, 126 S.Ct. 2378. For example, an attempt at informal resolution might have allowed the prison chaplain or other officials to resolve his request at an earlier juncture. Or, if Ramirez had given  prison officials any notice of his request in a formal grievance, he and the State might have been able to come up with a compromise before federal litigation turned them into adversaries. Id., at 89, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (noting the value of settling claims at the administrative level). At the very least, we might have had a more robust administrative record with which to assess the burdens, interests, and state rules on which his RLUIPA claims hinge. See id., at 95, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (noting that proper exhaustion often results in the creation of an administrative record that is helpful to the court). Such a record might have obviated the need to wait for the further proceedings on remand that the majority now thinks are necessary to illuminate the State's interests. Ante, at 1283-1284.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,207,"In RLUIPA, Congress created a potent tool with which prisoners can protect their sincerely held religious beliefs. But, like any tool, it can be wielded abusively. And few have a greater incentive to do so than death-row inmates. To counter such abuse, federal courts sitting in equity have a duty to dismiss piecemeal, late-breaking, dilatory, specious, speculative, or manipulative litigation. RLUIPA itself complements that process by requiring a prisoner to demonstrate sincerity.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,208,"Meanwhile, Congress passed the PLRA to force prisoners to exhaust their complaints through state prisons' administrative review processes so that prison officials might resolve, or at least build a record to help shed light on, an alleged problem before it escalates to litigation. Federal courts have a duty under the PLRA to dismiss these unexhausted claims.",Thomas,0,
2021-030,209,"Today, the Court shrugs off both of these duties. It grants equitable relief for a demonstrably abusive and insincere claim filed by a prisoner with an established history of seeking unjustified delay, harming the State and Ramirez's victims in the process. The Court also forgives the same prisoner's complete failure to exhaust another claim. Because I would deny equitable relief for the first claim and dismiss the second under the PLRA, I respectfully dissent.",Thomas,0,
2021-033,33,"The Court granted certiorari before judgment in this case to determine whether, under our precedents, certain abortion  providers can pursue a pre-enforcement challenge to a recently enacted Texas statute. We conclude that such an action is permissible against some of the named defendants but not others.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,35,"Earlier this year Texas passed the Texas Heartbeat Act, 87th Leg., Reg. Sess., also known as S. B. 8. The Act prohibits physicians from knowingly performing or inducing an abortion on a pregnant woman if the physician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child unless a medical emergency prevents compliance. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 171.204(a), 171.205(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021). But the law generally does not allow state officials to bring criminal prosecutions or civil enforcement actions. Instead, S. B. 8 directs enforcement through  private civil actions culminating in injunctions and statutory damages awards against those who perform or assist prohibited abortions. §§ 171.207(a), 171.208(a)(2), (3). The law also provides a defense. Tracking language from Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the statute permits abortion providers to defeat any suit against them by showing, among other things, that holding them liable would place an undue burden on women seeking abortions. §§ 171.209(a)-(b).1",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,36,"After the law's adoption, various abortion providers sought to test its constitutionality. Not wishing to wait for S. B. 8 actions in which they might raise their arguments in defense, they filed their own pre-enforcement lawsuits. In all, they brought 14 such challenges in state court seeking, among other things, a declaration that S. B. 8 is inconsistent with both the Federal and Texas Constitutions. A summary judgment ruling in these now-consolidated cases arrived last night, in which the abortion providers prevailed on certain of their claims. Van Stean v. Texas, No. D-1-GN-21-004179 (Dist. Ct. Travis Cty., Tex., Dec. 9, 2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,37,"Another group of providers, including the petitioners before us, filed a pre-enforcement action in federal court. In their complaint, the petitioners alleged that S. B. 8 violates the Federal Constitution and sought an injunction barring the following defendants from taking any action to enforce the statute: a state-court judge, Austin Jackson, a state-court clerk, Penny Clarkston, Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, executive director of the Texas Medical Board, Stephen Carlton, executive director of the Texas Board of Nursing, Katherine Thomas, executive director of the Texas Board of Pharmacy, Allison Benz, executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Cecile Young, and a single private party, Mark Lee Dickson.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,38,"Shortly after the petitioners filed their federal complaint, the individual defendants employed by Texas moved to dismiss, citing among other things the doctrine of sovereign immunity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. The sole private defendant, Mr. Dickson, also moved to dismiss, claiming that the petitioners lacked standing to sue him. 13 F.4th 434, 445 (CA5 2021) (per curiam). The District Court denied the motions. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,39,"The defendants employed by Texas responded by pursuing an interlocutory appeal in the Fifth Circuit under the collateral order doctrine. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v.

Mr. Dickson also filed an interlocutory appeal. The Fifth Circuit agreed to take up his appeal because the issues it raised overlapped with those already before the court in the Texas official defendants' appeal. 13 F.4th at 438-439.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,40,"Separately, the petitioners also sought relief from the Fifth Circuit. Citing S. B. 8's impending effective date, they asked the court to issue an injunction suspending the law's enforcement until the court could hear and decide the merits of the defendants' appeals. Ibid. The Fifth Circuit declined the petitioners' request. Instead, that court issued an order staying proceedings in the District Court until it could resolve the defendants' appeals. App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a, 13 F.4th at 438-439, 443.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,41,"In response to these developments, the petitioners sought emergency injunctive relief in this Court. In their filing, the petitioners asked us to enjoin any enforcement of S. B. 8. And given the statute's approaching effective date, they asked us to rule within two days. The Court took up the application and, in the abbreviated time available for review, concluded that the petitioners' submission failed to identify a basis in existing law sufficient to justify disturbing the Court of Appeals' decision denying injunctive relief. Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2494, 210 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,42,"After that ruling, the petitioners filed a second emergency request. This time they asked the Court to grant certiorari before judgment to resolve the defendants' interlocutory appeals in the first instance, without awaiting the views of the Fifth Circuit. This Court granted the petitioners' request and set the case for expedited briefing and argument. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 415, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,44,"Because this Court granted certiorari before judgment, we effectively stand in the shoes of the Court of Appeals. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 690-692, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice 2-11 (11th ed. 2019). In this case, that means we must review the defendants' appeals challenging the District Court's order denying their motions to dismiss. As with any interlocutory appeal, our review is limited to the particular orders under review and any other ruling inextricably intertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of them. Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). In this preliminary posture, the ultimate merits question—whether S. B. 8 is consistent with the Federal Constitution—is not before the Court. Nor is the wisdom of S. B. 8 as a matter of public policy.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,46,"Turning to the matters that are properly put to us, we begin with the sovereign immunity appeal involving the state-court judge, Austin Jackson, and the state-court clerk, Penny Clarkston. While this lawsuit names only one state-court judge and one state-court clerk as defendants, the petitioners explain that they hope eventually to win certification of a class including all  Texas state-court judges and clerks as defendants. In the end, the petitioners say, they intend to seek an order enjoining all state-court clerks from docketing S. B. 8 cases and all state-court judges from hearing them.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,47,"Almost immediately, however, the petitioners' theory confronts a difficulty. Generally, States are immune from suit under the terms of the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See, e.g., Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). To be sure, in Ex parte Young, this Court recognized a narrow exception grounded in traditional equity practice— one that allows certain private parties to seek judicial orders in federal court preventing state executive officials from enforcing state laws that are contrary to federal law. 209 U.S. 123, 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). But as Ex parte Young explained, this traditional exception does not normally permit federal courts to issue injunctions against state-court judges or clerks. Usually, those individuals do not enforce state laws as executive officials might, instead, they work to resolve disputes between parties. If a state court errs in its rulings, too, the traditional remedy has been some form of appeal, including to this Court, not the entry of an ex ante injunction preventing the state court from hearing cases. As Ex parte Young put it, an injunction against a state court or its machinery would be a violation of the whole scheme of our Government. Id., at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,48,"Nor is that the only problem confronting the petitioners' court-and-clerk theory. Article III of the Constitution affords federal courts the power to resolve only actual controversies arising between adverse litigants. Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 361, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246 (1911). Private parties who seek to bring S. B. 8 suits in state court may be litigants adverse to the petitioners. But the state-court clerks who docket those disputes and the state-court judges who decide them generally are not. Clerks serve to file cases as they arrive, not to participate as adversaries in those disputes. Judges exist to resolve controversies about a law's meaning or its conformance to the Federal and State Constitutions, not to wage battle as contestants in the parties' litigation. As this Court has explained, no case or controversy exists between a judge who adjudicates claims under a statute and a litigant who attacks the constitutionality of the statute. Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 538, n. 18, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,49,"Then there is the question of remedy. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 24 directs state-court clerks to accept complaints and record case numbers. The petitioners have pointed to nothing in Texas law that permits clerks to pass on the substance of the filings they docket—let alone refuse a party's complaint based on an assessment of its merits. Nor does Article III confer on federal judges some amorphous power to supervise the operations of government and reimagine from the ground up the job description of Texas state-court clerks. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 829, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,50,"Troubling, too, the petitioners have not offered any meaningful limiting principles for their theory. If it caught on and federal judges could enjoin state courts and clerks from entertaining disputes between private parties under this state law, what would stop federal judges from prohibiting state courts and clerks from hearing and docketing disputes between private parties under other state laws? And if the state courts and clerks somehow qualify as adverse litigants for Article III purposes in  the present case, when would they not? The petitioners offer no satisfactory answers.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,51,"Instead, only further questions follow. Under the petitioners' theory, would clerks have to assemble a blacklist of banned claims subject to immediate dismissal? What kind of inquiry would a state court have to apply to satisfy due process before dismissing those suits? How notorious would the alleged constitutional defects of a claim have to be before a state-court clerk would risk legal jeopardy merely for filing it? Would States have to hire independent legal counsel for their clerks—and would those advisers be the next target of suits seeking injunctive relief? When a party hales a state-court clerk into federal court for filing a complaint containing a purportedly unconstitutional claim, how would the clerk defend himself consistent with his ethical obligation of neutrality? See Tex. Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3(B)(10) (2021) (instructing judges and court staff to abstain from taking public positions on pending or impending proceedings). Could federal courts enjoin those who perform other ministerial tasks potentially related to litigation, like the postal carrier who delivers complaints to the courthouse? Many more questions than answers would present themselves if the Court journeyed this way.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,52,"Our colleagues writing separately today supply no answers either. They agree that state-court judges are not proper defendants in this lawsuit because they are in no sense adverse to the parties whose cases they decide. Post, at 544-545 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). At the same time, our colleagues say they would allow this case to proceed against clerks like Ms. Clarkston. See ibid., see also post, at 548 549 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But in doing so they fail to address the many remedial questions their path invites. They neglect to explain how clerks who merely docket S. B. 8 lawsuits can be considered adverse litigants for Article III purposes while the judges they serve cannot. And they fail to reconcile their views with Ex parte Young. THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges, for example, that clerks set in motion the `machinery' of court proceedings. Post, at 544. Yet he disregards Ex parte Young's express teaching against enjoining the machinery of courts. 209 U.S. at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,53,"Justice SOTOMAYOR seems to admit at least part of the problem. She concedes that older wooden authorities like Ex parte Young appear to prohibit suits against state-court clerks. Post, at 548-549. Still, she insists, we should disregard those cases in favor of more modern case law. Ibid. In places, THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion seems to pursue much the same line of argument. See post, at 544-545. But even overlooking all the other problems attending our colleagues' clerks-only theory, the authorities they cite do not begin to do the work attributed to them.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,54,"Most prominently, our colleagues point to Pulliam. But that case had nothing to do with state-court clerks, injunctions against them, or the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Instead, the Court faced only the question whether the suit before it could proceed against a judge consistent with the distinct doctrine of judicial immunity. 466 U.S. at 541-543, 104 S.Ct. 1970. As well, the plaintiff sought an injunction only to prevent the judge from enforcing a rule of her own creation. Id., at 526, 104 S.Ct. 1970. No one asked the Court to prevent the judge from processing the case consistent with state statutory law, let alone undo Ex parte Young's teaching that federal courts lack such power under traditional equitable principles. Tellingly, our colleagues do not read Pulliam to authorize claims against state-court judges in this  case. And given that, it is a mystery how they might invoke the case as authority for claims against (only) state-court clerks, officials Pulliam never discussed.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,55,"If anything, the remainder of our colleagues' cases are even further afield. Mitchum v. Foster did not involve statecourt clerks, but a judge, prosecutor, and sheriff. See 315 F.Supp. 1387, 1388 (ND Fla. 1970) (per curiam). When it came to these individuals, the Court held only that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar suit against them. 407 U.S. 225, 242-243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972). Once more, the Court did not purport to pass judgment on any sovereign immunity defense, let alone suggest any disagreement with Ex parte Young. To the contrary, the Court went out of its way to emphasize that its decision should not be taken as passing on the question whether principles of equity, comity, and federalism might bar the suit. 407 U.S. at 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151. Meanwhile, Shelley v. Kraemer did not even involve a pre-enforcement challenge against any state-official defendant. 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). There, the petitioners simply sought to raise the Constitution as a defense against other private parties seeking to enforce a restrictive covenant, id., at 14, 68 S.Ct. 836, much as the petitioners here would be able to raise the Constitution as a defense in any S. B. 8 enforcement action brought by others against them. Simply put, nothing in any of our colleagues' cases supports their novel suggestion that we should allow a pre-enforcement action for injunctive relief against state-court clerks, all while simultaneously holding the judges they serve immune.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,57,"Perhaps recognizing the problems with their court-and-clerk theory, the petitioners briefly advance an alternative. They say they seek to enjoin the Texas attorney general from enforcing S. B. 8. Such an injunction, the petitioners submit, would also automatically bind any private party who might try to bring an S. B. 8 suit against them. Reply Brief for Petitioners 21. But the petitioners barely develop this back-up theory in their briefing, and it too suffers from some obvious problems.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,58,"Start with perhaps the most straightforward. While Ex parte Young authorizes federal courts to enjoin certain state officials from enforcing state laws, the petitioners do not direct this Court to any enforcement authority the attorney general possesses in connection with S. B. 8 that a federal court might enjoin him from exercising. Maybe the closest the petitioners come is when they point to a state statute that says the attorney general may institute an action for a civil penalty of $1,000 for violations of this subtitle or a rule or order adopted by the Texas Medical Board. Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 165.101 (West 2012). But the qualification this subtitle limits the attorney general's enforcement authority to the Texas Occupational Code, specifically §§ 151.001 through 171.024. By contrast, S. B. 8 is codified in the Texas Health and Safety Code at §§ 171.201-171.212. The Act thus does not fall within this subtitle. Nor have the petitioners identified for us any rule or order adopted by the Texas Medical Board related to S. B. 8 that the attorney general might enforce against them. To be sure, some of our colleagues suggest that the Board might in the future promulgate such a rule and the attorney general might then undertake an enforcement action. Post, at 544 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing 22 Tex. Admin. Code § 190.8(7) (West 2021)). But this is a series of hypotheticals and an argument even the petitioners do not attempt to advance for themselves.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,59,"Even if we could overcome this problem, doing so would only expose another. Supposing the attorney general did have some enforcement authority under S. B. 8, the petitioners have identified nothing that might allow a federal court to parlay that authority, or any defendant's enforcement authority, into an injunction against any and all unnamed private persons who might seek to bring their own S. B. 8 suits. The equitable powers of federal courts are limited by historical practice. Atlas Life Ins. Co. v. W. I. Southern, Inc., 306 U.S. 563, 568, 59 S.Ct. 657, 83 L.Ed. 987 (1939). A court of equity is as much so limited as a court of law. Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.). Consistent with historical practice, a federal court exercising its equitable authority may enjoin named defendants from taking specified unlawful actions. But under traditional equitable principles, no court may lawfully enjoin the world at large, ibid., or purport to enjoin challenged laws themselves, Whole Woman's Health, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2495 (citing California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2115-2116, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,60,"Our colleagues offer no persuasive reply to this problem. THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not address it. Meanwhile, Justice SOTOMAYOR offers a radical answer, suggesting once more that this Court should cast aside its precedents requiring federal courts to abide by traditional equitable principles. Post, at 549, n. 3. This time, however, Justice SOTOMAYOR does not claim to identify any countervailing authority to support her proposal. Instead, she says, it is justified purely by the fact that the State of Texas in S. B. 8 has delegated its enforcement authority to the world at large. Ibid. But somewhat analogous complaints could be levied against private attorneys general acts, statutes allowing for private rights of action, tort law, federal antitrust law, and even the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In some sense all of these laws delegate the enforcement of public policy to private parties and reward those who bring suits with bounties like exemplary or statutory damages and attorney's fees. Nor does Justice SOTOMAYOR explain where her novel plan to overthrow this Court's precedents and expand the equitable powers of federal courts would stop—or on what theory it might plausibly happen to reach just this case or maybe those exactly like it.2",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,62,"While this Court's precedents foreclose some of the petitioners' claims for relief, others survive. The petitioners also name as defendants Stephen Carlton, Katherine Thomas, Allison Benz, and Cecile Young. On the briefing and argument before us, it appears that these particular defendants fall within the scope of Ex parte Young's historic exception to state sovereign immunity. Each of these individuals is an executive licensing official who may or must take enforcement actions against the petitioners if they violate the terms of Texas's Health and Safety Code, including S. B. 8. See, e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.055(a), Brief for Petitioners 33-34. Accordingly, we hold that sovereign immunity does not bar the petitioners' suit  against these named defendants at the motion to dismiss stage.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,63,"Justice THOMAS alone reaches a different conclusion. He emphasizes that suits seeking equitable relief against executive officials are permissible only when supported by tradition. See post, at 539-540 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). He further emphasizes that the relevant tradition here, embodied in Ex parte Young, permits equitable relief against only those officials who possess authority to enforce a challenged state law. Post, at 540-541. We agree with all of these principles, our disagreement is restricted to their application.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,64,"Justice THOMAS suggests that the licensing-official defendants lack authority to enforce S. B. 8 because that statute says it is to be exclusively enforced through private civil actions notwithstanding any other law. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a). But the same provision of S. B. 8 also states that the law may not be construed to  limit the enforceability of any other laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. § 171.207(b)(3). This saving clause is significant because, as best we can tell from the briefing before us, the licensing-official defendants are charged with enforcing other laws that regulate  abortion. Consider, for example, Texas Occupational Code § 164.055, titled Prohibited Acts Regarding Abortion. That provision states that the Texas Medical Board shall take an appropriate disciplinary action against a physician who violates  Chapter 171, Health and Safety Code, a part of Texas statutory law that includes S. B. 8. Accordingly, it appears Texas law imposes on the licensing-official defendants a duty to enforce a law that regulates or prohibits abortion, a duty expressly preserved by S. B. 8's saving clause. Of course, Texas courts and not this one are the final arbiters of the meaning of state statutory directions. See Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). But at least based on the limited arguments put to us at this stage of the litigation, it appears that the licensing defendants do have authority to enforce S. B. 8.4",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,65,"In the face of this conclusion, Justice THOMAS advances an alternative argument. He stresses that to maintain a suit consistent with this Court's Ex parte Young and Article III precedents, it is not enough that petitioners `feel inhibited' or `chilled' by the abstract possibility of an enforcement action against them. Post, at 542-543. Rather, they must show at least a credible threat of such an action against them. Post, at 542-543. Again, we agree with these observations in principle and disagree only on their application to the facts of this case. The petitioners  have plausibly alleged that S. B. 8 has already had a direct effect on their day-to-day operations. See Complaint ¶¶ 103, 106-109. And they have identified provisions of state law that appear to impose a duty on the licensing-official defendants to bring disciplinary actions against them if they violate S. B. 8. In our judgment, this is enough at the motion to dismiss stage to suggest the petitioners will be the target of an enforcement action and thus allow this suit to proceed.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,67,"While this interlocutory appeal focuses primarily on the Texas official defendants' motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity and justiciability, before we granted certiorari the Fifth Circuit also agreed to take up an appeal by the sole private defendant, Mr. Dickson. In the briefing before us, no one contests this decision. In his appeal, Mr. Dickson argues that the petitioners lack standing to sue him because he possesses no intention to file an S. B. 8 suit against them. Mr. Dickson has supplied sworn declarations so attesting. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent Dickson 32. The petitioners do not contest this testimony or ask us to disregard it. Accordingly, on the record before us the petitioners cannot establish personal injury fairly traceable to Mr. Dickson's allegedly unlawful conduct. California v. Texas, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2116 (internal quotation marks omitted). No Member of the Court disagrees with this resolution of the claims against Mr. Dickson.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,69,"While this should be enough to resolve the petitioners' appeal, a detour is required before we close. Justice SOTOMAYOR charges this Court with shrinking from the task of defending the supremacy of the Federal Constitution over state law. Post, at 550. That rhetoric bears no relation to reality.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,70,"The truth is, many paths exist to vindicate the supremacy of federal law in this area. Even aside from the fact that eight Members of the Court agree sovereign immunity does not bar the petitioners from bringing this pre-enforcement challenge in federal court, everyone acknowledges that other pre-enforcement challenges may be possible in state court as well.5 In fact, 14 such state-court cases already seek to vindicate both federal and state constitutional claims against S. B. 8—and they have met with some success at the summary judgment stage. See supra, at 530. Separately, any individual sued under S. B. 8 may pursue state and federal constitutional arguments in his or her defense. See n. 1, supra. Still further viable avenues to contest the law's compliance with the Federal Constitution also may be possible, we do not prejudge the possibility. Given all this, Justice SOTOMAYOR's suggestion that the Court's ruling somehow clears the way for the nullification of federal law along the lines of what happened in the Jim Crow South not only wildly mischaracterizes the impact of today's decision, it cheapens the gravity of past wrongs. Post, at 550-551.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,71,"The truth is, too, that unlike the petitioners before us, those seeking to challenge the constitutionality of state laws are not always able to pick and choose the timing and preferred forum for their arguments. This Court has never recognized an  unqualified right to pre-enforcement review of constitutional claims in federal court. In fact, general federal question jurisdiction did not even exist for much of this Nation's history. See Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, 376, 132 S.Ct. 740, 181 L.Ed.2d 881 (2012). And pre-enforcement review under the statutory regime the petitioners invoke, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, was not prominent until the mid-20th century. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 180, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), see also R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 994 (7th ed. 2015). To this day, many federal constitutional rights are as a practical matter asserted typically as defenses to state-law claims, not in federal pre-enforcement cases like this one. See, e.g., Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011) (First Amendment used as a defense to a state tort suit).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,72,"Finally, Justice SOTOMAYOR contends that S. B. 8 chills the exercise of federal constitutional rights. If nothing else, she says, this fact warrants allowing further relief in this case. Post, at 545-546, 548-549. Here again, however, it turns out that the Court has already and often confronted—and rejected—this very line of thinking. As our cases explain, the chilling effect associated with a potentially unconstitutional law being `on the books' is insufficient to justify federal intervention in a pre-enforcement suit. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 42, 50-51, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Instead, this Court has always required proof of a more concrete injury and compliance with traditional rules of equitable practice. See Muskrat, 219 U.S. at 361, 31 S.Ct. 250, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441. The Court has consistently applied these requirements whether the challenged law in question is said to chill the free exercise of religion, the freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, or any other right. The petitioners are not entitled to a special exemption.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,73,"Maybe so, Justice SOTOMAYOR replies, but what if other States pass legislation similar to S. B. 8? Doesn't that possibility justify throwing aside our traditional rules? Post, at 550. It does not. If other States pass similar legislation, pre-enforcement challenges like the one the Court approves today may be available in federal court to test the constitutionality of those laws. Again, too, further pre-enforcement challenges may be permissible in state court and federal law may be asserted as a defense in any enforcement action. To the extent Justice SOTOMAYOR seems to wish even more tools existed to combat this type of law, Congress is free to provide them. In fact, the House of Representatives recently passed a statute that would purport to preempt state laws like S. B. 8. See H. R. 3755, 117th Cong., 1st Sess. (2021). But one thing this Court may never do is disregard the traditional limits on the jurisdiction of federal courts just to see a favored result win the day. At the end of that road is a world in which the division of power among the branches of Government could exist no longer, and the other departments would be swallowed up by the judiciary. 4 Papers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984).6",Gorsuch,0,
2021-033,75,"The petitioners' theories for relief face serious challenges but also present some  opportunities. To summarize: (1) The Court unanimously rejects the petitioners' theory for relief against state-court judges and agrees Judge Jackson should be dismissed from this suit. (2) A majority reaches the same conclusion with respect to the petitioners' parallel theory for relief against state-court clerks. (3) With respect to the back-up theory of relief the petitioners present against Attorney General Paxton, a majority concludes that he must be dismissed. (4) At the same time, eight Justices hold this case may proceed past the motion to dismiss stage against Mr. Carlton, Ms. Thomas, Ms. Benz, and Ms. Young, defendants with specific disciplinary authority over medical licensees, including the petitioners.

Such a right would stand in significant tension with the longstanding Article III principle that federal courts generally may not give advisory rulings on the potential success of an affirmative defense before a cause of action has even accrued. MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 142, 127 S.Ct. 764, 166 L.Ed.2d 604 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), see also Coffman v.

2021-033,81,"That said, a party subject to imminent threat of state enforcement proceedings  may seek a kind of pre-enforcement review in the form of a negative injunction. This procedural device permits a party to assert in equity  a defense that would otherwise have been available in the State's enforcement proceedings at law. Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 262, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011) (KENNEDY, J., concurring), accord, Douglas v.

In Ex parte Young, this Court recognized that use of this negative injunction against a governmental defendant provides a narrow exception to sovereign immunity. See 209 U.S. at 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441. That exception extends no further than permitting private parties in some circumstances to prevent state officials from bringing an action to enforce a state law that is contrary to federal law.",Thomas,0,

Rev. 989, 990 (2008), that federal courts have authority to entertain under their traditional equitable jurisdiction, see Judiciary Act of 1789, § 11, 1 Stat. 78.

2021-033,83,"The principal opinion agrees with all of these principles. Ante, at 536. I part ways with the principal opinion only in its conclusion that the four licensing-official respondents are appropriate defendants under Ex parte Young. For at least two reasons, they are not.",Thomas,0,
2021-033,84,"First, an Ex parte Young defendant must have some connection with the enforcement of the act—i.e., the right and the power to enforce the act alleged to be unconstitutional. 209 U.S. at 157, 161, 28 S.Ct. 441. The only act alleged to be unconstitutional here is S. B. 8. And that statute explicitly denies enforcement authority to any governmental official. On this point, the Act is at least triply clear. The statute begins: Notwithstanding  any other law, the requirements of this subchapter shall be enforced exclusively through  private civil actions. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021) (emphasis added). The Act continues: No enforcement of this subchapter  in response to violations of this subchapter, may be taken or threatened by this state  or an executive or administrative officer or employee of this state. Ibid. Later on, S. B. 8 reiterates: Any person, other than an officer or employee of a state or local governmental entity in this state, may bring a civil action. § 171.208(a) (emphasis added). In short, the Act repeatedly confirms that respondent licensing officials, like any other governmental officials, have no duty at all with regard to the act, and therefore cannot be properly made parties  to the suit. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 158, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Thomas,0,
2021-033,85,"The principal opinion does not dispute the meaning of these provisions. Instead, it finds residual enforcement authority for the licensing officials elsewhere in S. B. 8. In its saving clause, the Act provides that no court may construe S. B. 8 as limiting the enforceability of any other laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. § 171.207(b)(3). If one of these other laws permits a governmental official to enforce S. B. 8, the principal opinion reasons, the saving clause preserves that enforcement authority. The principal opinion then proposes that the Texas Medical Board may enforce S. B. 8 under § 164.055 of the Texas Occupations Code. Thus, on that view, S. B. 8 permits the Medical Board to discipline physicians for violating the statute despite the Act's command that the requirements of this subchapter shall be enforced exclusively through  private civil actions, notwithstanding  any other law. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a) (emphasis added).",Thomas,0,
2021-033,86,"Rather than introduce competing instructions in S. B. 8, I would read the Act as a `harmonious whole.' Roberts v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., 566 U.S. 93, 100, 132 S.Ct. 1350, 182 L.Ed.2d 341 (2012). By its terms, S. B. 8's saving clause preserves enforcement only of laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. § 171.207(b)(3) (emphasis added). Such laws include, for example, restrictions on late-term or partial-birth abortions. See §§ 171.044, 174.102. Section 164.055 of the Texas Occupations Code, by contrast, does not regulate or prohibit abortion. As the principal opinion explains, that provision merely grants authority to the Texas Medical Board to enforce other laws that do regulate abortion. See Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.055 (West 2012). Thus, the saving clause does not apply, and S. B. 8 explicitly forecloses enforcement of its requirements by the Texas Medical Board.2",Thomas,0,
2021-033,87,"The principal opinion contends that the Act confirms its understanding by explicitly proscribing criminal prosecution. Ante, at 536, n. 3 (citing Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a)). By withholding criminal enforcement authority, the principal opinion argues, S. B. 8 tacitly leaves at least some civil enforcement authority in place. But the force of any negative implication  depends on context. Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 381, 133 S.Ct. 1166, 185 L.Ed.2d 242 (2013). A statute may indicate that adopting a particular rule  was probably not meant to signal any exclusion. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-033,88,"That is the case here. Again, S. B. 8 repeatedly bars governmental enforcement. See supra, at 540-541. That Texas identified a specific example of withheld enforcement authority alongside the Act's general proscription is not inconsistent with the conclusion that S. B. 8 sweeps as broadly as its language suggests. Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 226-227, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). Texas may have simply intended to remove any doubt that criminal prosecution is unavailable under S. B. 8. Id., at  226, 128 S.Ct. 831, see also Yellen v. Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Reservation, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2434, 2460, 210 L.Ed.2d 517 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (illustrative examples can help orient affected parties and courts to Congress's thinking). It is unsurprising that Texas repeated itself to make its point doubly sure. Barton v. Barr, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1442, 1453, 206 L.Ed.2d 682 (2020).

2021-033,90,"Rather, petitioners complain of the chill S. B. 8 has on the purported right to abortion. But as our cases make clear, it is not enough that petitioners feel inhibited because S.

Boise Artesian, 213 U.S. at 285, 29 S.Ct. 426. To sustain suit against the licensing officials, whether under Article III or Ex parte Young, petitioners must show at least a credible and specific threat of enforcement to rescind their medical licenses or assess some other penalty under S. B. 8. See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014). Petitioners offer nothing to make this showing.

2021-033,91,"The irony of this case is that S. B. 8 has generated more litigation against those who oppose abortion than those who perform it.

Opponents of abortion, meanwhile, have been sued 14 times in the Texas state courts, including by some of the very petitioners in this case. See Brief for Respondent Clarkston 10.4 Petitioners cast aspersions on the Texas state courts, but those courts are not dawdling in these pre-enforcement actions.

But by design, the mere threat of even unsuccessful suits brought under S. B. 8 chills constitutionally protected conduct, given the peculiar rules that the State has imposed. Under these circumstances, the court clerks who issue citations and docket S. B. 8 cases are unavoidably enlisted in the scheme to enforce S. B. 8's unconstitutional provisions, and thus are sufficiently connected to such enforcement to be proper defendants. Young, 209 U.S. at 157, 28 S.Ct. 441. The role that clerks play with respect to S. B. 8 is distinct from that of the judges. Judges are in no sense adverse to the parties subject to the burdens of S. B. 8. But as a practical matter clerks are—to the extent they set in motion the machinery that imposes these burdens on those sued under S. B. 8. Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337, 338, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969).",Roberts,0,
2021-033,100,"The majority contends that this conclusion cannot be reconciled with Young, pointing to language in Young that suggests it would be improper to enjoin courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases. Ante, at 542-543, Young, 209 U.S. at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441. Decisions after Young, however, recognize that suits to enjoin state court proceedings may be proper. See Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972), see also Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 525, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984). And this conclusion is consistent with the entire thrust of Young itself. Just as in Young, those sued under S. B. 8 will be harassed  with a multiplicity of suits or litigation generally in an endeavor to enforce penalties under an unconstitutional enactment. 209 U.S. at 160, 28 S.Ct. 441. Under these circumstances, where the mere commencement of a suit, and in  fact just the threat of it, is the actionable injury to another, the principles underlying Young authorize relief against the court officials who play an essential role in that scheme. Id., at 153, 28 S.Ct. 441. Any novelty in this remedy is a direct result of the novelty of Texas's scheme.2* * *",Roberts,0,
2021-033,101,"The clear purpose and actual effect of S. B. 8 has been to nullify this Court's rulings. It is, however, a basic principle that the Constitution is the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Indeed, if the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery. United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. 115, 5 Cranch 115, 136, 3 L.Ed. 53 (1809). The nature of the federal right infringed does not matter, it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake.",Roberts,0,

2021-033,103,"For nearly three months, the Texas Legislature has substantially suspended a constitutional guarantee: a pregnant woman's right to control her own body. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). In open defiance of this Court's precedents, Texas enacted Senate Bill 8 (S. B. 8), which bans abortion starting approximately six weeks after a woman's last menstrual period, well before the point of fetal viability. Since S. B. 8 went into effect on September 1, 2021, the law has threatened abortion care providers with the prospect of essentially unlimited suits for damages, brought anywhere in Texas by private bounty hunters, for taking any action to assist women in exercising their constitutional right to choose. The chilling effect has been near total, depriving pregnant women in Texas of virtually all opportunity to seek abortion care within their home State after their sixth week of pregnancy. Some women have vindicated their rights by traveling out of State. For the many women who are unable to do so, their only alternatives are to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or attempt self-induced abortions outside of the medical system.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,104,"The Court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before S. B. 8 first went into effect. It failed to do so then, and it fails again today. I concur in the Court's judgment that the petitioners' suit may proceed against certain executive licensing officials who retain enforcement authority under Texas law, and I trust the District Court will act expeditiously to enter much-needed relief. I dissent, however, from the Court's dangerous departure from its precedents, which establish that federal courts can and should issue relief when a State enacts a law that chills the exercise of a constitutional right and aims to evade judicial review. By foreclosing suit against state-court officials and the state attorney general, the Court effectively  invites other States to refine S. B. 8's model for nullifying federal rights. The Court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,106,"I have previously described the havoc S. B. 8's unconstitutional scheme has wrought for Texas women seeking abortion care and their medical providers.1 I do not repeat those details here, but I briefly out-line the law's numerous procedural and substantive anomalies, most of which the Court simply ignores.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,107,"S. B. 8 authorizes any person—who need not have any relationship to the woman, doctor, or procedure at issue—to sue, for at least $10,000 in damages, anyone who performs, induces, assists, or even intends to assist an abortion in violation of Texas' unconstitutional 6-week ban. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.208(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021). Those vulnerable to suit might include a medical provider, a receptionist, a friend who books an appointment, or a ride-share driver who takes a woman to a clinic.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,108,"Importantly, S. B. 8 also modifies state-court procedures to make litigation uniquely punitive for those sued. It allows defendants to be haled into court in any county in which a plaintiff lives, even if that county has no relationship to the defendants or the abortion procedure at issue. § 171.210(a)(4). It gives the plaintiff a veto over any venue transfer, regardless of the inconvenience to the defendants. § 171.210(b). It prohibits defendants from invoking nonmutual issue or claim preclusion, meaning that if they prevail, they remain vulnerable to suit by any other plaintiff anywhere in the State for the same conduct. § 171.208(e)(5). It also bars defendants from relying on any nonbinding court decision, such as persuasive precedent from other trial courts. § 171.208(e)(4). Although it guarantees attorney's fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs, § 171.208(b)(3), it categorically denies them to prevailing defendants, § 171.208(i), so they must finance their own defenses no matter how frivolous the suits. These provisions are considerable departures from the norm in Texas courts and in most courts across the Nation.2",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,109,"S. B. 8 further purports to limit the substantive defenses that defendants may raise. It permits what it calls an undue burden defense, but redefines that standard to be a shell of what the Constitution requires: Rather than considering the law's cumulative effect on abortion access, see Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 609-624, 136 S.Ct. 2292, 195 L.Ed.2d 665 (2016), it instructs state  courts to focus narrowly on the effect on the parties, §§ 171.209(b)(2), (d)(2). It further purports to impose retroactive liability for abortion care provided while the law is enjoined if the injunction is later overturned on appeal, § 171.208(e)(3), as well as for abortion care provided while Roe and Casey are in effect if this Court later overrules one of those cases, § 171.209(e).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,110,"As a whole, these provisions go beyond imposing liability on the exercise of a constitutional right. If enforced, they prevent providers from seeking effective pre-enforcement relief (in both state and federal court) while simultaneously depriving them of effective post-enforcement adjudication, potentially violating procedural due process. To be sure, state courts cannot restrict constitutional rights or defenses that our precedents recognize, nor impose retroactive liability for constitutionally protected conduct. Such actions would violate a state officer's oath to the Constitution. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 3. Unenforceable though S. B. 8 may be, however, the threat of its punitive measures creates a chilling effect that advances the State's unconstitutional goals.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,112,"This Court has confronted State attempts to evade federal constitutional commands before, including schemes that forced parties to expose themselves to catastrophic liability as state-court defendants in order to assert their rights. Until today, the Court had proven equal to those challenges.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,113,"In 1908, this Court decided Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714. In Young, the Court considered a Minnesota law fixing new rates for railroads and adopting high fines and penalties for failure to comply with the rates. Id., at 128-129, 131, 28 S.Ct. 441. The law purported to provide no option to challenge the new rates other than disobeying the law and taking the risk  of being subjected to such enormous penalties. Id., at 145, 28 S.Ct. 441. Because the railroad officers and employees could not be expected to disobey any of the provisions  at the risk of such fines and penalties, the law effectively resulted in a denial of any hearing to the company. Id., at 146, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,114,"The Court unequivocally rejected this design. Concluding that the legislature could not preclude a resort to the courts for the purpose of testing the law's validity, the Court decided the companies could obtain pre-enforcement relief by suing the Minnesota attorney general based on his connection with the enforcement of the challenged act. Id., at 146, 157, 28 S.Ct. 441. The Court so held despite the fact that the attorney general's only such connection was the general duty imposed upon him, which includes the right and the power to enforce the statutes of the State, including, of course, the act in question. Id., at 161, 28 S.Ct. 441. Over the years, the Young doctrine has been accepted as necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights and hold state officials responsible to the supreme authority of the United States.' Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 105, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (quoting Young, 209 U.S. at 160, 28 S.Ct. 441), accord, e.g., Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 254-255, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,115,"Like the stockholders in Young, abortion providers face calamitous liability from a facially unconstitutional law. To be clear, the threat is not just the possibility of money judgments, it is also that, win or lose, providers may be forced to defend themselves against countless suits, all across the State, without any prospect of  recovery for their losses or expenses. Here, as in Young, the practical effect of these coercive penalties for noncompliance is to foreclose all access to the courts, a constitutionally intolerable choice. Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 218, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994). It would be an injury to a complainant to harass it with a multiplicity of suits or litigation generally in an endeavor to enforce penalties under an unconstitutional enactment, and to prevent it ought to be within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. Young, 209 U.S. at 160, 28 S.Ct. 441. In fact, the circumstances at hand present an even stronger need for pre-enforcement relief than in Young, given how S. B. 8 not only threatens a multiplicity of suits, but also turns state-court procedures against providers to ensure they cannot effectively defend their rights in a suit.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,116,"Under normal circumstances, providers might be able to assert their rights defensively in state court. See ante, at 537-538. These are not normal circumstances. S. B. 8 is structured to thwart review and result in a denial of any hearing. Young, 209 U.S. at 146, 28 S.Ct. 441. To that end, the law not only disclaims direct enforcement by state officials to frustrate pre-enforcement review, but also skews state-court procedures and defenses to frustrate post-enforcement review. The events of the last three months have shown that the law has succeeded in its endeavor. That is precisely what the Court in Young sought to avoid. It is therefore inaccurate to characterize the foregoing analysis as advocating an unqualified right to pre-enforcement review of constitutional claims in federal court. Ante, at 537-538. If that were so, the same charge could be leveled against the Court's decision in Young.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,117,"In addition, state-court clerks are proper defendants in this action. This Court has long recognized that the action of state courts and judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 14, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). In Shelley, private litigants sought to enforce restrictive racial covenants designed to preclude Black Americans from home ownership and to preserve residential segregation. The Court explained that these ostensibly private covenants involved state action because but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported by the full panoply of state power, the covenants would be unenforceable. Id., at 19, 68 S.Ct. 836. Here, there is more. S. B. 8's formidable chilling effect, even before suit, would be nonexistent if not for the state-court officials who docket S. B. 8 cases with lopsided procedures and limited defenses. Because these state actors are necessary components of that chilling effect and play a clear role in the enforcement of S. B. 8, they are proper defendants.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,118,"These longstanding precedents establish how, and why, the Court should authorize relief against these officials as well. The Court instead hides behind a wooden reading of Young, stitching out-of-context quotations into a cover for its failure to act decisively. The Court relies on dicta in Young stating that the right to enjoin an individual  does not include the power to restrain a court from acting in any case brought before it and that an injunction against a state court would be a violation of the whole scheme of our Government. 209 U.S. at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441. Modern cases, however, have recognized that suit may be proper even against state-court judges, including to enjoin state-court proceedings. See Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972), see also Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 525, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984). The Court responds that these  cases did not expressly address sovereign immunity or involve court clerks. Ante, at 533-534. If language in Young posed an absolute bar to injunctive relief against state-court proceedings and officials, however, these decisions would have been purely advisory.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,119,"Moreover, the Court has emphasized that the principles undergirding the Ex parte Young doctrine may support its application to new circumstances, novelty notwithstanding. Stewart, 563 U.S. at 261, 131 S.Ct. 1632. No party has identified any prior circumstance in which a State has delegated an enforcement function to the populace, disclaimed official enforcement authority, and skewed state-court procedures to chill the exercise of constitutional rights. Because S. B. 8's architects designed this scheme to evade Young as historically applied, it is especially perverse for the Court to shield it from scrutiny based on its novelty.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,120,"Next, the Court claims that Young cannot apply because state-court clerks are not adverse to the petitioners. Ante, at 531-532. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, however, ante, at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), the Texas Legislature has ensured that docketing S. B. 8 cases is anything but a neutral action. With S. B. 8's extreme alterations to court procedure and substantive defenses, the Texas court system no longer resembles a neutral forum for the adjudication of rights, S. B. 8 refashions that system into a weapon and points it directly at the petitioners. Under these circumstances, the parties are sufficiently adverse.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,121,"Finally, the Court raises the question of remedy. Ante, at 532. For the Court, that question cascades into many others about the precise contours of an injunction against Texas court clerks in light of state procedural rules. Ante, at 532-533. Vexing though the Court may find these fact-intensive questions, they are exactly the sort of tailoring work that District Courts perform every day. The Court should have afforded the District Court an opportunity to craft appropriate relief before throwing up its hands and declaring the task unworkable. For today's purposes, the answer is simple: If, as our precedents make clear (and as the question presented presumes), S. B. 8 is unconstitutional, contrary state rules of civil procedure must give way. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2 (This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof  shall be the supreme Law of the Land).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,122,"In the midst of its handwringing over remedy, the Court also complains that the petitioners offer no meaningful limiting principles for their theory. Ante, at 532. That is incorrect. The petitioners explain: Where, as here, a State law (1) deliberately seeks to evade federal judicial review by outsourcing enforcement of the law to private individuals without any personal stake, while forbidding state executive officials from direct enforcement, and (2) creates special rules for state-court adjudication to maximize harassment and make timely and effective protection of constitutional  rights impossible, federal relief against clerks is warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioners 6. The petitioners do not argue that pre-enforcement relief against state-court clerks should be available absent those two unique circumstances, and indeed, those circumstances are why the petitioners are threatened with a multiplicity of suits and face a constitutionally intolerable choice under Young.4",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,124,"My disagreement with the Court runs far deeper than a quibble over how many defendants these petitioners may sue. The dispute is over whether States may nullify federal constitutional rights by employing schemes like the one at hand. The Court indicates that they can, so long as they write their laws to more thoroughly disclaim all enforcement by state officials, including licensing officials. This choice to shrink from Texas' challenge to federal supremacy will have far-reaching repercussions. I doubt the Court, let alone the country, is prepared for them.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,125,"The State's concessions at oral argument laid bare the sweeping consequences of its position. In response to questioning, counsel for the State conceded that pre-enforcement review would be unavailable even if a statute imposed a bounty of $1,000,000 or higher. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-53. Counsel further admitted that no individual constitutional right was safe from attack under a similar scheme. Tr. of Oral Arg. in United States v. Texas, No. 21-588, pp. 59-61, 64-65. Counsel even asserted that a State could further rig procedures by abrogating a state supreme court's power to bind its own lower courts. Id., at 78-79. Counsel maintained that even if a State neutered appellate courts' power in such an extreme manner, aggrieved parties' only path to a federal forum would be to violate the unconstitutional law, accede to infringement of their substantive and procedural rights all the way through the state supreme court, and then, at last, ask this Court to grant discretionary certiorari review. Ibid. All of these burdens would layer atop S. B. 8's existing manipulation of state-court procedures and defenses.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,126,"This is a brazen challenge to our federal structure. It echoes the philosophy of John C. Calhoun, a virulent defender of the slaveholding South who insisted that States had the right to veto or nullify any federal law with which they disagreed. Address of J. Calhoun, Speeches of John C. Calhoun 17-43 (1843). Lest the parallel be lost on the Court, analogous sentiments were expressed in this case's companion:  The Supreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution are not the Constitution itself—they are, after all, called opinions. Reply Brief for Intervenors in No. 21-50949 (CA5), p. 4.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,127,"The Nation fought a Civil War over that proposition, but Calhoun's theories were not extinguished. They experienced a revival in the post-war South, and the violence that ensued led Congress to enact Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Proponents of the legislation noted that state courts were being used to harass and injure individuals, either because the state courts were powerless to stop deprivations or were in league with those who were bent upon abrogation of federally protected rights. Mitchum, 407 U.S. at 240, 92 S.Ct. 2151. Thus, § 1983's very purpose, consonant with the values that motivated the Young Court some decades later, was to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law, `whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial.' Mitchum, 407 U.S. at 242, 92 S.Ct. 2151 (quoting Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880)).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,128,"S. B. 8 raises another challenge to federal supremacy, and by blessing significant portions of the law's effort to evade review, the Court comes far short of meeting the moment. The Court's delay in allowing this case to proceed has had catastrophic consequences for women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion in Texas. These consequences have only rewarded the State's effort at nullification. Worse, by foreclosing suit against state-court officials and the state attorney general, the Court clears the way for States to reprise and perfect Texas' scheme in the future to target the exercise of any right recognized by this Court with which they disagree.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,129,"This is no hypothetical. New permutations of S. B. 8 are coming. In the months since this Court failed to enjoin the law, legislators in several States have discussed or introduced legislation that replicates its scheme to target locally disfavored rights.5 What are federal courts to do if, for example, a State effectively prohibits worship by a disfavored religious minority through crushing private litigation burdens amplified by skewed court procedures, but does a better job than Texas of disclaiming all enforcement by state officials? Perhaps nothing at all, says this Court.6 Although some path to relief not recognized today may yet exist, the Court has now foreclosed the most straightforward route under its precedents. I fear the Court, and the country, will come to regret that choice.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2021-033,130,"In its finest moments, this Court has ensured that constitutional rights can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers, nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes  whether  attempted `ingeniously or ingenuously.' Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 17, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 3 L.Ed.2d 19 (1958) (quoting Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 132, 61 S.Ct. 164, 85 L.Ed. 84 (1940)). Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,33,"The Court granted certiorari before judgment in this case to determine whether, under our precedents, certain abortion  providers can pursue a pre-enforcement challenge to a recently enacted Texas statute. We conclude that such an action is permissible against some of the named defendants but not others.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,35,"Earlier this year Texas passed the Texas Heartbeat Act, 87th Leg., Reg. Sess., also known as S. B. 8. The Act prohibits physicians from knowingly performing or inducing an abortion on a pregnant woman if the physician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child unless a medical emergency prevents compliance. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 171.204(a), 171.205(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021). But the law generally does not allow state officials to bring criminal prosecutions or civil enforcement actions. Instead, S. B. 8 directs enforcement through  private civil actions culminating in injunctions and statutory damages awards against those who perform or assist prohibited abortions. §§ 171.207(a), 171.208(a)(2), (3). The law also provides a defense. Tracking language from Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the statute permits abortion providers to defeat any suit against them by showing, among other things, that holding them liable would place an undue burden on women seeking abortions. §§ 171.209(a)-(b).1",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,36,"After the law's adoption, various abortion providers sought to test its constitutionality. Not wishing to wait for S. B. 8 actions in which they might raise their arguments in defense, they filed their own pre-enforcement lawsuits. In all, they brought 14 such challenges in state court seeking, among other things, a declaration that S. B. 8 is inconsistent with both the Federal and Texas Constitutions. A summary judgment ruling in these now-consolidated cases arrived last night, in which the abortion providers prevailed on certain of their claims. Van Stean v. Texas, No. D-1-GN-21-004179 (Dist. Ct.

The Court took up the application and, in the abbreviated time available for review, concluded that the petitioners' submission failed to identify a basis in existing law sufficient to justify disturbing the Court of Appeals' decision denying injunctive relief. Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2494, 210 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,42,"After that ruling, the petitioners filed a second emergency request. This time they asked the Court to grant certiorari before judgment to resolve the defendants' interlocutory appeals in the first instance, without awaiting the views of the Fifth Circuit. This Court granted the petitioners' request and set the case for expedited briefing and argument. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 415, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,44,"Because this Court granted certiorari before judgment, we effectively stand in the shoes of the Court of Appeals. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 690-692, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice 2-11 (11th ed. 2019). In this case, that means we must review the defendants' appeals challenging the District Court's order denying their motions to dismiss. As with any interlocutory appeal, our review is limited to the particular orders under review and any other ruling inextricably intertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of them. Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). In this preliminary posture, the ultimate merits question—whether S. B. 8 is consistent with the Federal Constitution—is not before the Court. Nor is the wisdom of S. B. 8 as a matter of public policy.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,46,"Turning to the matters that are properly put to us, we begin with the sovereign immunity appeal involving the state-court judge, Austin Jackson, and the state-court clerk, Penny Clarkston. While this lawsuit names only one state-court judge and one state-court clerk as defendants, the petitioners explain that they hope eventually to win certification of a class including all  Texas state-court judges and clerks as defendants. In the end, the petitioners say, they intend to seek an order enjoining all state-court clerks from docketing S. B. 8 cases and all state-court judges from hearing them.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,47,"Almost immediately, however, the petitioners' theory confronts a difficulty. Generally, States are immune from suit under the terms of the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See, e.g., Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). To be sure, in Ex parte Young, this Court recognized a narrow exception grounded in traditional equity practice— one that allows certain private parties to seek judicial orders in federal court preventing state executive officials from enforcing state laws that are contrary to federal law. 209 U.S. 123, 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). But as Ex parte Young explained, this traditional exception does not normally permit federal courts to issue injunctions against state-court judges or clerks. Usually, those individuals do not enforce state laws as executive officials might, instead, they work to resolve disputes between parties. If a state court errs in its rulings, too, the traditional remedy has been some form of appeal, including to this Court, not the entry of an ex ante injunction preventing the state court from hearing cases. As Ex parte Young put it, an injunction against a state court or its machinery would be a violation of the whole scheme of our Government. Id., at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,48,"Nor is that the only problem confronting the petitioners' court-and-clerk theory. Article III of the Constitution affords federal courts the power to resolve only actual controversies arising between adverse litigants. Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 361, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246 (1911). Private parties who seek to bring S. B. 8 suits in state court may be litigants adverse to the petitioners. But the state-court clerks who docket those disputes and the state-court judges who decide them generally are not. Clerks serve to file cases as they arrive, not to participate as adversaries in those disputes. Judges exist to resolve controversies about a law's meaning or its conformance to the Federal and State Constitutions, not to wage battle as contestants in the parties' litigation. As this Court has explained, no case or controversy exists between a judge who adjudicates claims under a statute and a litigant who attacks the constitutionality of the statute. Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 538, n. 18, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,49,"Then there is the question of remedy. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 24 directs state-court clerks to accept complaints and record case numbers. The petitioners have pointed to nothing in Texas law that permits clerks to pass on the substance of the filings they docket—let alone refuse a party's complaint based on an assessment of its merits. Nor does Article III confer on federal judges some amorphous power to supervise the operations of government and reimagine from the ground up the job description of Texas state-court clerks. Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 829, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,50,"Troubling, too, the petitioners have not offered any meaningful limiting principles for their theory. If it caught on and federal judges could enjoin state courts and clerks from entertaining disputes between private parties under this state law, what would stop federal judges from prohibiting state courts and clerks from hearing and docketing disputes between private parties under other state laws? And if the state courts and clerks somehow qualify as adverse litigants for Article III purposes in  the present case, when would they not? The petitioners offer no satisfactory answers.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,51,"Instead, only further questions follow. Under the petitioners' theory, would clerks have to assemble a blacklist of banned claims subject to immediate dismissal? What kind of inquiry would a state court have to apply to satisfy due process before dismissing those suits? How notorious would the alleged constitutional defects of a claim have to be before a state-court clerk would risk legal jeopardy merely for filing it? Would States have to hire independent legal counsel for their clerks—and would those advisers be the next target of suits seeking injunctive relief? When a party hales a state-court clerk into federal court for filing a complaint containing a purportedly unconstitutional claim, how would the clerk defend himself consistent with his ethical obligation of neutrality? See Tex. Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3(B)(10) (2021) (instructing judges and court staff to abstain from taking public positions on pending or impending proceedings). Could federal courts enjoin those who perform other ministerial tasks potentially related to litigation, like the postal carrier who delivers complaints to the courthouse? Many more questions than answers would present themselves if the Court journeyed this way.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,52,"Our colleagues writing separately today supply no answers either. They agree that state-court judges are not proper defendants in this lawsuit because they are in no sense adverse to the parties whose cases they decide. Post, at 544-545 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). At the same time, our colleagues say they would allow this case to proceed against clerks like Ms. Clarkston. See ibid., see also post, at 548 549 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But in doing so they fail to address the many remedial questions their path invites. They neglect to explain how clerks who merely docket S. B. 8 lawsuits can be considered adverse litigants for Article III purposes while the judges they serve cannot. And they fail to reconcile their views with Ex parte Young. THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges, for example, that clerks set in motion the `machinery' of court proceedings. Post, at 544. Yet he disregards Ex parte Young's express teaching against enjoining the machinery of courts. 209 U.S. at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,53,"Justice SOTOMAYOR seems to admit at least part of the problem. She concedes that older wooden authorities like Ex parte Young appear to prohibit suits against state-court clerks. Post, at 548-549. Still, she insists, we should disregard those cases in favor of more modern case law. Ibid. In places, THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion seems to pursue much the same line of argument. See post, at 544-545. But even overlooking all the other problems attending our colleagues' clerks-only theory, the authorities they cite do not begin to do the work attributed to them.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,54,"Most prominently, our colleagues point to Pulliam. But that case had nothing to do with state-court clerks, injunctions against them, or the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Instead, the Court faced only the question whether the suit before it could proceed against a judge consistent with the distinct doctrine of judicial immunity. 466 U.S. at 541-543, 104 S.Ct. 1970. As well, the plaintiff sought an injunction only to prevent the judge from enforcing a rule of her own creation. Id., at 526, 104 S.Ct. 1970. No one asked the Court to prevent the judge from processing the case consistent with state statutory law, let alone undo Ex parte Young's teaching that federal courts lack such power under traditional equitable principles. Tellingly, our colleagues do not read Pulliam to authorize claims against state-court judges in this  case. And given that, it is a mystery how they might invoke the case as authority for claims against (only) state-court clerks, officials Pulliam never discussed.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,55,"If anything, the remainder of our colleagues' cases are even further afield. Mitchum v. Foster did not involve statecourt clerks, but a judge, prosecutor, and sheriff. See 315 F.Supp. 1387, 1388 (ND Fla. 1970) (per curiam). When it came to these individuals, the Court held only that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar suit against them. 407 U.S. 225, 242-243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972). Once more, the Court did not purport to pass judgment on any sovereign immunity defense, let alone suggest any disagreement with Ex parte Young. To the contrary, the Court went out of its way to emphasize that its decision should not be taken as passing on the question whether principles of equity, comity, and federalism might bar the suit. 407 U.S. at 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151. Meanwhile, Shelley v. Kraemer did not even involve a pre-enforcement challenge against any state-official defendant. 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). There, the petitioners simply sought to raise the Constitution as a defense against other private parties seeking to enforce a restrictive covenant, id., at 14, 68 S.Ct. 836, much as the petitioners here would be able to raise the Constitution as a defense in any S. B. 8 enforcement action brought by others against them. Simply put, nothing in any of our colleagues' cases supports their novel suggestion that we should allow a pre-enforcement action for injunctive relief against state-court clerks, all while simultaneously holding the judges they serve immune.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,57,"Perhaps recognizing the problems with their court-and-clerk theory, the petitioners briefly advance an alternative. They say they seek to enjoin the Texas attorney general from enforcing S. B. 8. Such an injunction, the petitioners submit, would also automatically bind any private party who might try to bring an S. B. 8 suit against them. Reply Brief for Petitioners 21. But the petitioners barely develop this back-up theory in their briefing, and it too suffers from some obvious problems.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,58,"Start with perhaps the most straightforward. While Ex parte Young authorizes federal courts to enjoin certain state officials from enforcing state laws, the petitioners do not direct this Court to any enforcement authority the attorney general possesses in connection with S. B. 8 that a federal court might enjoin him from exercising. Maybe the closest the petitioners come is when they point to a state statute that says the attorney general may institute an action for a civil penalty of $1,000 for violations of this subtitle or a rule or order adopted by the Texas Medical Board. Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 165.101 (West 2012). But the qualification this subtitle limits the attorney general's enforcement authority to the Texas Occupational Code, specifically §§ 151.001 through 171.024. By contrast, S. B. 8 is codified in the Texas Health and Safety Code at §§ 171.201-171.212. The Act thus does not fall within this subtitle. Nor have the petitioners identified for us any rule or order adopted by the Texas Medical Board related to S. B. 8 that the attorney general might enforce against them. To be sure, some of our colleagues suggest that the Board might in the future promulgate such a rule and the attorney general might then undertake an enforcement action. Post, at 544 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing 22 Tex. Admin. Code § 190.8(7) (West 2021)). But this is a series of hypotheticals and an argument even the petitioners do not attempt to advance for themselves.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,59,"Even if we could overcome this problem, doing so would only expose another. Supposing the attorney general did have some enforcement authority under S. B. 8, the petitioners have identified nothing that might allow a federal court to parlay that authority, or any defendant's enforcement authority, into an injunction against any and all unnamed private persons who might seek to bring their own S. B. 8 suits. The equitable powers of federal courts are limited by historical practice. Atlas Life Ins. Co. v. W. I. Southern, Inc., 306 U.S. 563, 568, 59 S.Ct. 657, 83 L.Ed. 987 (1939). A court of equity is as much so limited as a court of law. Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.). Consistent with historical practice, a federal court exercising its equitable authority may enjoin named defendants from taking specified unlawful actions. But under traditional equitable principles, no court may lawfully enjoin the world at large, ibid., or purport to enjoin challenged laws themselves, Whole Woman's Health, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2495 (citing California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2115-2116, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021)).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,60,"Our colleagues offer no persuasive reply to this problem. THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not address it. Meanwhile, Justice SOTOMAYOR offers a radical answer, suggesting once more that this Court should cast aside its precedents requiring federal courts to abide by traditional equitable principles. Post, at 549, n. 3. This time, however, Justice SOTOMAYOR does not claim to identify any countervailing authority to support her proposal. Instead, she says, it is justified purely by the fact that the State of Texas in S. B. 8 has delegated its enforcement authority to the world at large. Ibid. But somewhat analogous complaints could be levied against private attorneys general acts, statutes allowing for private rights of action, tort law, federal antitrust law, and even the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In some sense all of these laws delegate the enforcement of public policy to private parties and reward those who bring suits with bounties like exemplary or statutory damages and attorney's fees. Nor does Justice SOTOMAYOR explain where her novel plan to overthrow this Court's precedents and expand the equitable powers of federal courts would stop—or on what theory it might plausibly happen to reach just this case or maybe those exactly like it.2",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,62,"While this Court's precedents foreclose some of the petitioners' claims for relief, others survive. The petitioners also name as defendants Stephen Carlton, Katherine Thomas, Allison Benz, and Cecile Young. On the briefing and argument before us, it appears that these particular defendants fall within the scope of Ex parte Young's historic exception to state sovereign immunity. Each of these individuals is an executive licensing official who may or must take enforcement actions against the petitioners if they violate the terms of Texas's Health and Safety Code, including S. B. 8. See, e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.055(a), Brief for Petitioners 33-34. Accordingly, we hold that sovereign immunity does not bar the petitioners' suit  against these named defendants at the motion to dismiss stage.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,63,"Justice THOMAS alone reaches a different conclusion. He emphasizes that suits seeking equitable relief against executive officials are permissible only when supported by tradition. See post, at 539-540 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). He further emphasizes that the relevant tradition here, embodied in Ex parte Young, permits equitable relief against only those officials who possess authority to enforce a challenged state law. Post, at 540-541. We agree with all of these principles, our disagreement is restricted to their application.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,64,"Justice THOMAS suggests that the licensing-official defendants lack authority to enforce S. B. 8 because that statute says it is to be exclusively enforced through private civil actions notwithstanding any other law. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a). But the same provision of S. B. 8 also states that the law may not be construed to  limit the enforceability of any other laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. § 171.207(b)(3). This saving clause is significant because, as best we can tell from the briefing before us, the licensing-official defendants are charged with enforcing other laws that regulate  abortion. Consider, for example, Texas Occupational Code § 164.055, titled Prohibited Acts Regarding Abortion. That provision states that the Texas Medical Board shall take an appropriate disciplinary action against a physician who violates  Chapter 171, Health and Safety Code, a part of Texas statutory law that includes S. B. 8. Accordingly, it appears Texas law imposes on the licensing-official defendants a duty to enforce a law that regulates or prohibits abortion, a duty expressly preserved by S. B. 8's saving clause. Of course, Texas courts and not this one are the final arbiters of the meaning of state statutory directions. See Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). But at least based on the limited arguments put to us at this stage of the litigation, it appears that the licensing defendants do have authority to enforce S. B. 8.4",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,65,"In the face of this conclusion, Justice THOMAS advances an alternative argument. He stresses that to maintain a suit consistent with this Court's Ex parte Young and Article III precedents, it is not enough that petitioners `feel inhibited' or `chilled' by the abstract possibility of an enforcement action against them. Post, at 542-543. Rather, they must show at least a credible threat of such an action against them. Post, at 542-543. Again, we agree with these observations in principle and disagree only on their application to the facts of this case. The petitioners  have plausibly alleged that S. B. 8 has already had a direct effect on their day-to-day operations. See Complaint ¶¶ 103, 106-109. And they have identified provisions of state law that appear to impose a duty on the licensing-official defendants to bring disciplinary actions against them if they violate S. B. 8. In our judgment, this is enough at the motion to dismiss stage to suggest the petitioners will be the target of an enforcement action and thus allow this suit to proceed.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,67,"While this interlocutory appeal focuses primarily on the Texas official defendants' motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity and justiciability, before we granted certiorari the Fifth Circuit also agreed to take up an appeal by the sole private defendant, Mr. Dickson. In the briefing before us, no one contests this decision. In his appeal, Mr. Dickson argues that the petitioners lack standing to sue him because he possesses no intention to file an S. B. 8 suit against them. Mr. Dickson has supplied sworn declarations so attesting. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent Dickson 32. The petitioners do not contest this testimony or ask us to disregard it. Accordingly, on the record before us the petitioners cannot establish personal injury fairly traceable to Mr. Dickson's allegedly unlawful conduct. California v. Texas, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2116 (internal quotation marks omitted). No Member of the Court disagrees with this resolution of the claims against Mr. Dickson.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,69,"While this should be enough to resolve the petitioners' appeal, a detour is required before we close. Justice SOTOMAYOR charges this Court with shrinking from the task of defending the supremacy of the Federal Constitution over state law. Post, at 550. That rhetoric bears no relation to reality.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,70,"The truth is, many paths exist to vindicate the supremacy of federal law in this area. Even aside from the fact that eight Members of the Court agree sovereign immunity does not bar the petitioners from bringing this pre-enforcement challenge in federal court, everyone acknowledges that other pre-enforcement challenges may be possible in state court as well.5 In fact, 14 such state-court cases already seek to vindicate both federal and state constitutional claims against S. B. 8—and they have met with some success at the summary judgment stage. See supra, at 530. Separately, any individual sued under S. B. 8 may pursue state and federal constitutional arguments in his or her defense. See n. 1, supra. Still further viable avenues to contest the law's compliance with the Federal Constitution also may be possible, we do not prejudge the possibility. Given all this, Justice SOTOMAYOR's suggestion that the Court's ruling somehow clears the way for the nullification of federal law along the lines of what happened in the Jim Crow South not only wildly mischaracterizes the impact of today's decision, it cheapens the gravity of past wrongs. Post, at 550-551.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,71,"The truth is, too, that unlike the petitioners before us, those seeking to challenge the constitutionality of state laws are not always able to pick and choose the timing and preferred forum for their arguments. This Court has never recognized an  unqualified right to pre-enforcement review of constitutional claims in federal court. In fact, general federal question jurisdiction did not even exist for much of this Nation's history. See Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, 376, 132 S.Ct. 740, 181 L.Ed.2d 881 (2012). And pre-enforcement review under the statutory regime the petitioners invoke, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, was not prominent until the mid-20th century. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 180, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), see also R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 994 (7th ed. 2015). To this day, many federal constitutional rights are as a practical matter asserted typically as defenses to state-law claims, not in federal pre-enforcement cases like this one. See, e.g., Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011) (First Amendment used as a defense to a state tort suit).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,72,"Finally, Justice SOTOMAYOR contends that S. B. 8 chills the exercise of federal constitutional rights. If nothing else, she says, this fact warrants allowing further relief in this case. Post, at 545-546, 548-549. Here again, however, it turns out that the Court has already and often confronted—and rejected—this very line of thinking. As our cases explain, the chilling effect associated with a potentially unconstitutional law being `on the books' is insufficient to justify federal intervention in a pre-enforcement suit. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 42, 50-51, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Instead, this Court has always required proof of a more concrete injury and compliance with traditional rules of equitable practice. See Muskrat, 219 U.S. at 361, 31 S.Ct. 250, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441. The Court has consistently applied these requirements whether the challenged law in question is said to chill the free exercise of religion, the freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, or any other right. The petitioners are not entitled to a special exemption.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,73,"Maybe so, Justice SOTOMAYOR replies, but what if other States pass legislation similar to S. B. 8? Doesn't that possibility justify throwing aside our traditional rules? Post, at 550. It does not. If other States pass similar legislation, pre-enforcement challenges like the one the Court approves today may be available in federal court to test the constitutionality of those laws. Again, too, further pre-enforcement challenges may be permissible in state court and federal law may be asserted as a defense in any enforcement action. To the extent Justice SOTOMAYOR seems to wish even more tools existed to combat this type of law, Congress is free to provide them. In fact, the House of Representatives recently passed a statute that would purport to preempt state laws like S. B. 8. See H. R. 3755, 117th Cong., 1st Sess. (2021). But one thing this Court may never do is disregard the traditional limits on the jurisdiction of federal courts just to see a favored result win the day. At the end of that road is a world in which the division of power among the branches of Government could exist no longer, and the other departments would be swallowed up by the judiciary. 4 Papers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984).6",Gorsuch,0,
2021-034,75,"The petitioners' theories for relief face serious challenges but also present some  opportunities. To summarize: (1) The Court unanimously rejects the petitioners' theory for relief against state-court judges and agrees Judge Jackson should be dismissed from this suit. (2) A majority reaches the same conclusion with respect to the petitioners' parallel theory for relief against state-court clerks. (3) With respect to the back-up theory of relief the petitioners present against Attorney General Paxton, a majority concludes that he must be dismissed. (4) At the same time, eight Justices hold this case may proceed past the motion to dismiss stage against Mr. Carlton, Ms. Thomas, Ms. Benz, and Ms. Young, defendants with specific disciplinary authority over medical licensees, including the petitioners.

In Ex parte Young, this Court recognized that use of this negative injunction against a governmental defendant provides a narrow exception to sovereign immunity. See 209 U.S. at 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441. That exception extends no further than permitting private parties in some circumstances to prevent state officials from bringing an action to enforce a state law that is contrary to federal law.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,82,"The negative injunction remedy against state officials countenanced in Ex parte Young is a standard tool of equity, J. Harrison, Ex Parte Young, 60 Stan. L. Rev. 989, 990 (2008), that federal courts have authority to entertain under their traditional equitable jurisdiction, see Judiciary Act of 1789, § 11, 1 Stat. 78. As we have explained elsewhere, a federal court's jurisdiction in equity extends no further than the jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High Court of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and the enactment of the original Judiciary Act. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318, 119 S.Ct. 1961, 144 L.Ed.2d 319 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, a negative injunction must fall within some clear ground of equity jurisdiction. Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, 213 U.S. 276, 285, 29 S.Ct. 426, 53 L.Ed. 796 (1909), see also Missouri v.

Federal courts therefore lack power to create remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence. Grupo Mexican, 527 U.S. at 332, 119 S.Ct. 1961.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,83,"The principal opinion agrees with all of these principles. Ante, at 536. I part ways with the principal opinion only in its conclusion that the four licensing-official respondents are appropriate defendants under Ex parte Young. For at least two reasons, they are not.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,84,"First, an Ex parte Young defendant must have some connection with the enforcement of the act—i.e., the right and the power to enforce the act alleged to be unconstitutional. 209 U.S. at 157, 161, 28 S.Ct. 441. The only act alleged to be unconstitutional here is S. B. 8. And that statute explicitly denies enforcement authority to any governmental official. On this point, the Act is at least triply clear. The statute begins: Notwithstanding  any other law, the requirements of this subchapter shall be enforced exclusively through  private civil actions. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021) (emphasis added). The Act continues: No enforcement of this subchapter  in response to violations of this subchapter, may be taken or threatened by this state  or an executive or administrative officer or employee of this state. Ibid. Later on, S. B. 8 reiterates: Any person, other than an officer or employee of a state or local governmental entity in this state, may bring a civil action. § 171.208(a) (emphasis added). In short, the Act repeatedly confirms that respondent licensing officials, like any other governmental officials, have no duty at all with regard to the act, and therefore cannot be properly made parties  to the suit. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 158, 28 S.Ct. 441.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,85,"The principal opinion does not dispute the meaning of these provisions. Instead, it finds residual enforcement authority for the licensing officials elsewhere in S. B. 8. In its saving clause, the Act provides that no court may construe S. B. 8 as limiting the enforceability of any other laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. § 171.207(b)(3). If one of these other laws permits a governmental official to enforce S. B. 8, the principal opinion reasons, the saving clause preserves that enforcement authority. The principal opinion then proposes that the Texas Medical Board may enforce S. B. 8 under § 164.055 of the Texas Occupations Code. Thus, on that view, S. B. 8 permits the Medical Board to discipline physicians for violating the statute despite the Act's command that the requirements of this subchapter shall be enforced exclusively through  private civil actions, notwithstanding  any other law. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a) (emphasis added).",Thomas,0,
2021-034,86,"Rather than introduce competing instructions in S. B. 8, I would read the Act as a `harmonious whole.' Roberts v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., 566 U.S. 93, 100, 132 S.Ct. 1350, 182 L.Ed.2d 341 (2012). By its terms, S. B. 8's saving clause preserves enforcement only of laws that regulate or prohibit abortion. § 171.207(b)(3) (emphasis added). Such laws include, for example, restrictions on late-term or partial-birth abortions. See §§ 171.044, 174.102. Section 164.055 of the Texas Occupations Code, by contrast, does not regulate or prohibit abortion. As the principal opinion explains, that provision merely grants authority to the Texas Medical Board to enforce other laws that do regulate abortion. See Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.055 (West 2012). Thus, the saving clause does not apply, and S. B. 8 explicitly forecloses enforcement of its requirements by the Texas Medical Board.2",Thomas,0,
2021-034,87,"The principal opinion contends that the Act confirms its understanding by explicitly proscribing criminal prosecution. Ante, at 536, n. 3 (citing Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.207(a)). By withholding criminal enforcement authority, the principal opinion argues, S. B. 8 tacitly leaves at least some civil enforcement authority in place. But the force of any negative implication  depends on context. Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 381, 133 S.Ct. 1166, 185 L.Ed.2d 242 (2013). A statute may indicate that adopting a particular rule  was probably not meant to signal any exclusion. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-034,88,"That is the case here. Again, S. B. 8 repeatedly bars governmental enforcement. See supra, at 540-541. That Texas identified a specific example of withheld enforcement authority alongside the Act's general proscription is not inconsistent with the conclusion that S. B. 8 sweeps as broadly as its language suggests. Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 226-227, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). Texas may have simply intended to remove any doubt that criminal prosecution is unavailable under S. B. 8. Id., at  226, 128 S.Ct. 831, see also Yellen v. Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Reservation, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2434, 2460, 210 L.Ed.2d 517 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (illustrative examples can help orient affected parties and courts to Congress's thinking). It is unsurprising that Texas repeated itself to make its point doubly sure. Barton v. Barr, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1442, 1453, 206 L.Ed.2d 682 (2020). And, in all events, redundancy in one portion of a statute is not a license to rewrite or eviscerate another portion of the statute contrary to its text. Ibid.3",Thomas,0,
2021-034,89,"Second, even when there is an appropriate defendant to sue, a plaintiff may bring an action under Ex parte Young only when the defendant threatens and is about to commence proceedings. 209 U.S. at 156, 28 S.Ct. 441. Our later cases explain that the prospect of state suit must be imminent. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). Here, none of the licensing officials has threatened enforcement proceedings against petitioners because none has authority to bring them. Petitioners do not and cannot dispute this point.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,90,"Rather, petitioners complain of the chill S. B. 8 has on the purported right to abortion. But as our cases make clear, it is not enough that petitioners feel inhibited because S. B. 8 is on the books. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 42, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is a vague allegation of potential enforcement permissible. Boise Artesian, 213 U.S. at 285, 29 S.Ct. 426. To sustain suit against the licensing officials, whether under Article III or Ex parte Young, petitioners must show at least a credible and specific threat of enforcement to rescind their medical licenses or assess some other penalty under S. B. 8. See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014). Petitioners offer nothing to make this showing. Even if the licensing-official respondents had enforcement authority, the chance of them using it is, at present, entirely imaginary and speculative. Younger, 401 U. S., at 42, 91 S.Ct. 746.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,91,"The irony of this case is that S. B. 8 has generated more litigation against those who oppose abortion than those who perform it. Respondent Clarkston, a state-court clerk, reports that only three S. B. 8 complaints have been filed in the State of Texas, none of which has been served. Brief for Respondent Clarkston 9-10. The private litigants brought those actions only after a San Antonio doctor performed a postheartbeat abortion and openly advertised it in the Washington Post. See A. Braid, Why I Violated Texas's Extreme Abortion Ban, Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2021, p. A31, col. 2. Opponents of abortion, meanwhile, have been sued 14 times in the Texas state courts, including by some of the very petitioners in this case. See Brief for Respondent Clarkston 10.4 Petitioners cast aspersions on the Texas state courts, but those courts are not dawdling in these pre-enforcement actions. The Texas courts held summary-judgment hearings on November  10 and entered partial judgment for the abortion providers on December 9. See Van Stean v. Texas, No. D-1-GN-21-004179 (Dist. Ct. Travis Cty., Tex., Dec. 9, 2021). Simply put, S. B. 8's supporters are under greater threat of litigation than its detractors.",Thomas,0,
2021-034,92,"Despite the foregoing, the principal opinion indicates that the prospect of suit by the licensing respondents is imminent. It cites petitioners' complaint, but the only relevant paragraph conclusorily asserts a risk of professional discipline because certain respondents allegedly retain the authority and duty to enforce other statutes and regulations  that could be triggered by a violation of S. B. 8. Complaint ¶ 107. This conclusory statement, paired with a bare `legal conclusion,' cannot survive a motion to dismiss. Ashcroft v.

2021-034,95,"Texas has passed a law banning abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. See S. B. 8, 87th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2021). That law is contrary to this Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). It has had the effect of denying the exercise of what we have held is a right protected under the Federal Constitution.1",Roberts,0,
2021-034,96,"Texas has employed an array of stratagems designed to shield its unconstitutional law from judicial review. To cite just a few, the law authorizes any person, other than a government official, to bring a lawsuit against anyone who aids or abets, or intends to aid or abet, an abortion performed after roughly six weeks, has special preclusion rules that allow multiple lawsuits concerning a single abortion, and contains broad venue provisions that allow lawsuits to be brought in any of Texas's 254 far flung counties, no matter where the abortion took place. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 171.208(a), (e)(5), 171.210 (West Cum. Supp. 2021). The law then provides for minimum liability of $10,000 plus costs and fees, while barring defendants from recovering their own costs and fees if they prevail. §§ 171.208(b), (i). It also purports to impose backward-looking liability should this Court's precedents or an injunction preventing enforcement of the law be overturned. §§ 171.208(e)(2), (3). And it forbids many state officers from directly enforcing it. § 171.207.",Roberts,0,
2021-034,97,"These provisions, among others, effectively chill the provision of abortions in Texas. Texas says that the law also blocks any pre-enforcement judicial review in federal court. On that latter contention, Texas is wrong. As eight Members of the Court agree, see ante, at 535, petitioners may bring a pre-enforcement suit challenging the Texas law in federal court under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), because there exist state executive officials who retain authority to enforce it. See, e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.055(a) (West 2021). Given the ongoing chilling effect of the state law, the District Court should resolve this litigation and enter appropriate relief without delay.",Roberts,0,
2021-034,98,"In my view, several other respondents are also proper defendants. First, under Texas law, the Attorney General maintains authority coextensive with the Texas Medical Board to address violations of S. B. 8. The Attorney General may institute an action for a civil penalty if a physician violates a rule or order of the Board. Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 165.101. The Board's rules—found in the Texas Administrative Code, see 22 Tex. Admin. Code § 160.1(a) (West 2021)—prohibit licensed physicians from violating Texas's Health and Safety Code, which includes S. B. 8. See 22 Tex. Admin. Code § 190.8(7) (the Board shall take appropriate disciplinary action against a physician who violates  Chapter 171, Texas Health and Safety Code), S. B. 8, 87th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2021) (amending Chapter 171 of the Texas Health and Safety Code by adding Subchapter H). Under Texas law, then, the Attorney General maintains authority to take enforcement actions based on violations of S. B. 8. Ante, at 535. He accordingly also falls within the scope of Young's exception to sovereign immunity. Ante, at 534-535.",Roberts,0,
2021-034,99,"The same goes for Penny Clarkston, a court clerk. Court clerks, of course, do not usually enforce a State's laws. Ante, at 541. But by design, the mere threat of even unsuccessful suits brought under S. B. 8 chills constitutionally protected conduct, given the peculiar rules that the State has imposed. Under these circumstances, the court clerks who issue citations and docket S. B. 8 cases are unavoidably enlisted in the scheme to enforce S. B. 8's unconstitutional provisions, and thus are sufficiently connected to such enforcement to be proper defendants. Young, 209 U.S. at 157, 28 S.Ct. 441. The role that clerks play with respect to S. B. 8 is distinct from that of the judges. Judges are in no sense adverse to the parties subject to the burdens of S. B. 8. But as a practical matter clerks are—to the extent they set in motion the machinery that imposes these burdens on those sued under S. B. 8. Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337, 338, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969).",Roberts,0,
2021-034,100,"The majority contends that this conclusion cannot be reconciled with Young, pointing to language in Young that suggests it would be improper to enjoin courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases. Ante, at 542-543, Young, 209 U.S. at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441. Decisions after Young, however, recognize that suits to enjoin state court proceedings may be proper. See Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972), see also Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 525, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984). And this conclusion is consistent with the entire thrust of Young itself. Just as in Young, those sued under S. B. 8 will be harassed  with a multiplicity of suits or litigation generally in an endeavor to enforce penalties under an unconstitutional enactment. 209 U.S. at 160, 28 S.Ct. 441. Under these circumstances, where the mere commencement of a suit, and in  fact just the threat of it, is the actionable injury to another, the principles underlying Young authorize relief against the court officials who play an essential role in that scheme.

2021-034,101,"The clear purpose and actual effect of S. B. 8 has been to nullify this Court's rulings. It is, however, a basic principle that the Constitution is the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). Indeed, if the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery. United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. 115, 5 Cranch 115, 136, 3 L.Ed. 53 (1809). The nature of the federal right infringed does not matter, it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake.",Roberts,0,

2021-034,103,"For nearly three months, the Texas Legislature has substantially suspended a constitutional guarantee: a pregnant woman's right to control her own body. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). In open defiance of this Court's precedents, Texas enacted Senate Bill 8 (S. B. 8), which bans abortion starting approximately six weeks after a woman's last menstrual period, well before the point of fetal viability. Since S. B. 8 went into effect on September 1, 2021, the law has threatened abortion care providers with the prospect of essentially unlimited suits for damages, brought anywhere in Texas by private bounty hunters, for taking any action to assist women in exercising their constitutional right to choose. The chilling effect has been near total, depriving pregnant women in Texas of virtually all opportunity to seek abortion care within their home State after their sixth week of pregnancy. Some women have vindicated their rights by traveling out of State. For the many women who are unable to do so, their only alternatives are to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or attempt self-induced abortions outside of the medical system.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,104,"The Court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before S. B. 8 first went into effect. It failed to do so then, and it fails again today. I concur in the Court's judgment that the petitioners' suit may proceed against certain executive licensing officials who retain enforcement authority under Texas law, and I trust the District Court will act expeditiously to enter much-needed relief. I dissent, however, from the Court's dangerous departure from its precedents, which establish that federal courts can and should issue relief when a State enacts a law that chills the exercise of a constitutional right and aims to evade judicial review. By foreclosing suit against state-court officials and the state attorney general, the Court effectively  invites other States to refine S. B. 8's model for nullifying federal rights. The Court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,106,"I have previously described the havoc S. B. 8's unconstitutional scheme has wrought for Texas women seeking abortion care and their medical providers.1 I do not repeat those details here, but I briefly out-line the law's numerous procedural and substantive anomalies, most of which the Court simply ignores.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,107,"S. B. 8 authorizes any person—who need not have any relationship to the woman, doctor, or procedure at issue—to sue, for at least $10,000 in damages, anyone who performs, induces, assists, or even intends to assist an abortion in violation of Texas' unconstitutional 6-week ban. See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 171.208(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2021). Those vulnerable to suit might include a medical provider, a receptionist, a friend who books an appointment, or a ride-share driver who takes a woman to a clinic.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,108,"Importantly, S. B. 8 also modifies state-court procedures to make litigation uniquely punitive for those sued. It allows defendants to be haled into court in any county in which a plaintiff lives, even if that county has no relationship to the defendants or the abortion procedure at issue. § 171.210(a)(4). It gives the plaintiff a veto over any venue transfer, regardless of the inconvenience to the defendants. § 171.210(b). It prohibits defendants from invoking nonmutual issue or claim preclusion, meaning that if they prevail, they remain vulnerable to suit by any other plaintiff anywhere in the State for the same conduct. § 171.208(e)(5). It also bars defendants from relying on any nonbinding court decision, such as persuasive precedent from other trial courts. § 171.208(e)(4). Although it guarantees attorney's fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs, § 171.208(b)(3), it categorically denies them to prevailing defendants, § 171.208(i), so they must finance their own defenses no matter how frivolous the suits. These provisions are considerable departures from the norm in Texas courts and in most courts across the Nation.2",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,109,"S. B. 8 further purports to limit the substantive defenses that defendants may raise. It permits what it calls an undue burden defense, but redefines that standard to be a shell of what the Constitution requires: Rather than considering the law's cumulative effect on abortion access, see Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 609-624, 136 S.Ct. 2292, 195 L.Ed.2d 665 (2016), it instructs state  courts to focus narrowly on the effect on the parties, §§ 171.209(b)(2), (d)(2). It further purports to impose retroactive liability for abortion care provided while the law is enjoined if the injunction is later overturned on appeal, § 171.208(e)(3), as well as for abortion care provided while Roe and Casey are in effect if this Court later overrules one of those cases, § 171.209(e).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,110,"As a whole, these provisions go beyond imposing liability on the exercise of a constitutional right. If enforced, they prevent providers from seeking effective pre-enforcement relief (in both state and federal court) while simultaneously depriving them of effective post-enforcement adjudication, potentially violating procedural due process. To be sure, state courts cannot restrict constitutional rights or defenses that our precedents recognize, nor impose retroactive liability for constitutionally protected conduct. Such actions would violate a state officer's oath to the Constitution. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 3. Unenforceable though S. B. 8 may be, however, the threat of its punitive measures creates a chilling effect that advances the State's unconstitutional goals.",Sotomayor,0,

The law purported to provide no option to challenge the new rates other than disobeying the law and taking the risk  of being subjected to such enormous penalties. Id., at 145, 28 S.Ct. 441.

2021-034,115,"Like the stockholders in Young, abortion providers face calamitous liability from a facially unconstitutional law. To be clear, the threat is not just the possibility of money judgments, it is also that, win or lose, providers may be forced to defend themselves against countless suits, all across the State, without any prospect of  recovery for their losses or expenses. Here, as in Young, the practical effect of these coercive penalties for noncompliance is to foreclose all access to the courts, a constitutionally intolerable choice. Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 218, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994). It would be an injury to a complainant to harass it with a multiplicity of suits or litigation generally in an endeavor to enforce penalties under an unconstitutional enactment, and to prevent it ought to be within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. Young, 209 U.S. at 160, 28 S.Ct. 441. In fact, the circumstances at hand present an even stronger need for pre-enforcement relief than in Young, given how S. B. 8 not only threatens a multiplicity of suits, but also turns state-court procedures against providers to ensure they cannot effectively defend their rights in a suit.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,116,"Under normal circumstances, providers might be able to assert their rights defensively in state court. See ante, at 537-538. These are not normal circumstances. S. B. 8 is structured to thwart review and result in a denial of any hearing. Young, 209 U.S. at 146, 28 S.Ct. 441. To that end, the law not only disclaims direct enforcement by state officials to frustrate pre-enforcement review, but also skews state-court procedures and defenses to frustrate post-enforcement review. The events of the last three months have shown that the law has succeeded in its endeavor. That is precisely what the Court in Young sought to avoid. It is therefore inaccurate to characterize the foregoing analysis as advocating an unqualified right to pre-enforcement review of constitutional claims in federal court. Ante, at 537-538. If that were so, the same charge could be leveled against the Court's decision in Young.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,117,"In addition, state-court clerks are proper defendants in this action. This Court has long recognized that the action of state courts and judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 14, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948). In Shelley, private litigants sought to enforce restrictive racial covenants designed to preclude Black Americans from home ownership and to preserve residential segregation. The Court explained that these ostensibly private covenants involved state action because but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported by the full panoply of state power, the covenants would be unenforceable. Id., at 19, 68 S.Ct. 836. Here, there is more. S. B. 8's formidable chilling effect, even before suit, would be nonexistent if not for the state-court officials who docket S. B. 8 cases with lopsided procedures and limited defenses. Because these state actors are necessary components of that chilling effect and play a clear role in the enforcement of S. B. 8, they are proper defendants.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,118,"These longstanding precedents establish how, and why, the Court should authorize relief against these officials as well. The Court instead hides behind a wooden reading of Young, stitching out-of-context quotations into a cover for its failure to act decisively. The Court relies on dicta in Young stating that the right to enjoin an individual  does not include the power to restrain a court from acting in any case brought before it and that an injunction against a state court would be a violation of the whole scheme of our Government. 209 U.S. at 163, 28 S.Ct. 441. Modern cases, however, have recognized that suit may be proper even against state-court judges, including to enjoin state-court proceedings. See Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972), see also Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 525, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984). The Court responds that these  cases did not expressly address sovereign immunity or involve court clerks. Ante, at 533-534. If language in Young posed an absolute bar to injunctive relief against state-court proceedings and officials, however, these decisions would have been purely advisory.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,119,"Moreover, the Court has emphasized that the principles undergirding the Ex parte Young doctrine may support its application to new circumstances, novelty notwithstanding. Stewart, 563 U.S. at 261, 131 S.Ct. 1632. No party has identified any prior circumstance in which a State has delegated an enforcement function to the populace, disclaimed official enforcement authority, and skewed state-court procedures to chill the exercise of constitutional rights. Because S. B. 8's architects designed this scheme to evade Young as historically applied, it is especially perverse for the Court to shield it from scrutiny based on its novelty.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,120,"Next, the Court claims that Young cannot apply because state-court clerks are not adverse to the petitioners. Ante, at 531-532. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, however, ante, at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), the Texas Legislature has ensured that docketing S. B. 8 cases is anything but a neutral action. With S. B. 8's extreme alterations to court procedure and substantive defenses, the Texas court system no longer resembles a neutral forum for the adjudication of rights, S. B. 8 refashions that system into a weapon and points it directly at the petitioners. Under these circumstances, the parties are sufficiently adverse.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,121,"Finally, the Court raises the question of remedy. Ante, at 532. For the Court, that question cascades into many others about the precise contours of an injunction against Texas court clerks in light of state procedural rules. Ante, at 532-533. Vexing though the Court may find these fact-intensive questions, they are exactly the sort of tailoring work that District Courts perform every day. The Court should have afforded the District Court an opportunity to craft appropriate relief before throwing up its hands and declaring the task unworkable. For today's purposes, the answer is simple: If, as our precedents make clear (and as the question presented presumes), S. B. 8 is unconstitutional, contrary state rules of civil procedure must give way. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2 (This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof  shall be the supreme Law of the Land).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,122,"In the midst of its handwringing over remedy, the Court also complains that the petitioners offer no meaningful limiting principles for their theory. Ante, at 532. That is incorrect. The petitioners explain: Where, as here, a State law (1) deliberately seeks to evade federal judicial review by outsourcing enforcement of the law to private individuals without any personal stake, while forbidding state executive officials from direct enforcement, and (2) creates special rules for state-court adjudication to maximize harassment and make timely and effective protection of constitutional  rights impossible, federal relief against clerks is warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioners 6. The petitioners do not argue that pre-enforcement relief against state-court clerks should be available absent those two unique circumstances, and indeed, those circumstances are why the petitioners are threatened with a multiplicity of suits and face a constitutionally intolerable choice under Young.4",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,124,"My disagreement with the Court runs far deeper than a quibble over how many defendants these petitioners may sue. The dispute is over whether States may nullify federal constitutional rights by employing schemes like the one at hand. The Court indicates that they can, so long as they write their laws to more thoroughly disclaim all enforcement by state officials, including licensing officials. This choice to shrink from Texas' challenge to federal supremacy will have far-reaching repercussions. I doubt the Court, let alone the country, is prepared for them.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,125,"The State's concessions at oral argument laid bare the sweeping consequences of its position. In response to questioning, counsel for the State conceded that pre-enforcement review would be unavailable even if a statute imposed a bounty of $1,000,000 or higher. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-53. Counsel further admitted that no individual constitutional right was safe from attack under a similar scheme. Tr. of Oral Arg. in United States v. Texas, No. 21-588, pp. 59-61, 64-65. Counsel even asserted that a State could further rig procedures by abrogating a state supreme court's power to bind its own lower courts. Id., at 78-79. Counsel maintained that even if a State neutered appellate courts' power in such an extreme manner, aggrieved parties' only path to a federal forum would be to violate the unconstitutional law, accede to infringement of their substantive and procedural rights all the way through the state supreme court, and then, at last, ask this Court to grant discretionary certiorari review. Ibid. All of these burdens would layer atop S. B. 8's existing manipulation of state-court procedures and defenses.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,126,"This is a brazen challenge to our federal structure. It echoes the philosophy of John C. Calhoun, a virulent defender of the slaveholding South who insisted that States had the right to veto or nullify any federal law with which they disagreed. Address of J. Calhoun, Speeches of John C. Calhoun 17-43 (1843). Lest the parallel be lost on the Court, analogous sentiments were expressed in this case's companion:  The Supreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution are not the Constitution itself—they are, after all, called opinions. Reply Brief for Intervenors in No. 21-50949 (CA5), p. 4.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,127,"The Nation fought a Civil War over that proposition, but Calhoun's theories were not extinguished. They experienced a revival in the post-war South, and the violence that ensued led Congress to enact Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Proponents of the legislation noted that state courts were being used to harass and injure individuals, either because the state courts were powerless to stop deprivations or were in league with those who were bent upon abrogation of federally protected rights. Mitchum, 407 U.S. at 240, 92 S.Ct. 2151. Thus, § 1983's very purpose, consonant with the values that motivated the Young Court some decades later, was to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law, `whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial.' Mitchum, 407 U.S. at 242, 92 S.Ct. 2151 (quoting Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880)).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,128,"S. B. 8 raises another challenge to federal supremacy, and by blessing significant portions of the law's effort to evade review, the Court comes far short of meeting the moment. The Court's delay in allowing this case to proceed has had catastrophic consequences for women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion in Texas. These consequences have only rewarded the State's effort at nullification. Worse, by foreclosing suit against state-court officials and the state attorney general, the Court clears the way for States to reprise and perfect Texas' scheme in the future to target the exercise of any right recognized by this Court with which they disagree.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,129,"This is no hypothetical. New permutations of S. B. 8 are coming. In the months since this Court failed to enjoin the law, legislators in several States have discussed or introduced legislation that replicates its scheme to target locally disfavored rights.5 What are federal courts to do if, for example, a State effectively prohibits worship by a disfavored religious minority through crushing private litigation burdens amplified by skewed court procedures, but does a better job than Texas of disclaiming all enforcement by state officials? Perhaps nothing at all, says this Court.6 Although some path to relief not recognized today may yet exist, the Court has now foreclosed the most straightforward route under its precedents. I fear the Court, and the country, will come to regret that choice.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2021-034,130,"In its finest moments, this Court has ensured that constitutional rights can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers, nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes  whether  attempted `ingeniously or ingenuously.' Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 17, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 3 L.Ed.2d 19 (1958) (quoting Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 132, 61 S.Ct. 164, 85 L.Ed. 84 (1940)). Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-037,27,"The Internal Revenue Service can seize taxpayer property to collect tax debts. Before it does so, however, the taxpayer is typically entitled to a collection due process hearing—a proceeding at which the taxpayer can challenge the levy or offer collection alternatives like payment by installment. That hearing may have a happy (or at least relatively happy) ending from the taxpayer's perspective. But if not, the taxpayer has 30 days to petition the Tax Court for review.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,28,"Boechler, P.C., the petitioner in this case, missed the deadline by one day. According to the Commissioner of the IRS, this tardiness extinguished Boechler's opportunity to seek review of the agency's determination. The Commissioner insists that the deadline is jurisdictional, which means that the Tax Court has no authority to consider late-filed petitions. And even if it is not jurisdictional, the Commissioner argues, the Tax Court lacks the power to accept a tardy filing by applying the doctrine of equitable tolling. We disagree with the Commissioner on both scores.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,30,"Boechler is a law firm in Fargo, North Dakota. In 2015, the IRS notified Boechler of a discrepancy in its tax filings. When Boechler did not respond, the agency assessed an intentional disregard penalty and notified Boechler of its intent to levy— in other words, to seize and sell—Boechler's property to satisfy the penalty. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 6330(a), 6721(a)(2), (e)(2)(A). That got Boechler's attention, and in an effort to prevent the levy, it requested a hearing before the agency's Independent Office of Appeals. § 6330(b). This proceeding —known as a collection due process hearing—generally provides taxpayers with administrative review before the IRS  takes their property. § 6330(a)(1). At its hearing, Boechler challenged the penalty, arguing both that there was no discrepancy in its tax filings and that the penalty was excessive.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,31,"The Independent Office of Appeals sustained the proposed levy. Under § 6330(d)(1), Boechler had 30 days to petition the Tax Court to review this collection due process determination. But Boechler dropped the ball and filed its petition a day late. The Tax Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that § 6330(d)(1)'s 30-day filing deadline is jurisdictional and thus cannot be equitably tolled. 967 F.3d 760 (2020). We granted certiorari. 594 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 55, 210 L.Ed.2d 1023 (2021).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,34,"Jurisdictional requirements mark the bounds of a court's adjudicatory authority. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004). Yet not all procedural requirements fit that bill. Many simply instruct parties to take certain procedural steps at certain specified times without conditioning a court's authority to hear the case on compliance with those steps. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011). These nonjurisdictional rules promote the orderly progress of litigation but do not bear on a court's power. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,35,"The distinction matters. Jurisdictional requirements cannot be waived or forfeited, must be raised by courts sua sponte, and, as relevant to this case, do not allow for equitable exceptions. Id., at 434-435, 131 S.Ct. 1197, Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. 145, 154, 133 S.Ct. 817, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013). Mindful of these consequences, we have endeavored to bring some discipline to use of the jurisdictional label. Henderson, 562 U.S., at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,36,"To that end, we treat a procedural requirement as jurisdictional only if Congress clearly states that it is. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 515, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). Congress need not incant magic words, Auburn, 568 U.S., at 153, 133 S.Ct. 817, but the traditional tools of statutory construction must plainly show that Congress imbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional consequences, United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 410, 135 S.Ct. 1625, 191 L.Ed.2d 533 (2015). This case therefore turns on whether Congress has clearly stated that § 6330(d)(1)'s deadline to petition for review of a collection due process determination is jurisdictional.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,37,Section 6330(d)(1) provides:,Barrett,0,
2021-037,38,"The person may, within 30 days of a determination under this section, petition the Tax Court for review of such determination (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,39,The only jurisdictional language appears in the parenthetical at the end of the sentence. All agree that the parenthetical grants the Tax Court jurisdiction over petitions for review of collection due process determinations. And all agree that the provision imposes a 30-day deadline to file those petitions. The question is whether the provision limits the Tax Court's jurisdiction to petitions filed within that timeframe.,Barrett,0,
2021-037,40,"The answer depends on the meaning of such matter, the phrase marking the bounds of the Tax Court's jurisdiction. Boechler contends that it refers only to the immediately preceding phrase: a petition to the Tax Court for review of such determination.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,41,"If so, the filing deadline is independent of the jurisdictional grant. The Commissioner, by contrast, argues that such matter refers to the entire first clause of the sentence, sweeping in the deadline and granting jurisdiction only over petitions filed within that time. On this reading, the deadline is jurisdictional.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,42,"As we see it, the text does not clearly mandate the jurisdictional reading. It is hard to see how it could, given that such matter lacks a clear antecedent. The word matter does not appear elsewhere in § 6330(d)(1), and no other `noun or noun phrase' serves as the obvious antecedent. A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 144 (2012). Both parties cope with this awkward structure by treating petition as a noun, even though it appears in the provision as a verb. Maybe the parties are right that the statute asks the single word petition to perform double duty. But relying on this grammatical sleight of hand does not exactly help the Commissioner's argument that the text is clear. Moreover, even taking petition as a noun, Boechler's interpretation has a small edge. The last-antecedent rule instructs that the correct antecedent is usually the nearest reasonable one. Ibid. And Boechler links such matter to the phrase immediately preceding the jurisdictional parenthetical, while the Commissioner stretches back one phrase more. This is hardly a slam dunk for Boechler, but it is one reason to prefer its reading—or at least to regard the Commissioner's as not clearly right.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,43,"It is also worth noting that the parties' back-and-forth does not exhaust the universe of plausible ways to read such matter. For example, such matter might refer to such determination (which in turn refers to a determination under this section). Or such matter might refer to the preceding subsection's list of matters that may be considered during the collection due process hearing. 26 U.S.C. § 6330(c). Neither possibility ties the Tax Court's jurisdiction to the filing deadline, and that is another point in Boechler's favor. Where multiple plausible interpretations exist—only one of which is jurisdictional —it is difficult to make the case that the jurisdictional reading is clear. See Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 287, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,44,"Nothing else in the provision's text or structure advances the case for jurisdictional clarity. The deadline, which appears in the first independent clause of the sentence, explains what the taxpayer may do: The person may, within 30 days of a determination under this section, petition the Tax Court for review of such determination. § 6330(d)(1). The jurisdictional grant, which appears in a parenthetical at the end of the sentence, speaks to what the Tax Court shall do: (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter). Ibid. As explained above, this language can be plausibly construed to condition the Tax Court's jurisdiction on a timely filing. But the condition would not be express and would be found in a parenthetical, which is typically used to convey an aside or afterthought. B. Garner, Modern English Usage 1020 (4th ed. 2016).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,45,"Finally, the broader statutory context confirms the lack of any clear statement in § 6330(d)(1). Other tax provisions enacted around the same time as § 6330(d)(1) much more clearly link their jurisdictional grants to a filing deadline. See 26 U.S.C. § 6404(g)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (the Tax Court has jurisdiction over any action  to determine whether the Secretary's failure to abate interest under this section was an abuse of discretion,  if such action is brought within 180 days), § 6015(e)(1)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (The individual may petition the Tax Court (and  the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction) to determine the appropriate relief available to the individual under this section if such petition is filed during the 90-day period). These provisions accentuate the lack of comparable clarity in § 6330(d)(1).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,47,"The Commissioner's counterarguments fall short. To begin with, the Commissioner repeats his refrain that such matter refers to the entire first clause of the sentence, thereby conditioning the Tax Court's jurisdiction on the deadline. We agree that this is a plausible interpretation of the statute. Some might even think it better than Boechler's. But in this context, better is not enough. To satisfy the clear-statement rule, the jurisdictional condition must be just that: clear. And as we have already explained, the Commissioner's interpretation is not.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,48,"What of the fact that the jurisdictional grant and filing deadline appear in the same provision, even the same sentence? This does not render the Commissioner's reading clear either. A requirement does not become jurisdictional simply because it is placed in a section of a statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions. Auburn, 568 U.S., at 155, 133 S.Ct. 817. Consequently, this is not the first time we have parsed a single statutory sentence to distinguish between its jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional elements. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 763-764, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). Rather than proximity, the important feature is the one that is missing here: a clear tie between the deadline and the jurisdictional grant.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,49,"The Commissioner contends that a neighboring provision clarifies the jurisdictional effect of the filing deadline. Section 6330(e)(1) provides that if a collection due process hearing is requested  the levy actions which are the subject of the requested hearing  shall be suspended for the period during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are pending. To enforce that suspension, a proper court, including the Tax Court, may enjoin a levy or proceeding during the time the suspension  is in force, but the Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction under this paragraph to enjoin any action or proceeding unless a timely appeal has been filed under subsection (d)(1). § 6330(e)(1).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,50,"Section 6330(e)(1) thus plainly conditions the Tax Court's jurisdiction to enjoin a levy on a timely filing under § 6330(d)(1). According to the Commissioner, this suggests that § 6330(d)(1)'s filing deadline is also jurisdictional. It would be strange, the Commissioner says, to make the deadline a jurisdictional requirement for a particular remedy (an injunction), but not for the underlying merits proceeding itself. If that were so, the Tax Court could accept late-filed petitions but would lack jurisdiction to enjoin collection in such cases. So if the IRS disobeyed § 6330(e)(1)'s instruction to suspend the levy during the hearing and any appeal, the taxpayer would have to initiate a new proceeding in district court to make the IRS stop.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,51,"We are unmoved—and not only because the scenario the Commissioner posits would arise from the IRS's own recal-citrance. The possibility of dual-track jurisdiction might strengthen the Commissioner's argument that his interpretation is superior to Boechler's. Yet as we have already explained, the Commissioner's interpretation must be not only better, but also clear. And the prospect that § 6330(e)(1) deprives the Tax Court of authority to issue an injunction in a subset of appeals (where a petition for review is both filed late and accepted on equitable tolling grounds) does not carry the Commissioner over that line. If anything,  § 6330(e)(1)'s clear statement—that the Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction  to enjoin any action or proceeding unless a timely appeal has been filed—highlights the lack of such clarity in § 6330(d)(1).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,52,"The Commissioner's weakest argument is his last: He insists that § 6330(d)(1)'s filing deadline is jurisdictional because at the time that deadline was enacted, lower courts had held that an analogous tax provision regarding IRS deficiency determinations is jurisdictional. (That provision says that within 90 days  the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. 26 U.S.C. § 6213(a).) According to the Commissioner, Congress was aware of these lower court cases and expected § 6330(d)(1)'s time limit to have the same effect. So, he says, the statutory backdrop resolves any doubt that might linger in the text.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,53,"The Commissioner's argument misses the mark. The cases he cites almost all predate this Court's effort to bring some discipline to the use of the term jurisdictional. Henderson, 562 U.S., at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197. And while this Court has been willing to treat `a long line of Supreme Court decisions left undisturbed by Congress' as a clear indication that a requirement is jurisdictional, Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1843, 1849, 204 L.Ed.2d 116 (2019), no such long line of authority exists here.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,55,"Of course, the nonjurisdictional nature of the filing deadline does not help Boechler unless the deadline can be equitably tolled. Equitable tolling is a traditional feature of American jurisprudence and a background principle against which Congress drafts limitations periods. Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.S. 1, 10-11, 134 S.Ct. 1224, 188 L.Ed.2d 200 (2014). Because we do not understand Congress to alter that backdrop lightly, nonjurisdictional limitations periods are presumptively subject to equitable tolling. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).1",Barrett,0,
2021-037,56,"We see nothing to rebut the presumption here. Section 6330(d)(1) does not expressly prohibit equitable tolling, and its short, 30-day time limit is directed at the taxpayer, not the court. Cf. id., at 94-96, 111 S.Ct. 453 (holding that a statutory time limit with the same characteristics is subject to equitable tolling). The deadline also appears in a section of the Tax Code that is `unusually protective' of taxpayers and a scheme in which `laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers,' often `initiate the process.' Auburn, 568 U.S., at 160, 133 S.Ct. 817. This context does nothing to rebut the presumption that non-jurisdictional deadlines can be equitably tolled.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,57,"To counter these points, the Commissioner invokes United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997), in which we held equitable tolling inapplicable to § 6511's deadline for taxpayers to file refund claims. Id., at 348, 117 S.Ct. 849. But Brockamp, which rested on several distinctive features of that statutory deadline, is inapposite. Congress wrote the time limit in unusually emphatic form, and its detailed technical language  could not easily be read as containing implicit exceptions. Id., at 350, 117 S.Ct. 849. The statute also reiterated the deadline several times in several different ways. Id., at 351, 117 S.Ct. 849. And the statute explicitly listed numerous (six) exceptions to the deadline. Id., at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. The nature of the underlying subject matter—tax collection —underscored the linguistic point. Ibid.

Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,58,"Section 6330(d)(1)'s deadline is a far cry from the one in Brockamp. This deadline is not written in emphatic form or with detailed and technical language, nor is it reiterated multiple times. The deadline admits of a single exception (as opposed to Brockamp's six), which applies if a taxpayer is prohibited from filing a petition with the Tax Court because of a bankruptcy proceeding. § 6330(d)(2). That makes this case less like Brockamp and more like Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), in which we applied equitable tolling to a deadline with a single statutory exception. See id., at 647-648, 130 S.Ct. 2549. And it bears emphasis that Brockamp does not control simply because it also dealt with a statute relating to tax collection. In this case, any concerns about the administrability of applying equitable tolling to § 6330(d)(1) pale in comparison to those at issue in Brockamp, which dealt with a central provision of tax law. The deadline here serves a far more limited and ancillary role in the tax collection system. If anything, the differences between the statute at issue in Brockamp and this one underscore the reasons why equitable tolling applies to § 6330(d)(1).",Barrett,0,
2021-037,59,"The Commissioner protests that if equitable tolling is available, the IRS will not know whether it can proceed with a collection action after § 6330(d)(1)'s deadline passes. The Commissioner acknowledges that the deadline is already subject to tolling provisions found elsewhere in the Tax Code—for example, tolling is available to taxpayers located in a combat zone or disaster area. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-40. But he says that the IRS can easily account for these contingencies because it continuously monitors whether any taxpayer is in a combat zone or disaster area. Ibid. Tolling the § 6330(d)(1) deadline outside these circumstances, the Commissioner insists, would create much more uncertainty. Id., at 37-38.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,60,"We are not convinced that the possibility of equitable tolling for the relatively small number of petitions at issue in this case will appreciably add to the uncertainty already present in the process. To take the most obvious example, petitions for review are considered filed when mailed. 26 U.S.C. § 7502(a)(1). The 30-day deadline thus may come and go before a petition filed within that time comes to the IRS's attention. Presumably, the IRS does not monitor when petitions for review are mailed. So it is not as if the IRS can confidently rush to seize property on day 31 anyway.",Barrett,0,
2021-037,61,"None of this is to say that Boechler is entitled to equitable tolling on the facts of this case. That should be determined on remand. We simply hold that § 6330(d)(1)'s filing deadline, like most others, can be equitably tolled in appropriate cases.",Barrett,0,

In this case, the plaintiffs brought such a suit to recover expropriated property. The question presented is what choice-of-law rule the court should use to determine the applicable substantive law. The answer is: whatever choice-of-law rule the court would use if the defendant were not a foreign-state actor, but instead a private party. Here, that means applying the forum State's choiceof-law rule, not a rule deriving from federal common law.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,29,"Although the legal issue before us is prosaic, the case's subject matter and background are anything but. At issue is the ownership of an Impressionist painting depicting a Paris streetscape: Camille Pissarro's Rue Saint-Honoré in the Afternoon, Effect of Rain (shown in this opinion's appendix). Pissarro's agent sold the painting in 1900 to Paul Cassirer, a member of a prominent German Jewish family owning an art gallery and publishing house. Some quarter century later, Lilly Cassirer inherited the painting and displayed it in her Berlin home (as also pictured in the appendix). But in 1933, the Nazis came to power. After years of intensifying persecution of German Jews, Lilly decided in 1939 that she had to do anything necessary to escape the country. To obtain an exit visa to England, where her grandson Claude Cassirer had already relocated, she surrendered the painting to the Nazis. The underlying question in this case—which this opinion will not resolve— is whether the Cassirer family can get the painting back.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,30,"The post-war search for Rue Saint-Honoré was a long one. Lilly and Claude, who both eventually ended up in the United States, had no success tracking down the painting. After being legally declared the rightful owner, Lilly agreed in 1958 to accept compensation from the German Federal Republic—about $250,000 in today's dollars. (The painting is now thought to be worth tens of millions.) In fact, Rue Saint-Honoré was nearby: Like the Cassirers, the painting had also arrived in the United States after the war, and sat in a private collection in St. Louis from 1952 to 1976. In that year, the Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza (descended from the founder of a German steel empire) purchased the painting and brought it back to Europe. Rue Saint-Honoré hung at his residence in Switzerland until the early 1990s. At that time, the Baron sold much of his art collection, including Rue Saint-Honoré, to an entity the Kingdom of Spain created and controlled, called the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Foundation. In addition to financing the $300 million-plus purchase, the Spanish Government provided the Foundation with a palace in Madrid to serve as a museum for the collection. The museum, as museums do, published a catalogue of its holdings. An acquaintance of Claude's saw the catalogue and made the connection, telling him in 1999 where Rue Saint-Honoré was now located. (Lilly had by then long since died, with Claude as her sole heir.)  After informal efforts to recover the painting failed, Claude sued the Foundation in federal court in the Central District of California, near where he then lived. His complaint asserted various property-law claims, all alleging that he owned Rue Saint-Honoré and was entitled to its return. And because the Foundation is an instrumentality of the Kingdom of Spain, the complaint invoked the FSIA to establish the court's jurisdiction. See § 1603(b) (describing an instrumentality as a legally separate but state-controlled entity). The FSIA governs whether a foreign state or instrumentality is amenable to suit in an American court. It provides the sovereign actor with immunity unless the claim against it falls within a specified exception. See §§ 1605-1607. The complaint here asserted that the statute's expropriation exception applied. That exception removes immunity for cases involving rights in property taken in violation of international law. § 1605(a)(3). At a prior stage of this litigation, the courts below held that the Nazi confiscation of Rue Saint-Honoré brought Claude's suit against the Foundation within the expropriation exception. See 461 F.Supp.2d 1157, 1176-1177 (CD Cal. 2006), aff'd, 616 F.3d 1019, 1037 (CA9 2010) (en banc), cert. denied, 564 U.S. 1037, 131 S.Ct. 3057, 180 L.Ed.2d 886 (2011). That determination, which is no longer at issue, meant that the suit could go forward. (Claude, though, would not live to see anything further, he passed away in 2010, and his heirs became the plaintiffs.)1",Kagan,0,
2021-038,31,"But go forward pursuant to what law? The courts had to decide whose property law (Spain's? California's?) should govern the suit, and thus determine the painting's rightful owner. Resolving that question required application of a choice-of-law rule—a means of selecting which jurisdiction's law governs the determination of liability. Yet there another issue lurked. For the parties contested which choice-of-law rule should apply—serving up, so to speak, a choice of choice-of-law principles. The Cassirer plaintiffs urged the use of California's choice-of-law rule, the defendant Foundation advocated a rule based in federal common law. The courts below, relying on a minimally reasoned Ninth Circuit precedent, picked the federal option. See 153 F.Supp.3d 1148, 1154 (CD Cal. 2015), aff'd, 862 F.3d 951, 961 (CA9 2017), cert. denied, 584 U. S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 1992, 201 L.Ed.2d 270 (2018). That federal choice-of-law rule, they further held, commanded the use of Spanish (not Californian) property law to resolve the ownership issue. See 153 F.Supp.3d at 1155, aff'd, 862 F.3d at 963. Finally, the courts below determined after a trial that under Spanish law the Foundation was the rightful owner, because it purchased Rue Saint-Honoré without knowing the painting was stolen and had held it long enough to gain title through possession. See No. 05-cv-03459 (CD Cal., Apr. 30, 2019), ECF Doc. 621, pp. 26-30, aff'd, 824 Fed.Appx. 452, 454-455 (CA9 2020).",Kagan,0,
2021-038,32,"The Cassirers sought our review, limited to a single issue: whether a court in an FSIA case raising non-federal claims (relating to property, torts, contracts, and so forth) should apply the forum State's choice-of-law rule, or instead use a federal one. We granted certiorari, 594 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 55, 210 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2021), because that question has generated a split in the Courts of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit stands alone in using a federal choice-of-law rule to pick the applicable substantive law. All other Courts of Appeals to  have addressed the issue apply the choice-of-law rule of the forum State.2 We agree with that more common approach, and now vacate the judgment below.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,34,"The FSIA, as indicated above, creates a uniform body of federal law to govern the amenability of foreign states and their instrumentalities to suit in the United States. See supra, at 1507. The statute first lays down a baseline principle of foreign sovereign immunity from civil actions. See § 1604. It then lists a series of exceptions from that principle (including the expropriation exception found to apply here). See §§ 1605-1607, supra, at 1507. The result is to spell out, as a matter of federal law, the suits against foreign sovereigns that American courts do, and do not, have power to decide.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,35,"Yet the FSIA was never intended to affect the substantive law determining the liability of a foreign state or instrumentality deemed amenable to suit. First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 620, 103 S.Ct. 2591, 77 L.Ed.2d 46 (1983). To the contrary, Section 1606 of the statute provides:",Kagan,0,
2021-038,36,"As to any claim for relief with respect to which a foreign state is not entitled to immunity under the FSIA, the foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,37,"So when a foreign state is not immune from suit, it is subject to the same rules of liability as a private party. Which is just to say that the substantive law applying to the latter also applies to the former. See First Nat. City Bank, 462 U.S. at 622, n. 11, 103 S.Ct. 2591. As one court put the point, Section 1606 directs a pass-through to the substantive law that would govern a similar suit between private individuals. Oveissi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 573 F.3d 835, 841 (CADC 2009). The provision thus ensures that a foreign state, if found ineligible for immunity, must answer for its conduct just as any other actor would.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,38,"And in so doing, Section 1606 also dictates the selection of a choice-of-law rule: It, too, must mirror the rule that would apply in a similar suit between private parties. For only the same choice-of-law rule can guarantee use of the same substantive law—and thus (see above) guarantee the same liability. See Barkanic v. General Admin. of Civ. Aviation of People's Republic of China, 923 F.2d 957, 959-960 (CA2 1991) (The same choice of law analysis is needed to apply identical substantive laws, and so to ensure identity of liability between a foreign state and a private individual). Consider two suits seeking recovery of a painting— one suit against a foreign-state-controlled museum (as here), the other against a private museum. If the choice-of-law rules in the two suits differed, so might the substantive law in fact chosen. And if the substantive law differed, so might the suits' outcomes. In one case, say, the plaintiff would recover the art, and in the other not. Contrary to Section 1606, the two museums would not be liable in the same manner and to the same extent.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,39,"In this case, then, Section 1606 requires the use of California's choice-of-law  rule—because that is the rule a court would use in comparable private litigation. Consider the just-hypothesized suit against a private museum for return of a piece of art, brought as this case was in California. The claims asserted (again, as in this case) turn only on state or foreign property law, with no substantive federal component. If the private suit were filed in state court, California's choice-of-law rule would of course govern. And if the private suit were filed in federal court, under diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, the same would be true. According to long-settled precedent, a federal court sitting in diversity borrows the forum State's choice-of-law rule. See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). So the private-museum suit would begin with the application of California's choice-of-law rule, to decide on the governing substantive law. And if that choice-of-law rule applies in the private-museum suit, so too it must apply in the suit here, against the Foundation. That is the only way to ensure—as Section 1606 demands —that the Foundation, although a Spanish instrumentality, will be liable in the same way as a private party.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,40,"In choosing instead to apply a federal choice-of-law rule, the courts below could well have created a mismatch between the Foundation's liability and a private defendant's. As described earlier, those courts found that the federal rule commanded the use of Spanish property law to determine Rue Saint-Honoré's rightful owner. See supra, at 1507. Spanish law (as the courts below understood it) made everything depend on whether, at the time of acquisition, the Foundation knew the painting was stolen: If the Foundation did not know—as the courts in fact found—then it owned the painting by virtue of possession. See ECF Doc. No. 621, at 26-30, aff'd, 824 Fed.Appx. at 454-455. But now consider the possible result if the courts below had instead applied California's choice-of-law rule, as they would have done in a private suit. The Cassirer plaintiffs contend that the California rule would lead to the application of California property law. See Brief for Petitioners 13. And they argue that under California property law, even a good-faith purchaser of stolen property cannot prevail against the rightful pre-theft owner. See ibid. We do not today decide those questions, they remain in the hands of the lower courts. But if the Cassirers are right, the use of a federal choice-of-law rule in the courts below stopped Section 1606 from working: That rule led to the Foundation keeping the painting when a private museum would have had to give it back.",Kagan,0,
2021-038,41,"And even were Section 1606 not so clear, we would likely reach the same result, because we see scant justification for federal common lawmaking in this context. Judicial creation of federal common law to displace state-created rules must be necessary to protect uniquely federal interests. Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 640, 101 S.Ct. 2061, 68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981). Foreign relations is of course an interest of that kind. But even the Federal Government, participating here in support of the Cassirers' position, disclaims any necessity for a federal choice-of-law rule in FSIA suits raising non-federal claims. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9, 20-23. As the Government notes, such FSIA suits arise only when a foreign state has lost its broad immunity and become subject to standard-fare legal claims involving property, contract, or the like. See id., at 9. No one would think federal law displaces the substantive rule of decision in those suits, and we see no greater warrant for federal law to supplant the otherwise applicable choice-of-law rule. See id., at 21 (State  choice-of-law rules do not ordinarily pose a greater threat to foreign relations than state-law principles determining the rights and liabilities of the parties). Courts outside the Ninth Circuit have long applied state choice-of-law rules in FSIA suits. See supra, at 1508, and n. 2. Yet the Government says it knows of no case in which that practice has created foreign relations concerns. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21.3 So the Ninth Circuit's use of a federal choice-of-law rule in FSIA cases has been a solution in search of a problem, rejecting without any reason the usual role of state law.* * *",Kagan,0,
2021-038,42,"The path of our decision has been as short as the hunt for Rue Saint-Honoré was long, our ruling is as simple as the conflict over its rightful owner has been vexed. A foreign state or instrumentality in an FSIA suit is liable just as a private party would be. See § 1606. That means the standard choice-of-law rule must apply. In a property-law dispute like this one, that standard rule is the forum State's (here, California's)—not any deriving from federal common law.",Kagan,0,

2021-039,51,"Flags are almost as old as human civilization. Indeed, flags symbolize civilization. From the primordial rag dipped in the blood of a conquered enemy and lifted high on a stick, to the feudal banner bearing a lord's coats of arms, to the standards of the Aztecs, nearly every society has taken a piece of cloth and endowed it, through the circumstances of its display, with a condensed power to speak for the community. W. Smith, Flags Through the Ages and Across the World 1-2, 32, 34 (1975). Little wonder that the Continental Congress, seeking to define a new nation, resolved on June 14, 1777, that the Flag of the  United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation. 8 Journals of the Continental Congress 1774-1789, p. 464 (W.

See C. Lineberry, The Story Behind the Star Spangled Banner, Smithsonian Magazine (Mar. 1, 2007).

When flying at halfstaff, it conveys a community message of sympathy or somber remembrance. When displayed at other public buildings, it marks the mayor's presence. See Symbols of Boston. The city also sometimes conveys a message by replacing its flag with another.

2021-039,56,"While this history favors Boston, it is only our starting point. The question remains whether, on the 20 or so times a year when Boston allowed private groups to raise their own flags, those flags, too, expressed the city's message. So we must examine the details of this flag-flying program.",Breyer,0,
2021-039,57,"Next, then, we consider whether the public would tend to view the speech at issue as the government's. In this case, the circumstantial evidence does not tip the scale. On an ordinary day, a passerby on Cambridge Street sees three government flags representing the Nation, State, and city. Those flags wave in unison, side-by-side, from matching flagpoles, just outside `the entrance to Boston's seat of government.' 986 F.3d at 88. Like the monuments in the public park in Summum, the flags play an important role in defining the identity that the city projects to its own residents and to the outside world. 555 U.S. at 472, 129 S.Ct. 1125. So, like the license plates in Walker, the public seems likely to see the flags as `conveying some message' on the government's `behalf.' 576 U.S. at 212, 135 S.Ct. 2239 (quoting Summum, 555 U.S. at 471, 129 S.Ct. 1125).",Breyer,0,
2021-039,58,"But as we have said, Boston allowed its flag to be lowered and other flags to be raised with some regularity. These other flags were raised in connection with ceremonies at the flagpoles' base and remained aloft during the events. Petitioners say that a pedestrian glimpsing a flag other than Boston's on the third flagpole might simply look down onto the plaza, see a group of private citizens conducting a ceremony without the city's presence, and associate the new flag with them, not Boston. Thus, even if the public would ordinarily associate a flag's message with Boston, that is not necessarily true for the flags at issue here. Again, this evidence of the public's perception does not resolve whether Boston conveyed a city message with these flags.",Breyer,0,

2021-039,61,"On this issue, Boston's record is thin. Boston says that all (or at least most) of the 50 unique flags it approved reflect particular city-approved values or views. Flying flags associated with other countries celebrated Bostonians' many different national origins, flying other flags, Boston adds, was not wholly unconnected from a diversity message or some other day or cause the City or Commonwealth had already endorsed.

See Brief for Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. as Amici Curiae 25-26 (citing reports that the then-mayor of Boston gave remarks as the Pride Flag was raised).

2021-039,62,"In any event, we do not settle this dispute by counting noses—or, rather, counting flags. That is so for several reasons. For one thing, Boston told the public that it sought to accommodate all applicants who wished to hold events at Boston's public forums, including on City Hall Plaza. App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a. The application form asked only for contact information and a brief description of the event, with proposed dates and times. The city employee who handled applications testified by deposition that he had previously never requested to review a flag or requested changes to a flag in connection with approval, nor did he even see flags before the events. Id., at 150a. The city's practice was to approve flag raisings, without exception. It has no record of denying a request until Shurtleff's. Boston acknowledges it hadn't spent a lot of time really thinking about its flag-raising practices until this case. App. in No. 20-1158 (CA1), at 140 (Rooney deposition).

2021-039,69,Boston acknowledges that it denied Shurtleff's request because it believed flying a religious flag at City Hall could violate the Establishment Clause. And it admits this concern proceeded from the premise that raising the flag would express government speech.

See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 830-834, 115 S.Ct. 2510. Here, Boston concedes that it denied Shurtleff's request solely because the Christian flag he asked to raise promoted a specific religion.

2021-039,78,"This dispute arose only because of a government official's mistaken understanding of the Establishment Clause. A Boston official believed that the City would violate the Establishment Clause if it allowed a religious flag to briefly fly outside of City Hall as part of the flag-raising program that the City had opened to the public. So Boston granted requests to fly a variety of secular flags, but denied a request to fly a religious flag. As this Court has repeatedly made clear, however, a government does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because it treats religious persons, organizations, and speech equally with secular persons, organizations, and speech in public programs, benefits, facilities, and the like. See, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002).

2021-039,80,"I agree with the Court's conclusion that Boston (hereafter City) violated the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech when it rejected Camp Constitution's application to fly what it characterized as a Christian flag. But I cannot go along with the Court's decision to analyze this case in terms of the triad of factors— history, the public's perception of who is speaking, and the extent to which the government has exercised control over speech—that our decision in Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200, 135 S.Ct. 2239, 192 L.Ed.2d 274 (2015), derived from Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 129 S.Ct. 1125, 172 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). See ante, at 1589-1593. As the Court now recognizes, those cases did not set forth a test that always and everywhere applies when the government claims that its actions are immune to First Amendment challenge under the government-speech doctrine. And treating those factors as a test obscures the real question in government-speech cases: whether the government is speaking instead of regulating private expression.",Alito,0,
2021-039,82,"The government-speech doctrine recognizes that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment restricts government regulation of private speech but does not regulate government speech. Summum, 555 U.S. at 467, 129 S.Ct. 1125. That doctrine presents no serious problems when the government speaks in its own voice— for example, when an official gives a speech in a representative capacity or a governmental body issues a report. But courts must be very careful when a government claims that speech by one or more private speakers is actually government speech. When that occurs, it can be difficult to tell whether the government is using the doctrine as a subterfuge for favoring certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint, id., at 473, 129 S.Ct. 1125, and the government-speech doctrine becomes susceptible to dangerous misuse, Matal v. Tam, 582 U. S. ___, ___-___, 137 S.Ct. 1744, 1758, 198 L.Ed.2d 366 (2017).",Alito,0,
2021-039,83,"In Tam, for example, the United States defended a statutory provision that permitted the Patent and Trademark Office to deny federal registration to disparaging marks, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a), on the theory that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech. 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1760. We rejected that argument and held that because the Government's role in registration was limited to applying a standard of assessment to marks generated by private parties, registered marks are not government speech. Id., at ___-___, 137 S.Ct., at 1757-1758. But the Government's position had radical implications: If registration transforms trademarks into government speech, the same logic would presumably hold for other speech included on systems of government registration. Books on the copyright registry, for example, would count as the Government's own speech—presumably subject to editorial control. And the Government would be free to exclude authors from copyright protection based on their views. Id., at ___-___, 137 S.Ct., at 1759-1761.",Alito,0,
2021-039,84,"To prevent the government-speech doctrine from being used as a cover for censorship,  courts must focus on the identity of the speaker. The ultimate question is whether the government is actually expressing its own views or the real speaker is a private party and the government is surreptitiously engaged in the regulation of private speech. Summum, 555 U.S. at 467, 129 S.Ct. 1125. But our precedent has never attempted to specify a general method for deciding that question, and the Court goes wrong in proceeding as though our decisions in Walker and Summum settled on anything that might be considered a government-speech analysis. Ante, at 1590. In both cases, we employed a fact-bound totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry that relied on the factors that appeared helpful in evaluating whether the speech at issue was government or private speech. See Walker, 576 U.S. at 210-213, 135 S.Ct. 2239, Summum, 555 U.S. at 470-478, 129 S.Ct. 1125. We did not set out a test to be used in all government-speech cases, and we did not purport to define an exhaustive list of relevant factors. And in light of the ultimate focus of the government-speech inquiry, each of the factors mentioned in those cases could be relevant only insofar as it sheds light on the identity of the speaker. When considered in isolation from that inquiry, the factors central to Walker and Summum can lead a court astray.",Alito,0,
2021-039,85,"Consider first the extent to which the government has actively shaped or controlled the expression. Ante, at 1590. Government control over speech is relevant to speaker identity in that speech by a private individual or group cannot constitute government speech if the government does not attempt to control the message. But control is also an essential element of censorship. Consider this example. The British Licensing Act of 1737, 10 Geo. II c. 28, § 1, in 17 Eng. Stat. at Large 140 (1765), as amended by the Theatres Act of 1843, 6 & 7 Vict. c. 68, § 2 (1843), prohibited the performance of any interlude, tragedy, comedy, opera, play, farce, or other entertainment without a patent issued by the King of England or a License from the Lord Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household. Ibid. This regime attracted criticism precisely because it gave the Lord Chamberlain extensive control over the nature and content, ante, at ___, of covered performances. One of the leading critics of the Act—the playwright George Bernard Shaw—was denied permission to perform several plays, including Mrs. Warren's Profession, The Shewing-up of Blanco Posnet, and Press Cuttings.1 But had the Lord Chamberlain approved these plays, would anyone seriously maintain that those plays were thereby transmuted into the government's speech?",Alito,0,
2021-039,86,"As this illustration shows, neither control nor final approval authority can in itself distinguish government speech from censorship of private speech, and analyzing that factor in isolation from speaker identity flattens the distinction between government speech and speech tolerated by the censor. And it is not as though actively exercising control over the nature and content of private expression makes a difference, as the Court suggests, ibid. Censorship is not made constitutional by aggressive and direct application.",Alito,0,
2021-039,87,"Next, turn to the history of the means of expression. Ibid. Historical practice can establish that a means of expression typically represents government speech. Summum, 555 U.S. at 470, 129 S.Ct. 1125 (emphasis added), Tam, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1759-1760. But in determining whether speech is the government's, the real question is not whether a form of expression is usually linked with the government but whether the speech at issue  expresses the government's own message. Governments can put public resources to novel uses. And when governments allow private parties to use a resource normally devoted to government speech to express their own messages, the government cannot rely on historical expectations to pass off private speech as its own. Cf. Summum, 555 U.S. at 480, 129 S.Ct. 1125 (explaining that even though monuments in parks are normally government speech, that would not be true if a town created a monument on which all of its residents (or all those meeting some other criterion) could place the name of a person to be honored or some other private message).",Alito,0,
2021-039,88,"This case exemplifies the point. Governments have long used flags to express government messages, so this factor provides prima facie support for Boston's position under the Court's mode of analysis. Ante, at 1590-1592. But on these facts, the history of flags clearly cannot have any bearing on whether the flag displays express the City's own message. The City put the flagpoles to an unorthodox use— allowing private parties to use the poles to express messages that were not formulated by City officials. Treating this factor as significant in that circumstance loads the dice in favor of the government's position for no obvious reason.",Alito,0,
2021-039,89,"Now consider the third factor: the public's likely perception as to who (the government or a private person) is speaking. Ante, at 1589-1590. Our earlier government-speech precedents recognized that the correct focus of the government-speech inquiry is not on whether the  reasonable viewer would identify the speech as the government's, Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U.S. 550, 564, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2055, 161 L.Ed.2d 896 (2005), and with good reason. Unless the public is assumed to be omniscient, public perception cannot be relevant to whether the government is speaking, as opposed merely appearing to speak. Focusing on public perception encourages courts to categorize private expression as government speech in circumstances in which the public is liable to misattribute that speech to the government. This case once again provides an apt illustration. As the Court rightly notes, a passerby on Cambridge Street confronted with a flag flanked by government flags standing just outside the entrance of Boston's seat of government would likely conclude that all of those flags convey some message on the government's behalf. Ante, at 1591 (internal quotation marks omitted). If that is the case, this factor supports the exclusion of private parties from using the flagpoles even though the government allows private parties to use the flagpoles to express private messages, presumably because those messages may be erroneously attributed to the government. But there is no obvious reason why a government should be entitled to suppress private views that might be attributed to it by engaging in viewpoint discrimination. The government can always disavow any messages that might be mistakenly attributed to it.",Alito,0,
2021-039,90,"The factors relied upon by the Court are thus an uncertain guide to speaker identity. But beyond that, treating these factors as a freestanding test for the existence of government speech artificially separates the question whether the government is speaking from whether the government is facilitating or regulating private speech. Under the Court's factorized approach, government speech occurs when the government exercises a sufficient degree of control over speech that occurs in a setting connected with government speech in the eyes of history and the contemporary public, regardless of whether the government is actually merely facilitating private speech. This approach allows governments  to exploit public expectations to mask censorship.",Alito,0,
2021-039,91,"And like any factorized analysis, this approach cannot provide a principled way of deciding cases. The Court's analysis here proves the point. The Court concludes that two of the three factors—history and public perception—favor the City. But it nonetheless holds that the flag displays did not constitute government speech. Why these factors drop out of the analysis—or even do not justify a contrary conclusion— is left unsaid. This cannot be the right way to determine when governmental action is exempt from the First Amendment.",Alito,0,
2021-039,94,"I would resolve this case using a different method for determining whether the government is speaking. In my view, the minimum conditions that must be met for expression to count as government speech can be identified by considering the definition of government speech and the rationale for the government-speech doctrine. Under the resulting view, government speech occurs if—but only if—a government purposefully expresses a message of its own through persons authorized to speak on its behalf, and in doing so, does not rely on a means that abridges private speech.",Alito,0,
2021-039,95,"Defined in literal terms, government speech is speech spoken by the government. Speech, as that term is used in our First Amendment jurisprudence, refers to expressive activity that is intended to be communicative and, in context, would reasonably be understood  to be communicative. Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 294, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984), see also Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 569, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995). Our government-speech precedents have worked with largely the same definition. See, e.g., Summum, 555 U.S. at 472, 129 S.Ct. 1125 (accepting monument for placement in a city park constituted government speech because the monuments were meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message), Walker, 576 U.S. at 214, 135 S.Ct. 2239 (similar). And although this definition of speech is not fully precise, the purposeful communication of the speaker's own message generally qualifies as speech.",Alito,0,
2021-039,96,"For speech to be spoken by the government, the relevant act of communication must be government action. Governments are not natural persons and can only communicate through human agents who have been given the power to speak for the government. When individuals charged with speaking on behalf of the government act within the scope of their power to do so, they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). And because speech requires the purposeful communication of the speaker's own message, the message expressed must have been formulated by a person with the power to determine what messages the government will communicate. In short, the government must set the overall message to be communicated through official action. Johanns, 544 U.S. at 562, 125 S.Ct. 2055.",Alito,0,
2021-039,97,"Government speech is thus the purposeful communication of a governmentally determined message by a person exercising a power to speak for a government. But not all governmental activity that qualifies as government speech in this literal and factual sense is exempt from First Amendment scrutiny. For although we have said  that the Free Speech Clause has no application when a government is engaging in its own expressive conduct, Summum, 555 U.S. at 467, 129 S.Ct. 1125, we have also recognized that the Free Speech Clause itself may constrain the government's speech under certain conditions, as when a government seeks to compel private persons to convey the government's speech. Walker, 576 U.S. at 208, 135 S.Ct. 2239, see also Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943).",Alito,0,
2021-039,98,"That is because the government-speech doctrine is not based on the view—which we have neither accepted nor rejected— that governmental entities have First Amendment rights. See United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U.S. 194, 210-211, 123 S.Ct. 2297, 156 L.Ed.2d 221 (2003), Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 139, and n. 7, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring).2 Instead, the doctrine is based on the notion that governmental communication —and the exercise of control over those charged by law with implementing a government's communicative agenda—do not normally restrict the activities of  persons acting as private individuals. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 198-199, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), see also Summum, 555 U.S. at 467, 129 S.Ct. 1125 (The Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private speech), Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833-835, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995). So government speech in the literal sense is not exempt from First Amendment attack if it uses a means that restricts private expression in a way that abridges the freedom of speech, as is the case with compelled speech. Were it otherwise, virtually every government action that regulates private speech would, paradoxically, qualify as government speech unregulated by the First Amendment. Naked censorship of a speaker based on viewpoint, for example, might well constitute expression in the thin sense that it conveys the government's disapproval of the speaker's message. But plainly that kind of action cannot fall beyond the reach of the First Amendment.",Alito,0,
2021-039,99,"It follows that to establish that expression constitutes government speech exempt from First Amendment attack, the government must satisfy two conditions. First, it must show that the challenged activity constitutes government speech in the literal sense—purposeful communication of a governmentally determined message by a person acting within the scope of a power to speak for the government. Second, the government must establish it did not rely on a means that abridges the speech of persons acting in a private capacity. It is only then that the Free Speech Clause has no application. Summum, 555 U.S. at 467, 129 S.Ct. 1125.",Alito,0,
2021-039,100,"This framework explains the conditions under which government communication that relies on private parties can constitute government speech. Our precedents recognize  two ways in which a government can speak using private assistance. First, the government can prospectively enlist private entities to convey its own message, Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833, 115 S.Ct. 2510, by deputizing private persons as its agents. See Johanns, 544 U.S. at 560-562, and n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 2055, Rust, 500 U.S. at 192-200, 111 S.Ct. 1759. In that kind of situation, private persons assume a public or quasi-public capacity that empowers them to speak on behalf of the government. So long as this responsibility is voluntarily assumed, speech by a private party within the scope of his power to speak for the government constitutes government speech.",Alito,0,
2021-039,101,"Second, the government can adopt a medium of expression created by a private party and use it to express a government message. Summum, 555 U.S. at 473-474, 129 S.Ct. 1125. In that circumstance, private parties are not deputized by the government, instead a private person generates a medium of expression and transfers it to the government. Id., at 472-474, 129 S.Ct. 1125. For the adopted expression to qualify as the government's, the private party must alienate control over the medium of expression to the government. And government actors must put the medium to use to intentionally express a government message. Compare id., at 473-475, 129 S.Ct. 1125 (holding that a government adopted donated monument because it took ownership of that monument and put it on permanent display in a park that it owns and manages), with Tam, 582 U. S., at ___, ___-___, 137 S.Ct., at 1753, 1757-1759 (no adoption occurred because governments neither produced nor took ownership of privately generated trademarks). Otherwise, the government is simply providing a forum for private parties to submit their own productions and usual First Amendment principles apply. And to avoid running afoul of the prohibition on compelled speech, that alienation must be voluntary.3",Alito,0,
2021-039,102,"This approach also explains the circumstances in which we have concluded that the government is not speaking. We have repeatedly held that the government-speech doctrine does not extend to private-party speech that is merely subsidized or otherwise facilitated by the government. See, e.g., Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 542, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001), Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229, 120 S.Ct. 1346, 146 L.Ed.2d 193 (2000), Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833-834, 115 S.Ct. 2510. Facilitating speech by private persons cannot constitute government speech unless the government assigns a power to speak to those persons or appropriates the products of their expressive activity to express its own message. When the government's role is limited to applying a standard of assessment  to determine a speaker's eligibility for a benefit, the government is regulating private speech, and ordinary First Amendment principles apply. Tam, 582 U. S., at ___-___, 137 S.Ct., at 1757-1758.",Alito,0,
2021-039,103,"For analogous reasons, private-party expression in any type of forum recognized by our precedents does not constitute government speech. A forum, by definition, is a space for private parties to express their own views. The government can of course speak as a participant in a forum, but the creation of a space for private discourse does not involve expressing a governmental message, deputizing private parties to express it, or adopting a private party's contribution as a vehicle of government speech. So when examination of the government's policy and practice indicates that the government has intentionally opened a nontraditional forum for public discourse, a court may immediately infer that private-party expression in the forum is not government speech. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985). There is no need to consider history, public perception, or control in the abstract.",Alito,0,
2021-039,105,"Analyzed under this framework, the flag displays were plainly private speech within a forum created by the City, not government speech. The record attests that the City's application materials—which were the only written form of guidance available on the program prior to the adoption of a written policy in 2018—characterized the flagpoles as one of the City's public forums. App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a. The application guidelines did not enumerate any criteria for access to the flagpoles that go beyond those typical of a resource that has been made generally available to the public. Id., at 137a-140a. The first rejection of an application was the denial of Camp Constitution's application in 2017. Id., at 150a-158a. Prior to then, the City never rejected any request to raise a flag submitted by any private party. And private speakers accounted for 78% of the flag-raising applicants. See Reply Brief 8.",Alito,0,
2021-039,106,"A program with this design cannot possibly constitute government speech. The City did nothing to indicate an intent to communicate a message. Clark, 468 U.S. at 294, 104 S.Ct. 3065. Nor did it deputize private speakers or appropriate private-party expressive content. The flags flown reflected a dizzying and contradictory array of perspectives that cannot be understood to express the message of a single speaker. For example, the City allowed parties to fly the gay pride flag, App. to Pet. for Cert. 142a, but it allowed others to fly the flag of Ethiopia, id., at 174a, a country in which homosexual acts are punishable by imprisonment for not less than one year. The Crim. Code of Fed. Democratic Republic of Eth. 2004, Arts. 629 and 630, Proclamation No. 414/2004. Indeed, the City disclaimed virtually all messages expressed by characterizing the flagpoles as a public forum and adopting access criteria consistent with generalized public use. The City's policy and practice thus squarely indicate an intent to open a public forum for any private speakers who met the City's basic criteria. The requirement of viewpoint neutrality applies to any forum of this kind. Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439.",Alito,0,
2021-039,107,"As the Court rightly holds, denying Shurtleff's application to use that forum constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination. Ante, at 1593. The City's stated reason for rejecting Camp Constitution's application was an unwritten policy and practice of `refraining from flying non-secular flags on the City Hall flagpoles.' App. to Pet. for Cert. 153a-154a.",Alito,0,
2021-039,108,"But as we have recognized, religion constitutes a viewpoint, and speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects cannot be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious point of view. Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, 112, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001), Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 835, 115 S.Ct. 2510.",Alito,0,
2021-039,109,"The City's decision was grounded in a belief that established First Amendment jurisprudence prohibits a government from allowing a private party to fly a religious flag on public property.

But more than once, this Court has rejected the position that the Establishment Clause even justifies, much less requires, a refusal to extend free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broad-reaching government programs neutral in design. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 839, 115 S.Ct. 2510, see also Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 112, 121 S.Ct. 2093, Lamb's Chapel v.

Indeed, excluding religious messages from public forums that are open to other viewpoints is a denial of the right of free speech indicating hostility to religion that would undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause requires. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 845-846, 115 S.Ct. 2510, see also Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools Dist. 66 v.

2021-039,110,"Although developments in City policy postdating the denial of Shurtleff's application are not relevant to whether that act constituted a First Amendment violation, it should be emphasized that the City's adoption of a written policy in October 2018 did not to convert the flag displays into government speech. The policy's principal provision specified that the City will not display flags deemed to be inappropriate or offensive in nature or those supporting discrimination, prejudice, or religious viewpoints. App. in No. 20-1158 (CA1), p. 570 (App).4 That provision did not identify a message the City intended to express, it simply codified the City's prior exclusion of speakers expressing a religious viewpoint and extended it to messages deemed offensive, despite the bedrock First Amendment principle that speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.

2021-039,111,"In briefing before this Court, counsel for the City argued that despite all appearances to the contrary, the City actually did intend to express a message through the flag-raising program: The City's support for the diverse national heritage of the City's population. Brief for Respondents 19. All other flag raisings, the City claims,  occurred in connection with some publicly designated date of observance. Ibid. This argument is a transparent attempt to reverse engineer a governmental message from facts about the flag raisings that occurred. It is true that many of the flag raisings from 2007 to 2015 celebrated nationalities. App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a-187a. But these events were conducted by private organizations to express their own support for the relevant national communities. Neither the City's application guidance nor the 2018 written policy singled out a connection with a nationality commemoration as a condition of access to the flagpoles. The City never cited this purported requirement in its rejection of the applications it denied. And the City approved flags that had nothing to do with nationality or official holidays, such as the Metro Credit Union Flag Raising mentioned by the Court.",Alito,0,
2021-039,112,"Even if the City had reserved the flagpoles for nationality commemorations and official holidays, that would only mean that the City had reserved the flagpoles for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics and created a nonpublic forum, not that it had engaged in government speech. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510, see also Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 49, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (Implicit in the concept of the nonpublic forum is the right to make distinctions in access on the basis of subject matter and speaker identity). Had the City restricted use of the flagpoles to these subject matters, it could have relied on the forum's topical limitations to deny applications to host events. But it could not have employed viewpoint-discriminatory criteria to bar otherwise-eligible speakers from expressing their own views on those subjects.",Alito,0,
2021-039,113,"On this record, however, the only viable inference is that the City had no policy restricting access to the forum apart from the modest access conditions articulated in the application materials.

2021-039,115,"The real problem in this case doesn't stem from Boston's mistake about the scope of the government speech doctrine or its error in applying our public forum precedents. The trouble here runs deeper than that. Boston candidly admits that it refused to fly the petitioners' flag while allowing a secular group to fly a strikingly similar banner. And the city admits it did so for one reason and one reason only: It thought displaying the petitioners' flag would violate `the Constitution's Establishment Clause.' App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a, see also id., at 153a-154a. That decision led directly to this lawsuit, all the years of litigation that followed, and the city's loss today. Not a single Member of the Court seeks to defend Boston's view that a municipal policy allowing all groups to fly their flags, secular and religious alike, would offend the Establishment Clause.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,116,"How did the city get it so wrong? To be fair, at least some of the blame belongs here and traces back to Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). Issued during a `bygone era' when this Court took a more freewheeling approach to interpreting legal texts, Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2356, 2364, 204 L.Ed.2d 742 (2019), Lemon sought to devise a one-size-fits-all  test for resolving Establishment Clause disputes. That project bypassed any inquiry into the Clause's original meaning. It ignored longstanding precedents. And instead of bringing clarity to the area, Lemon produced only chaos. In time, this Court came to recognize these problems, abandoned Lemon, and returned to a more humble jurisprudence centered on the Constitution's original meaning. Yet in this case, the city chose to follow Lemon anyway. It proved a costly decision, and Boston's travails supply a cautionary tale for other localities and lower courts.*",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,117,"To see how all this unfolded, start with Lemon itself. Lemon held out the promise that any Establishment Clause dispute could be resolved by following a neat checklist focused on three questions: (1) Did the government have a secular purpose in its challenged action? (2) Does the effect of that action advance or inhibit religion? (3) Will the government action excessively  entangle church and state? 403 U. S., at 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105 (internal quotation marks omitted). But from the start, this seemingly simple test produced more questions than answers. How much religion-promoting purpose is too much? Are laws that serve both religious and secular purposes problematic? How much of a religion-advancing effect is tolerable? What does excessive entanglement even mean, and what (if anything) does it add to the analysis? Putting it all together, too, what is a court to do when Lemon's three inquiries point in conflicting directions? More than 50 years later, the answers to all these questions remain unknown.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,118,"The only sure thing Lemon yielded was new business for lawyers and judges. Before Lemon, this Court had never held a flag or other similar public display to constitute an unconstitutional establishment of religion. See Congressional Research Service, C. Brougher, Public Display of the Ten Commandments and Other Religious Symbols 1-2 (2011) (Brougher), M. McConnell, No More (Old) Symbol Cases, 2019 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 91 (2019) (Symbol Cases). After Lemon, cases challenging public displays under the Establishment Clause came fast and furious. And just like the test itself, the results proved a garble. May a State or local government display a Christmas nativity scene? Some courts said yes, others no.1 How about a menorah? Again, the answers ran both ways.2 What about a city seal that features a cross? Good luck.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,119,"If anything, the confusion grew with time. In the years following Lemon, this Court modified its effects test by requiring lower courts to ask whether a reasonable observer would consider the government's challenged action to be an endorsement of religion. See, e.g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 593, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989), id., at 630, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and  concurring in judgment). But rather than fix Lemon's problems, this new gloss compounded them. Some argued that any reasonable observer worthy of the name would consider all the relevant facts and law, just as a judge or jury must. See Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 778-781, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 132 L.Ed.2d 650 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part). Others suggested that a reasonable observer could make mistakes about the law or fail to consider all the facts. See, e.g., American Atheists, Inc. v. Duncan, 616 F.3d 1145, 1160-1161 (C.A.10 2010). And that suggestion only raised even more questions. Just how mistake-prone might an observer be and still qualify as reasonable? On what authority may courts exercise the awesome power of judicial review to declare a duly enacted law unconstitutional thanks only to (admitted) errors about the relevant facts or law? See American Atheists, Inc. v. Davenport, 637 F.3d 1095, 1108-1110 (C.A.10 2010) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,120,"Ultimately, Lemon devolved into a kind of children's game. Start with a Christmas scene, a menorah, or a flag. Then pick your own reasonable observer avatar. In this game, the avatar's default settings are lazy, uninformed about history, and not particularly inclined to legal research. His default mood is irritable. To play, expose your avatar to the display and ask for his reaction. How does he feel about it? Mind you: Don't ask him whether the proposed display actually amounts to an establishment of religion. Just ask him if he feels it endorses religion. If so, game over.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,121,"Faced with such a malleable test, risk-averse local officials found themselves in an ironic bind. To avoid Establishment Clause liability, they sometimes felt they had to discriminate against religious speech and suppress religious exercises. But those actions, in turn, only invited liability under other provisions of the First Amendment. The hard truth is, Lemon's abstract and ahistoric test put policymakers in a vise between the Establishment Clause on one side and the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses on the other. Pinette, 515 U.S. at 767-768, 115 S.Ct. 2440 (plurality opinion).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,122,"Our case illustrates the problem. The flags of many nations bear religious symbols. So do the flags of various private groups. Historically, Boston has allowed them all. The city has even flown a flag with a cross nearly identical in size to the one on petitioners' flag. It was a banner presented by a secular group to commemorate the Battle of Bunker Hill. See Appendix, infra (photographs). Yet when the petitioners offered their flag, the city flinched. Perhaps it worried: Would the assigned judge's imagined reasonable observer bother to learn about its generous policy for secular groups? Would this observer take the trouble to consult the long tradition in this country allowing comparable displays? Or would he turn out to be an uninformed passerby offended by the seeming incongruity of a new flag flying beside those of the city, State, and Nation? Who could tell. Better to err on the safe side and reject the petitioners' flag. As it turned out, though, that route only invited years of litigation and a unanimous adverse decision because no government may discriminate against religious speech in a public forum. To avoid a spurious First Amendment problem, Boston wound up inviting a real one. Call it a Lemon trade.4  *",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,123,"While it is easy to see how Lemon led to a strange world in which local governments have sometimes violated the First Amendment in the name of protecting it, less clear is why this state of affairs still persists.

2021-039,124,"From the birth of modern Establishment Clause litigation in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, this Court looked primarily to historical practices and analogues to guide its analysis. 330 U.S. 1, 9-15, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947). So, for example, while the dissent in Everson disagreed with some of the majority's conclusions about what qualifies as an establishment of religion, it readily agreed that no provision of the Constitution is more closely tied to or given content by its generating history than the religious clause of the First Amendment. Id., at 33-49, 67 S.Ct. 504 (Rutledge, J., dissenting). This approach fit, too, with this Court's usual course in other areas. Often, we have looked to early and long-continued historical practices as evidence of the Constitution's meaning at the time of its adoption.5 And, in the years following Everson, the Court followed this same path when interpreting the Establishment Clause. Agree or disagree with the conclusions in these cases, there can be little doubt that the Court approached them in large part using history as its guide.6",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,125,"Lemon interrupted this long line of precedents. It offered no plausible reason for ignoring their teachings. And, as we have seen, the ahistoric alternative it offered quickly proved both unworkable in  practice and unsound in its results. Nor is it as if Lemon vanquished the field even during its heyday. Often, this Court continued to look to history to resolve certain Establishment Clause disputes outside the context of religious displays.7 And several early decisions applying Lemon were themselves rapidly overruled in part or in whole.8 All of which in time led Justice after Justice to conclude that Lemon was flawed in its fundamentals, unworkable in practice, and inconsistent with our history and our precedents.

And if your policy goal is to lump in religious speech with fighting words and obscenity, if it is to celebrate only a particular type of diversity consistent with popular ideology, the First Amendment is not exactly your friend. Dragging Lemon from its grave may be your only chance.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,131,"To the extent this is why some still invoke Lemon today, it reflects poorly on us all. Through history, the suppression of unpopular religious speech and exercise has been among the favorite tools of petty tyrants. See Pinette, 515 U.S. at 760, 115 S.Ct. 2440, Feldman v. United States, 322 U.S. 487, 501, 64 S.Ct. 1082, 88 L.Ed. 1408 (1944) (Black, J., dissenting). Our forebears resolved that this Nation would be different. Here, they resolved, each individual would enjoy the right to make sense of his relationship with the divine, speak freely about man's place in creation, and have his religious practices treated with respect. See West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943). The day governments in this country forage for ways to abandon these foundational promises is a dark day for the cause of individual freedom.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,132,"Besides, even for those whose policy ambitions run in this direction, invoking Lemon is a myopic tactic. For as long as the First Amendment means anything, government  policies that discriminate against religious speech and exercise will only invite litigation and result in losses like Boston's. Today's case is just one more in a long line of reminders about the costs associated with governmental efforts to discriminate against disfavored religious speakers. See Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, 120, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001), Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 392-397, 113 S.Ct. 2141, Rosenberger v.

2021-039,133,"Second, it seems that Lemon may occasionally shuffle from its grave for another and more prosaic reason. By demanding a careful examination of the Constitution's original meaning, a proper application of the Establishment Clause no doubt requires serious work and can pose its challenges. Lemon's abstract three-part test may seem a simpler and tempting alternative to busy local officials and lower courts. But if this is part of the problem, it isn't without at least a partial remedy. For our constitutional history contains some helpful hallmarks that localities and lower courts can rely on.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,134,"Beyond a formal declaration that a religious denomination was in fact the established church, it seems that founding-era religious establishments often bore certain other telling traits. See M. McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2110-2112, 2131 (2003) (Establishment and Disestablishment). First, the government exerted control over the doctrine and personnel of the established church. Second, the government mandated attendance in the established church and punished people for failing to participate. Third, the government punished dissenting churches and individuals for their religious exercise. Fourth, the government restricted political participation by dissenters. Fifth, the government provided financial support for the established church, often in a way that preferred the established denomination over other churches. And sixth, the government used the established church to carry out certain civil functions, often by giving the established church a monopoly over a specific function. See id., at 2131-2181. Most of these hallmarks reflect forms of coercion regarding religion or its exercise. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 587, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992), id., at 640, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Scalia, J., dissenting), Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 693, 125 S.Ct. 2854 (THOMAS, J., concurring).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,135,"These traditional hallmarks help explain many of this Court's Establishment Clause cases, too. This Court, for example, has held unlawful practices that restrict political participation by dissenters, including rules requiring public officials to proclaim a belief in God. See Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 490, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961). It has checked government efforts to give churches monopolistic control over civil functions. See Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116, 127, 103 S.Ct. 505, 74 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982). At the same time, it has upheld nondiscriminatory public financial support for religious institutions alongside other entities. See Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 591 U. S. ___, ___-___, 140 S.Ct. 2246, 2260-2263, 207 L.Ed.2d 679 (2020), Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___, ___-___, 137 S.Ct. 2012, 2024-2025, 198 L.Ed.2d 551 (2017), Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 662-663, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002). The thread running through these cases derives directly from the historical hallmarks of an establishment of religion— government control over religion offends the Constitution, but treating a church on par with secular entities and other  churches does not. See Establishment and Disestablishment 2205-2208.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-039,136,"These historical hallmarks also help explain the result in today's case and provide helpful guidance for those faced with future disputes like it. As a close look at these hallmarks and our history reveals, no one at the time of the founding is recorded as arguing that the use of religious symbols in public contexts was a form of religious establishment. Symbol Cases 107. For most of its existence, this country had an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in American life. Lynch, 465 U.S. at 674, 104 S.Ct. 1355.11 In fact and as we have seen, it appears that, until Lemon, this Court had never held the display of a religious symbol to constitute an establishment of religion. See Brougher 1-2, Symbol Cases 91. The simple truth is that no historically sensitive understanding of the Establishment Clause can be reconciled with a rule requiring governments to roam the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine. American Legion, 588 U. S., at 2084-2085. Our Constitution was not designed to erase religion from American life, it was designed to ensure respect and tolerance.

2021-039,137,"To justify a policy that discriminated against religion, Boston sought to drag Lemon once more from its grave. It was a strategy as risky as it was unsound.

2021-040,32,"In order to jumpstart a fledgling campaign or finish strong in a tight race, candidates for federal office often loan money to their campaign committees. A provision of federal law regulates the repayment of such loans. Among other things, it bars campaigns from using more than $250,000 of funds raised after election day to repay a candidate's personal loans. This limit on the use of post-election funds increases the risk that candidate loans over $250,000 will not be repaid in full, inhibiting candidates from making such loans in the first place. The question is whether this restriction violates the First Amendment rights of candidates and their campaigns to engage in political speech.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,35,"Candidates for federal office may, consistent with federal law, use various sources to fund their campaigns. A candidate may spend an unlimited amount of his own money in support of his campaign. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 52-54, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam). His campaign—a legal entity distinct from the candidate himself—may borrow an unlimited amount from third-party lenders or from the candidate himself. See 11 C.F.R. § 110.10 (2017), 52 U.S.C. § 30101(9)(A)(i), see also Buckley, 424 U.S. at 52-54, 96 S.Ct. 612. And campaigns may, of course, accept contributions directly from other organizations or from individuals, subject to monetary limitations. Individual contributions are capped at $2,900 for the primary and $2,900 for the general election. See §§ 30116(a), (c), 86 Fed. Reg. 7869 (2021). Campaigns may continue to receive contributions after election day, so long as those contributions go toward repaying campaign debts. See 11 C.F.R. § 110.1(b)(3)(i).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,36,"Section 304 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 98, 52 U.S.C. § 30116(j), further restricts the use of post-election funds. Under that provision, a candidate who loans money to his campaign may not be repaid more than $250,000 of such loans from contributions made to the campaign after the date of the election. Ibid. To implement that limit, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has  promulgated regulations establishing three rules pertinent here: First, a campaign may repay up to $250,000 in candidate loans using contributions made at any time before, on, or after the date of the election. 11 C.F.R. § 116.12(a). Second, to the extent the loans exceed $250,000, a campaign may use pre-election funds to repay the portion exceeding $250,000 only if the repayment occurs within 20 days of the election. § 116.11(c)(1). And third, if more than $250,000 remains unpaid when the 20-day post-election deadline expires, the campaign must treat the portion above $250,000 as a contribution to the campaign, precluding later repayment. § 116.11(c)(2).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,38,"Appellee Ted Cruz represents Texas in the United States Senate. This case arises from his 2018 reelection campaign, which was, at the time, the most expensive Senate race in history. Before election day, Cruz loaned $260,000 to the other appellee here, Ted Cruz for Senate (Committee). At the end of election day, however, the Committee was in the red by approximately $340,000. App. 285. It eventually began repaying Cruz's loans, but by that time the 20-day post-election window for repaying amounts over $250,000 had closed. See 11 C.F.R. §§ 116.11(c)(1), (2). The Committee accordingly repaid Cruz only $250,000, leaving $10,000 of his personal loans unpaid.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,39,"Cruz and the Committee filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Section 304 of BCRA violates the First Amendment.

2021-040,40,"The three-judge District Court granted Cruz and his Committee summary judgment on their constitutional claim, holding that the loan-repayment limitation burdens political speech without sufficient justification. 542 F.Supp.3d 1 (2021). The District Court also ordered that appellees' challenges to the regulation, previously held in abeyance, be dismissed as moot. The Government appealed directly to this Court, as authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1253. We postponed consideration of our jurisdiction. 594 U. S. ___ (2021).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,42,"The Constitution limits federal courts to deciding Cases and Controversies. Art. III, § 2. Among other things, that limitation requires a plaintiff to have standing. The requisite elements of Article III standing are well established: A plaintiff must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, (3) that is likely to be redressed by the requested relief. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,43,"As the Government recognizes, the Committee's present inability to repay the final $10,000 of Cruz's loans constitutes an injury in fact both to Cruz and to his Committee. See Reply Brief 8. Cruz, of course, suffers a $10,000 pocketbook harm. See Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U. S. 451, 464, 137 S.Ct. 973, 197 L.Ed.2d 398 (2017). And the bar on repayment injures the Committee by preventing it from discharging its obligation to repay its debt, which may inhibit that form of financing in the future. The Government maintains, however, that these injuries are not traceable to the threatened enforcement of Section 304, for two reasons: first, because the inability to repay Cruz's loans was self-inflicted, and second, because it  is the threatened enforcement of an agency regulation, not the statute itself, that causes the harm. We address each argument in turn.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,45,"First, the Government argues that appellees lack standing because their injuries were self-inflicted. Brief for Appellant 20. Because appellees knowingly triggered the application of the loan-repayment limitation, the Government says, any resulting injury is in essence traceable to them, not the Government. The predicate for this argument is appellees' stipulation in the District Court that the sole and exclusive motivation behind Senator Cruz's actions in making the 2018 loans and the Committee's actions in waiting to repay them was to establish the factual basis for this challenge. App. 325. At bottom, the Government asks us to recognize an exception to traceability for injuries that a party purposely incurs.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,46,"We have never recognized a rule of this kind under Article III. To the contrary, we have made clear that an injury resulting from the application or threatened application of an unlawful enactment remains fairly traceable to such application, even if the injury could be described in some sense as willingly incurred. See Evers v. Dwyer, 358 U.S. 202, 204, 79 S.Ct. 178, 3 L.Ed.2d 222 (1958) (per curiam) (that the plaintiff subjected himself to discrimination for the purpose of instituting the litigation did not defeat his standing), Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 374, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982) (a tester plaintiff posing as a renter for purposes of housing-discrimination litigation still suffered an injury under Article III).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,47,"The cases the Government cites do not alter our conclusion. In Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 185 L.Ed.2d 264 (2013), for example, the plaintiffs attempted to manufacture standing by voluntarily taking costly and burdensome measures that they said were necessary to protect the confidentiality of their communications in light of the Government surveillance policy they sought to challenge. Id., at 402, 133 S.Ct. 1138. Their problem, however, was that they could not show that they had been or were likely to be subjected to that policy in any event. Id., at 416, 133 S.Ct. 1138. Likewise, in Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426 U.S. 660, 96 S.Ct. 2333, 49 L.Ed.2d 124 (1976) (per curiam), we held that the unilateral decisions by a group of States to reimburse their residents for taxes levied by other States was not a basis to attack the legality of those taxes. Nothing in the challenged taxes required the plaintiff States to offer reimbursements, accordingly, the financial injury those States suffered was due to their own independent response to taxes levied on others. Id., at 664, 96 S.Ct. 2333. Here, by contrast, the appellees' injuries are directly inflicted by the FEC's threatened enforcement of the provisions they now challenge. That appellees chose to subject themselves to those provisions does not change the fact that they are subject to them, and will face genuine legal penalties if they do not comply. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(a)(5), 11 C.F.R. § 111.24.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,48,"One final point bears mentioning. The Government maintains that it should not be blamed for appellees' injuries because it provided the Committee with a legally available alternative that would have avoided any liability—repaying Cruz's loans in full with pre-election funds, within 20 days of the election. But even if such funds were available, the Government's argument largely misses the point. For standing purposes, we accept as valid the merits of appellees' legal claims, so we must assume that the loan-repayment limitation  —including the 20-day rule—unconstitutionally burdens speech. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff's contention that particular conduct is illegal). Demanding that the Committee comply with the Government's alternative would therefore require it to forgo the exercise of a First Amendment right we must assume it has—the right to repay its campaign debts in full, at any time. And this would require the Committee to subject itself to the very framework it says unconstitutionally burdens its speech. Such a principle finds no support in our standing jurisprudence. See, e.g., Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158-159, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,50,"The Government next asserts that although appellees would have standing to challenge the FEC's implementing regulation, 11 C.F.R. § 116.11, they do not have standing to challenge Section 304 itself. As a reminder, Section 304 prohibits the use of post-election funds to repay a candidate's personal loans, it does not restrict the use of funds raised before the election. See 52 U.S.C. § 30116(j). That restriction comes instead from Section 304's implementing regulation, 11 C.F.R. § 116.11. This regulation provides that neither pre-election nor post-election funds may be used to repay candidate loans above $250,000 outstanding 20 days after the election. §§ 116.11(c)(1)-(2). Such amounts must instead be treated as contributions to the campaign, barring their repayment.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,51,"Bearing that in mind, the Government contends that the record before the District Court reveals that the Committee used funds raised before the election to repay the first $250,000 of Cruz's loans. For support, it naturally points to appellees' stipulation that none of the $250,000 of the loan that was repaid was from contributions raised after the election. App. 329. Thus, the Government says, the Committee has not yet reached the cap in Section 304 on the use of post-election funds, and can still repay the remaining balance without running afoul of that statutory restriction. It is instead the agency's regulation—with its 20-day limit—that prevents repayment of the final $10,000. This matters, the Government insists, because standing is not dispensed in gross, and plaintiffs must establish standing separately for each claim that they press and each form of relief that they seek. Brief for Appellant 17 (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2208, 210 L.Ed.2d 568 (2021) (slip op., at 15)). A challenge to the regulation, the Government argues, is separate from a challenge to the statute that authorized it.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,52,"For their part, appellees insist that the record, properly interpreted, shows that the Committee used post-election funds to repay Cruz. During the period between election day and when the Committee repaid Cruz's loans, the Committee received more than $250,000 in redesignated contributions to Cruz's 2024 campaign. Those contributions came from individuals who donated to the 2018 election in amounts exceeding their base limit and who, subsequent to the election, redesignated the overlimit amount to the 2024 campaign. See 11 C.F.R. § 110.1(b)(5). Such funds, appellees say, qualify as post-election contributions for purposes of Section 304, and may have been used to repay the first $250,000 of Cruz's loans. See § 116.12(a).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,53,"These arguments have an Alice in Wonderland air about them, with the Government arguing that appellees would not violate the statute by repaying Cruz, and the appellees arguing that they would. But  this case has unfolded in an unusual way. After all, Cruz and the Committee likely would have had standing to bring a pre-enforcement challenge (as they do now) to Section 304 in a much easier manner—by simply alleging and credibly demonstrating that Cruz wished to loan his campaign an amount larger than $250,000, but would not do so only because the loan-repayment limitation made it unlikely that such amount would be repaid. See Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 158-159, 134 S.Ct. 2334. In addition, it ordinarily would not matter whether a plaintiff was challenging the statute's enforcement or instead the enforcement of a regulation and, in doing so, raising arguments about the validity of the statute that authorized the regulation. Cf. Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. ___, ___-___, 141 S.Ct. 1761, 1779-1780, 210 L.Ed.2d 432 (2021). The parties here, however, assume that the distinction makes a difference because the subject-matter jurisdiction of the three-judge District Court is limited to actions challenging the enforcement of the statute. See BCRA § 403(a) (authorizing a three-judge court to hear any action  brought for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge the constitutionality of any provision of this Act or any amendment made by this Act).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,54,"It seems to us that the Government is likely correct that appellees have not shown that they exhausted Section 304's cap on the use of post-election funds. The loan-repayment limitation applies to contributions made after the date of the election. 52 U.S.C. § 30116(j). And a contribution is considered to be made when the contributor relinquishes control over it, which occurs when the contribution is delivered to the Committee or the candidate. 11 C.F.R. § 110.1(b)(6). The redesignated contributions on which appellees now rely, however, involve funds that were delivered to the Committee before the 2018 election. And those funds have remained under the Committee's control from that date, even if they were later redesignated to a different campaign.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,55,"But we need not go further down this rabbit hole. Even under the Government's account, appellees have standing to challenge the threatened enforcement of Section 304. The present inability of the Committee to repay and Cruz to recover the final $10,000 Cruz loaned his campaign is, even if brought about by the agency's threatened enforcement of its regulation, traceable to the operation of Section 304 itself. An agency, after all, literally has no power to act—including under its regulations—unless and until Congress authorizes it to do so by statute. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374, 106 S.Ct. 1890, 90 L.Ed.2d 369 (1986), see also FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 161, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). An agency's regulation cannot operate independently of the statute that authorized it. California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2119-2120, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021). And here, the FEC's 20-day rule was expressly promulgated to implement Section 304. See 68 Fed. Reg. 3973 (2003). Indeed, the Government admitted at oral argument that it could find no other basis to authorize enforcement of this regulation, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, and conceded that the most likely result, if the statute were declared invalid, is that the regulation would cease to be on the books or would cease to be enforceable, ibid. Thus, if Section 304 is invalid and unenforceable—as Cruz and the Committee contend—the agency's 20-day rule is as well. And the remedy appellees sought in the District Court—an order enjoining the Government from taking any action to enforce the loan-repayment limitation, App. 27—would redress appellees' harm by preventing enforcement of the  agency's 20-day rule. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,56,"Contrary to the Government's suggestion, the foregoing analysis does not call into question the principle that a plaintiff injured by one law does not thereby acquire standing to challenge a different law. Brief for Appellant 17. It is true that a litigant cannot, by virtue of his standing to challenge one government action, challenge other governmental actions that did not injure him. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 353, n. 5, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006). Here, however, appellees seek to challenge the one Government action that causes their harm: the FEC's threatened enforcement of the loan-repayment limitation, through its implementing regulation. In doing so, they may raise constitutional claims against Section 304, the statutory provision that, through the agency's regulation, is being enforced. Cf. Collins, 594 U. S., at ___-___, 141 S.Ct., at 1779-1780. Even on the Government's version of the facts, then, we are satisfied that appellees have standing to challenge the threatened enforcement of Section 304. And because they are challenging the constitutionality of a provision of BCRA, § 403(a), jurisdiction was proper in the three-judge District Court. We thus proceed to the merits.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,59,"The First Amendment has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office. Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 28 L.Ed.2d 35 (1971). It safeguards the ability of a candidate to use personal funds to finance campaign speech, protecting his freedom to speak without legislative limit on behalf of his own candidacy. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 54, 96 S.Ct. 612.

2021-040,60,"The Government seems to agree with appellees that the loan-repayment limitation abridges First Amendment rights, at least to some extent, see Brief for Appellant 27-32, and we reach the same conclusion.

See 52 U.S.C. § 30101(9)(A)(i) (defining expenditure to include loans), see also Buckley, 424 U.S. at 52, 96 S.Ct. 612.

That in turn inhibits candidates from loaning money to their campaigns in the first place, burdening core speech.",Roberts,0,

Valta, Debt in Political Campaigns 26 (2020), Record 65-1 (Ovtchinnikov, Debt), see also Brief for United States Senator Roy Blunt et al. as Amici Curiae 6-7. There was no such clustering before the loan-repayment limitation went into effect. The Government's evidence in the District Court, moreover, reflects that the percentage of loans by Senate candidates for exactly $250,000 has increased tenfold since BCRA was passed. See App. 312-313. Section 304, then, has altered the propensity of many politicians to make large loans. Ovtchinnikov, Debt 26, see also Brief for Protect the First Foundation as Amicus Curiae 10-11. In  doing so, it has predictably restricted a candidate's speech on behalf of his own candidacy. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 54, 96 S.Ct. 612.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,62,"Quite apart from this record evidence, the burden on First Amendment expression is evident and inherent in the choice that candidates and their campaigns must confront. Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U.S. 721, 745, 131 S.Ct. 2806, 180 L.Ed.2d 664 (2011), see also id., at 746, 131 S.Ct. 2806 (we do not need empirical evidence to determinate that the law at issue is burdensome), Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n, 554 U.S. 724, 738-740, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (requiring no empirical evidence of a burden). Although Section 304 does not impose a cap on a candidate's expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right. Id., at 738-739, 128 S.Ct. 2759. That penalty, of course, is the significant risk that a candidate will not be repaid if he chooses to loan his campaign more than $250,000. And that risk in turn may deter some candidates from loaning money to their campaigns when they otherwise would, reducing the amount of political speech. This drag on a candidate's First Amendment right to use his own money to facilitate political speech is no less burdensome simply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice. Id., at 739, 128 S.Ct. 2759.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,63,"The drag, moreover, is no small matter. Debt is a ubiquitous tool for financing electoral campaigns. The raw dollar amount of loans made to campaigns in any one election cycle is in the nine figures, significantly exceeding the amount of independent expenditures. Ovtchinnikov, Debt 11. And personal loans from candidates themselves constitute the bulk of this financing. See Brief for Appellant 35 (more than 90% of campaign debt consists of candidate loans). In fact, candidates who self-fund usually do so using personal loans. See J. Steen, Self-Financed Candidates in Congressional Elections 21 (2006).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,64,"The ability to lend money to a campaign is especially important for new candidates and challengers. As a practical matter, personal loans will sometimes be the only way for an unknown challenger with limited connections to front-load campaign spending. See G. Jacobson, Money in Congressional Elections 97-101 (1980). And early spending—and thus early expression —is critical to a newcomer's success. See Steen, Self-Financed Candidates in Congressional Elections, at 35, 171. A large personal loan also may be a useful tool to signal that the political outsider is confident enough in his campaign to have skin in the game, attracting the attention of donors and voters alike. See R. Biersack, P. Herrnson, C. Wilcox, Seeds for Success: Early Money in Congressional Elections, 18 Leg. Studies Q. 535, 537 (1993), see also Brief for United States Senator Roy Blunt et al. as Amici Curiae 13. By inhibiting a candidate from using this critical source of campaign funding, however, Section 304 raises a barrier to entry—thus abridging political speech.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,65,"The dissent cannot and does not claim that Section 304 imposes no burden on candidate speech. See post, at 1659 (opinion of KAGAN, J.) (every contribution regulation has some kind of indirect effect on electoral speech). The dissent instead dismisses that burden as minor and insignificant. Post, at 1658-1660. As just explained, the extent of the burden may vary depending on the circumstances of a particular candidate and particular election. But there is no doubt that the law does burden First Amendment electoral speech, and any such law must at least be justified  by a permissible interest. See McCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm'n, 572 U.S. 185, 210, 134 S.Ct. 1434, 188 L.Ed.2d 468 (2014) (plurality opinion) (When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.).",Roberts,0,

The parties debate whether strict or closely drawn scrutiny should apply in answering that question. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25, 96 S.Ct. 612. We need not resolve this dispute because, under either standard, the Government must prove at the outset that it is in fact pursuing a legitimate objective.

2021-040,69,"This Court has recognized only one permissible ground for restricting political speech: the prevention of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.

We have consistently rejected attempts to restrict campaign speech based on other legislative aims. For example, we have denied attempts to reduce the amount of money in politics, see McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 191, 134 S.Ct. 1434, to level electoral opportunities by equalizing candidate resources, see Bennett, 564 U.S. at 749-750, 131 S.Ct. 2806, and to limit the general influence a contributor may have over an elected official, see Citizens United v.

2021-040,71,"We greet the assertion of an anticorruption interest here with a measure of skepticism, for the loan-repayment limitation is yet another in a long line of prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approaches to regulating campaign finance.

Individual contributions to candidates for federal office, including those made after the candidate has won the election, are already regulated in order to prevent corruption or its appearance. Such contributions are capped at $2,900 per election, see 86 Fed. Reg. 7869, and nontrivial contributions must be publicly disclosed, see 52 U.S.C. §§ 30104(b)(3)(A), (c)(1). The dissent's dire predictions about the impact of today's decision elide the fact that the contributions at issue remain subject to these requirements. See post, at 1657-1658, 1664. And the requirements are themselves prophylactic measures, given that few if any contributions to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements. Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 357, 130 S.Ct. 876.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,72,"Such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach, we have explained, is a significant indicator that the regulation may not be necessary for the interest it seeks to protect.

2021-040,73,"There is no cause for a different conclusion here. Because the Government is defending a restriction on speech as necessary to prevent an anticipated harm, it must do more than simply posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured.

2021-040,74,"Yet the Government is unable to identify a single case of quid pro quo corruption in this context—even though most States do not impose a limit on the use of post-election contributions to repay candidate loans. Cf. Brief for Campaign Legal Center et al. as Amici Curiae 17-18 (citing the 10 States that do impose such a prohibition). Our previous cases have found the absence of such evidence significant.

2021-040,76,"The dissent at points shrugs off this distinction, see post, at 1657, 1662-1663, n. 3, 1663-1664, but our cases make clear that the Government may not seek to limit the appearance of mere influence or access. McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 208, 134 S.Ct. 1434.

2021-040,79,"In the absence of direct evidence, the Government turns elsewhere. It contends that a scholarly article, a poll, and statements by Members of Congress show that these contributions carry a heightened risk of at least the appearance of corruption. Essentially all the Government's evidence, however, concerns the sort of corruption, loosely conceived, that we have repeatedly explained is not legitimately regulated under the First Amendment.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,80,"The academic article—cited for various propositions by both sides—concludes that indebted politicians are more likely to switch their votes if they receive contributions from the banking or insurance industries. Ovtchinnikov, Debt 31. But the authors explicitly note that they cannot distinguish between voting pattern changes traceable to legitimate donor influence or access, and voting pattern changes as part of an illicit quid pro quo. See A. Ovtchinnikov & P. Valta, Self-Funding of Political Campaigns, Management Science, Articles in Advance 18 (April 7, 2022) (Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding). As noted, our precedents demand adherence to that distinction. See, e.g., McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 209, 134 S.Ct. 1434.

Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding 21.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,81,"The online poll the Government asks us to consider similarly misses the mark. The poll, conducted at the Government's behest for this litigation, reports that most respondents thought it very likely or likely that a person who donates money to a candidate's campaign after the election expects a political favor in return. App. 351-352. But it failed to ask whether those same respondents thought it likely that donors who contribute to a campaign before the election also are likely to expect political favors in return. Nor did the poll mention that the individual base limits still apply to such contributions. And it failed to define the term political favor, leaving unclear the critical issue whether the respondents associated such contributions with the direct exchange of money for official acts, which Congress may regulate, or simply increased influence and access, which Congress may not.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,82,"Finally, the Government places great weight on statements made by certain Members of Congress during debates that preceded the enactment of BCRA. One Senator, for example, remarked that without the loan-repayment limitation, a winning candidate who loaned money to his campaign could get it back from his constituents at fundraising events where he could ask, How would you like me to vote now that I am a Senator? 147 Cong. Rec. S2462 (March 19, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Domenici). Another stated that candidates have a constitutional right to try to buy the office, but they do not have a constitutional right to resell it. 147 Cong. Rec. S2541 (March 20, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Hutchison). Nothing these legislators said, however, constitutes actual evidence that the loan-repayment limitation was necessary to prevent quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. And a few stray floor statements are not the same as legislative findings that might suggest a special problem to be addressed. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 518 U.S. at 618, 116 S.Ct. 2309.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,83,"All the above is pretty meager, given that we are considering restrictions on the most fundamental First Amendment activities—the right of candidates for political office to make their case to the American people. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 14, 96 S.Ct. 612. In any event, the legislative  record helps appellees just as much as the Government, given that some Senators evidently viewed the limit as designed to protect incumbents like themselves from wealthy challengers. See 147 Cong. Rec. S2465 (March 19, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Sessions) (Section 304 prohibits wealthy candidates, who incur personal loans in connection with their campaign that exceed $250,000, from repaying those loans from any contributions made to the candidate . I am glad I didn't face a person who could write a check for $60 million, $10 million—or $5 million, for that matter. If so, I would like to be able to have a level playing field so I could stay in the ball game.), see also 147 Cong. Rec. S2541 (March 20, 2001) (remarks of Sen. Hutchison) (Our purpose is to level the playing field.).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,84,"That the limit may have been designed to protect incumbents should come as no surprise. Section 304 was enacted as part of the Millionaire's Amendment to BCRA, designed to hobble wealthy candidates mounting self-financed campaigns. See Davis, 554 U.S. at 739, 128 S.Ct. 2759. And it was debated together with another provision we have already held unconstitutional, in part because it pursued the same impermissible goal of leveling electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth. Id., at 741, 128 S.Ct. 2759. The connection between these two provisions casts further doubt on the anticorruption interest the Government now asserts in this case.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,86,"Perhaps to make up for its evidentiary shortcomings, the Government falls back on what it calls a common sense analogy: Post-election contributions used to repay a candidate's loans are akin to a gift because they add to the candidate's personal wealth as opposed to the campaign's treasury. Brief for Appellant 33. The risk of corruption is thus greater, the Government argues, because the donor is lining the pockets of a legislator or legislator-elect.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,87,"The dissent at multiple points makes the same argument, contending that contributions that go toward repaying a candidate's loan enrich the candidate personally, allowing him to buy a car or make tuition payments or join a country club. Post, at 1660, 1664, see also post, at 1657, 1657 1658, 1660-1661, 1663-1664. But this forgets that we are talking about repayment of a loan, not a gift. If the candidate did not have the money to buy a car before he made a loan to his campaign, repayment of the loan would not change that in any way.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,88,"On top of that, contributions that go toward retiring a candidate's debt could only arguably enrich the candidate if the candidate does not otherwise expect to be repaid. In other words, the Government's gift comparison is meaningful only if the baseline is that the campaign will default. The Government, however, provides no reason to believe that most or even many winning candidates—the only candidates with whom its anticorruption interest is concerned—expect not to be repaid by their campaigns. To the contrary, the Government has recognized throughout this litigation that winning candidates are commonly repaid in full. See App. 31-32 (citing the former FEC Commissioner's statement that only winners have an easy time dealing with debt), id., at 317 (same), see also Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding 11 (concluding that, even with BCRA's limitations on loan repayment in place, two out of three winning campaigns were able to repay a candidate's loans in full). For such a candidate, then, post-election contributions bear little resemblance to a gift, because there is less of a chance that his campaign will default. Such contributions instead restore the candidate to the status quo ante,  a position to which he legitimately expected to return. As for losing candidates, they are of course in no position to grant official favors, and the Government does not provide any anticorruption rationale to explain why post-election contributions to those candidates should be restricted. See Brief for Appellant 45-46.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,89,"The analogy also proves too much. By the Government's logic, post-election contributions to retire candidate loans are little different from gifts given directly to the candidate. But that logic is belied by how the Government treats the two categories of purported gifts. On the one hand, federal law flatly prohibits candidates from using campaign contributions for personal purposes. See 52 U.S.C. § 30114(b)(2). And it forbids Senators from accepting gifts worth $250 or more. See 2 U.S.C. § 4725(a)(1). By contrast, the postulated gift-by-loan-repayment limits are simply the individual contribution limits, which are now more than ten times higher than the gift limit: $2,900 per election. And Section 304 allows over 86 such gifts before a campaign hits the Act's $250,000 cap. Either the Government is openly tolerating a significant number of gifts far more generous than what it would normally think fit to allow, or post-election contributions that go toward retiring campaign debt are in no real sense gifts to a candidate. We find the latter answer more persuasive.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,90,"As a final argument, the Government claims that if the matter is otherwise in doubt, we should defer to Congress's legislative judgment that Section 304 furthers an anticorruption goal. Brief for Appellant 39, see also post, at 1661 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (also arguing that we have no reason to second-guess Congress's experience-based judgment). Such deference, the Government contends, is grounded in part on the understanding that Congress `is far better equipped than the judiciary to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon legislative questions.' Brief for Appellant 40 (quoting Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 137 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). But as explained, the evidence here is scant, and Congress's judgment is hardly based on vast amounts of data. Id., at 195, 117 S.Ct. 1174. Moreover, deference to Congress would be especially inappropriate where, as here, the legislative act may have been an effort to insulate legislators from effective electoral challenge.

2021-040,96,"A candidate for public office extends a $500,000 loan to his campaign organization, hoping to recoup the amount from benefactors' post-election contributions. Once elected, he devotes himself assiduously to recovering the money, his personal bank account, after all, now has a gaping half-million-dollar hole. The politician solicits donations from wealthy individuals and corporate lobbyists, making clear that the money they give will go straight from the campaign to him, as repayment for his loan. He is deeply grateful to those who help, as they know he will be—more grateful than for ordinary campaign contributions (which do not increase his personal wealth). And as they paid him, so he will pay them. In the coming months and years, they receive government benefits— maybe favorable legislation, maybe prized appointments, maybe lucrative contracts. The politician is happy, the donors are happy. The only loser is the public. It inevitably suffers from government corruption.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,97,"The campaign finance measure at issue here has for two decades checked the crooked exchanges just described. The provision, Section 304 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, prohibited a candidate from using post-election donations to repay loans exceeding $250,000 that he made to his campaign. The theory of the legislation is easy to grasp. Political contributions that will line a candidate's own pockets, given after his election to office, pose a special danger of corruption. The candidate has a more-than-usual interest in obtaining the money (to replenish his personal finances), and is now in a position to give something in return. The donors well understand his situation, and are eager to take advantage of it. In short, everyone's incentives are stacked to enhance the risk of dirty dealing. At the very least—even if an illicit exchange does not occur—the public will predictably perceive corruption in post-election payments directly enriching an officeholder. Congress enacted Section 304 to protect against those harms.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,98,"In striking down the law today, the Court greenlights all the sordid bargains Congress thought right to stop. The theory of the decision (unlike of the statute) is hard to fathom. The majority says that Section 304 violates the candidate's First Amendment rights by interfering with his ability to self-fund his campaign. Ante, at 1651. But the candidate can in fact self-fund all he likes. The law impedes only his ability to use other people's money to finance his campaign—much as standard (and permissible) contribution limits do. And even that third-party restriction is a modest one, applying only to post- (not pre-) election donations to repay sizable (not small) loans. So the majority overstates the First Amendment burdens Section 304 imposes. At the same time, the majority understates the anti-corruption values Section 304 serves. In the majority's view, there is scant danger here of quid pro quo corruption, loan repayments produce only the sort of `corruption' in which contributors wield greater influence over candidates than they otherwise would. Ante, at 1653-1654, 1656. Assume away all objections to that distinction, which even the majority concedes is vague, ante, at 1653-1654, for better or worse, it underlies this Court's recent campaign finance decisions. Still, the conduct targeted by Section 304 threatens, if anything does, both corruption and the appearance  of corruption of the quid pro quo kind. That is because the regulated transactions —as Members of Congress well knew from experience—personally enrich those already elected to office. In allowing those payments to go forward unrestrained, today's decision can only bring this country's political system into further disrepute.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,100,"In assessing a law's burden on speech, this Court's decisions all distinguish between restricting expenditures and restricting contributions. See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 19-23, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam). (The majority glosses over that core distinction, for reasons that will soon become clear.) According to settled precedent, expenditure restrictions—caps on a campaign's or candidate's electoral spending—impose the greatest burdens on expression. The First Amendment, as the majority notes, has its fullest and most urgent application when a legislative limit prevents a candidate from using personal funds to finance campaign speech—that is, speech on behalf of his own candidacy. Ante, at 1650 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, laws focused on third-party contributions to a campaign (a category the majority mostly prefers to ignore) typically entail only a marginal restriction on First Amendment interests. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20, 96 S.Ct. 612. Take, for example, a simple limit on the amount someone can donate to a campaign, like the federal $2,900 ceiling. That kind of restriction, we have reasoned, in no way interferes with the donor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues through independent spending. Id., at 1656. And it has only an indirect effect on the campaign itself. To be sure, the cap makes raising money (for speech and other things) harder: It forces candidates to raise funds from a greater number of people and generally results in the campaign taking in less money than it otherwise would. Id., at 1656. But the Court has viewed such limits as troublesome only if they are so low as to prevent candidates from raising the resources necessary for effective advocacy. Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 247, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (plurality opinion) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 21, 96 S.Ct. 612). In the usual case, the incidental effect of a contribution restriction on a campaign's speech does not count as a significant First Amendment burden. See Randall, 548 U.S. at 246-247, 126 S.Ct. 2479.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,101,"Under that precedent, Section 304 entails only a marginal restriction on speech, because it regulates contributions alone. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20, 96 S.Ct. 612. The provision leaves a campaign free to spend any amount of money for speech. Likewise, it leaves the candidate himself— here, Senator Ted Cruz—free to do so. The candidate can (in the majority's words) use personal funds to finance campaign speech without limit, if he wishes, he can devote his whole fortune to speech on behalf of his own candidacy. Ante, at 1650-1651. Section 304 restricts only the use of third-party contributions to support his efforts—which, as just shown, imposes a far more modest First Amendment burden. Recall how Section 304 works: It prevents post-election campaign contributions from going to repay large loans that the candidate has made to his campaign. So the provision limits—much as standard contribution caps do—only the candidate's ability to shift the costs of his electoral speech to others. Or said a bit differently, it addresses not a candidate's self-funding, ante, at 1651, but only his reliance on third-party financing.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,102,"And even that regulation of third-party contributions is a narrow one. Under Section 304, a campaign can always accept  donations for small loans a candidate makes. And it can use pre-election donations to retire even his sizable loans. The statute just insists that donations for that purpose occur when speech is ongoing, and before everyone knows which candidate won (and so is in a position to return the favor by delivering government benefits). Consistent with our caselaw, that minor restriction on a candidate's use of other people's money does not severely burden his (or anyone else's) expression.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,103,"The majority's argument to the contrary focuses not on the restriction Section 304 actually imposes, but on the indirect effects the provision might have. The majority does not dispute that Section 304 places no limits on the amount a candidate can spend for expression. See ante, at 1650-1651. Nor does (or could) the majority even claim that the provision caps what a candidate can lend his campaign. Instead, the majority argues that the law may deter a candidate from making large loans because it curtails a potential source of repayment—i.e., post-election donations. Ante, at 1651. In that way, the majority insists, the law—though concededly regulating only the use of contributions—functions to restrict a candidate's speech. Ante, at 1650-1651, see ante, at 1651-1652.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,104,"But every contribution regulation has some kind of indirect effect on electoral speech, and we have still understood them to impose only minimal burdens. Consider again a standard contribution ceiling, like the federal $2,900 cap. That limit, as we have acknowledged, makes raising money harder. See Randall, 548 U.S. at 247, 126 S.Ct. 2479, Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20-21, 96 S.Ct. 612. And so it predictably gives a campaign less money to spend. (In fact, a lot less: Just think of a world in which a candidate could raise an unlimited sum from every supporter.) With the contribution cap in effect, the campaign cannot pay for (nearly) as many advertisements, mailings, signs, and so forth. And likewise, to return to the fact pattern here, the campaign has less money available than it otherwise would to repay a candidate's (or any other) loans. By the majority's logic, that downstream effect would mean the contribution cap imposes a significant First Amendment burden. But as noted above, we have always held to the contrary, save for the rare case in which the limit is so low as to preclude effective advocacy. See supra, at 1657-1659. There is no reason to treat Section 304 differently. In fact, its restriction on post-election contributions for loan repayment probably has much smaller indirect effects on a campaign's or candidate's speech than the contribution ceilings this Court has approved. (Again, just think of all the multi-million-dollar donations those ceilings prevent.) So the majority's view cannot be right.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,105,"And more fundamentally, the majority fails to appreciate what Section 304 has an indirect effect on: lending, rather than spending, money. In the majority's view, those two activities count as one and the same. See ante, at 1650-1651. But they are not, in an obvious way. The expenditure of personal funds for speech, this Court has observed, reduces the candidate's dependence on donors—precisely because he is not trying to speak on their dime. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 53, 96 S.Ct. 612. The loan of personal funds has the opposite effect, as further shown in this opinion's next part. When a candidate lends substantial funds to his campaign, he wants (maybe desperately needs) them returned, he thus risks—indeed, invites— dependence on donors, who alone can make him financially whole. Section 304 responds to that difference in whether a candidate is speaking independently, or instead relying on others' largesse. The provision at most deters a single mechanism  for financing electoral activities, because it carries a heightened threat of corruption.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,107,"Preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance is a compelling interest by any measure. See Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 496-497, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985). Quid pro quo corruption—which extends beyond criminal bribery to less blatant and specific arrangements—subverts the political process and threatens the integrity of our system of representative democracy. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 388-389, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the appearance of that corruption (though scarcely mentioned in the majority opinion) is of almost equal concern. Id., at 388, 120 S.Ct. 897. Avoiding that appearance is critical if public confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent. Id., at 389, 120 S.Ct. 897.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,108,"Serious dangers of actual and apparent quid pro quo corruption attend the transactions Section 304 regulates—again, the use of post-election contributions to repay a candidate's personal loans. Consider a simple comparison. When a campaign uses a donation to fund routine electoral activities (including speech), the money marginally aids the candidate's electoral odds, but in no way adds to his personal wealth. By contrast, when a campaign uses a donation to repay the candidate's loan, every dollar given goes straight into the candidate's pocket. With each such contribution, his assets increase, he can now buy a car or make tuition payments or join a country club—all with his donors' dollars. So contributions going to loan repayment have exceptional value to the candidate—which his donors of course realize. And when the contributions occur after the election, their corrupting potential further increases. At that time, a campaign can use donations only to repay loans, of which some 97% come from candidates. See 11 C.F.R. 110.1(b)(3)(i) (2017), A. Ovtchinnikov & P. Valta, Self-Funding of Political Campaigns, Management Science, Articles in Advance 5 (Apr. 7, 2022) (Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding). So post-election donors can be confident their money will enrich a candidate personally. And those donors have of course learned which candidate won. When they give money to repay the victor's loan, they know—not merely hope—he will be in a position to perform official favors. The recipe for quid pro quo corruption is thus in place: a donation to enhance the candidate's own wealth (the quid), made when he has become able to use the power of public office to the donor's advantage (the quo). The heightened threat of corruption —and, even more, of its appearance— is self-evident (except, it seems, to observers allergic to all campaign finance regulation).",Roberts,0,
2021-040,109,"In addressing that special danger, Section 304 is anything but a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis, as the majority labels it. Ante, at 1652. The idea behind that fancy-sounding epithet is just that the statute is a needless precaution: The $2,900 contribution ceiling, the majority asserts, already provides generous protection against the corrupting potential of donations, so the loan-repayment provision is unnecessary. See ibid. But that claim ignores that Section 304 targets only a subset of contributions, which raise (as just described) unique corruption risks. When an added protection addresses an added danger, the existence of a basic protection (however ordinarily ample) fails to show the supplement's pointlessness. Regular seatbelts might suffice to protect drivers on the interstate, but special belts—and  roll cages to boot—are essential measures on the racetrack. So too, a $2,900 cap might suffice to prevent corruption from normal campaign contributions—but not from post-election contributions to repay a candidate's loan, and thus to enrich him personally. When Congress, as here, responds to a heightened threat with a heightened safeguard, the majority has no call to greet it with a measure of skepticism. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,110,"Nor does the majority have reason to second-guess Congress's experience-based judgment about the specially corrupting effects of post-election donations to repay candidate loans. The majority's first attempt to counter that judgment is that we are only talking about repayment of a loan: If the candidate did not have the money to buy a car before he made a loan to his campaign, repayment of the loan would not change that in any way. Ante, at 1655. But that altogether misses the point. However much money the candidate had before he makes a loan to his campaign, he has less after it: The amount of the loan is the size of the hole in his bank account. So whatever he could buy with, say, $250,000—surely a car, but that's beside the point—he cannot buy any longer. Until, that is, donors pay him back. Then, the hole is filled, the bank account replenished, and the purchasing power restored. That is a significant financial gain to the officeholder, courtesy of donors. If they had not stepped up, the officeholder would have been $250,000 poorer.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,111,"The majority's second theory fares no better. Contributions to repay loans, the majority argues, do not really enrich an officeholder, because he has, from the beginning, expected to be repaid. Ante, at 1655. But the record provides no support for that self-assured statement. Contra the majority, the Government has recognized throughout this litigation not that winning candidates are usually repaid, but only that they are repaid more often than losing ones. Ibid., see App. 31-32, 317.1 That is no surprise—and the fact is affirmatively unhelpful for the majority's position, because it shows how post-election donations reflect an expectation of payback from the recipient. Nothing else in the record (or outside it) is helpful to the majority either. The best empirical study suggests that a substantial portion of winning campaigns fail to retire candidate loans, even when their amounts are too small to trigger Section 304's restrictions. See Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding 11, see also Brief for Campaign Legal Center et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13 (summarizing research showing that most campaigns fail to pay off candidates' personal loans in any amount at any time, in confirmation of the conventional wisdom that post-election fundraising is notoriously difficult). So a candidate with a loan outstanding has plenty of reason to feel anxious—and to see the loan's repayment as a gratitude-inducing personal benefit. The donor takes him off a sharp hook. And even a candidate who expects repayment is far from impervious to corruption. He may have  that confidence exactly because he knows that a raft of lobbyists will be eager to pay for political benefits. And with his bank account depleted, he has a great temptation to perform his part in such an exchange.2",Roberts,0,
2021-040,112,"The common sense of Section 304—the obviousness of the theory behind it—lessens the need for the Government to identify past cases of quid pro quo corruption involving candidate loan repayments. As this Court has made clear, the quantum of empirical evidence needed to sustain a campaign finance law varies up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the law's justification. McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U.S. 93, 144, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). There is nothing novel or implausible about Section 304's rationale—once again, that payments going to line an elected official's pockets pose an especial risk of corruption. It is in fact what everyone knows to be true— because everyone knows people (including politicians) will often do things for money. The majority suggests that we should discard our understanding of how the world works because the Government has not come forward with adjudicated instances of corruption in the loan-repayment context. See ante, at 1652-1654. But quid pro quo exchanges, in that and every other setting, are nigh-impossible to detect and prove. That is indeed why we have campaign finance laws like Section 304. They prohibit conduct posing a heightened risk of corruption, so that the Government does not have to ferret out illicit exchanges case by case by case. To strike down Section 304 because the Government has not proved to a certainty some number of loan-repayments-for-political-paybacks is to miss the provision's essential point.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,113,"In any event, the Government and its amici have marshalled significant evidence showing that the loan repayments Section 304 targets have exactly the dangers Congress thought. See Brief for Appellant 37-40, Brief for Campaign Legal Center et al. 27-29. Here is a sampling from the record, involving jurisdictions unprotected by either Section 304 or a state equivalent. In Ohio, various law firms donated almost $200,000 to help the newly elected attorney general recoup his personal loans. Those donors later received more than 200 state contracts worth nearly $10 million in legal fees. See L. Bischoff, Donations Helping DeWine Pay Down Campaign Loan, Springfield News-Sun, Feb. 2, 2012, p. A1. In Alaska, a lobbyist collected almost $100,000 for post-election repayment of the Governor's personal loans. A business in which he held an interest later received a $9 million state contract. See B. Curry, Alaska Gov. Sheffield's Impeachment Inquiry Has Overtones of Watergate Scandal, L. A. Times, July 19, 1985, p. 11. In Kentucky, two Governors loaned their campaigns millions of dollars, only to be repaid after the election by contributors seeking no-bid contracts. J. Moore, Campaign Finance Reform in Kentucky: The  Race for Governor, 85 Ky. L. J. 723, 746 (1997). The scandal those transactions created led to a new state campaign-finance law similar to Section 304. In upholding that statute, a court more cognizant than this one about how corruption works explained that heavily indebted candidates were easy bedfellows for quid pro quo contributors. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F.Supp. 916, 930 (W.D. Ky. 1995). That is also true on the local level. In San Diego, to take just one instance, three city council members cast critical votes benefiting lobbyists who had raised funds to retire their campaign debts. See C. Gustafson, Lobbyists See Benefit From Three City Officials, San Diego Union-Tribune, June 13, 2009, p. A1.3",Roberts,0,
2021-040,114,"An empirical study in the record confirms the dangers of corruption shown in those examples. The study first found, based on data preceding Section 304's enactment, that politicians carrying campaign debt were significantly more likely than their debt-free counterparts to switch their votes after receiving contributions from special interests. A. Ovtchinnikov & P. Valta, Debt in Political Campaigns (2020), in No. 1:19-cv-00908 (D DC, July 14, 2020), ECF Doc. 65-1, p. 31. In other words, officeholders did more in exchange for donations repaying their personal loans than for other donations. The analysis next looked at Section 304's effect. Here, the data showed that politicians with debt exceeding the law's $250,000 threshold became significantly less responsive to contributions than before: They began to behave remarkably similar to their debt free counterparts. Id., at 28, see Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding 3 (similarly stating that those politicians became more independent of contributions from special interests). In other words, Section 304 did just what Congress thought it would. By preventing post-election contributions from personally enriching politicians, the provision diminished donor-responsive voting. The majority tries to undermine those findings by quoting the kind of careful caveats always accompanying good social science. See ante, at 1654, Ovtchinnikov, Self-Funding 21 (noting that the study is a first step in understanding and that more work is needed to fully pin down all aspects of causation). But the authors are confident—and rightly so—in the findings just described: that Section 304 markedly decreased the frequency with which officeholders voted as donors would like. And although the authors could not responsibly claim that all the shifted votes they tallied were part of quid pro quo deals—they are, after all, professors, not the FBI—they deduce from the data that politicians carrying campaign debt were less likely to be selling access than to be selling votes. Id., at 18.",Roberts,0,
2021-040,115,"Finally, the record evidence addresses the almost equally important matter of the appearance of corruption. Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S. at 390, 120 S.Ct. 897, see supra, at 1659-1660. A Government-commissioned survey of public opinion found that 81% of respondents believed it very  likely or likely that a person who donates money to a candidate's campaign after the election expects a political favor in return. App. 351-353. That bears repeating: 81%—an overwhelming perception across all demographic categories, as well as across all party affiliations and political ideologies. See ibid. As the court reviewing the Kentucky version of Section 304 explained: There is an impression when a contribution repays a loan after an election that the contributor is simply lining the candidate's pocket, as there is no ongoing campaign to which the contribution may be made. Wilkinson, 876 F.Supp. at 930, see supra, at 1662-1663. The majority flyspecks the polling questions: Why didn't the poll define political favor? Did the poll mention that the contributions had to comply with the $2,900 cap? And so forth. See ante, at 1654-1655. But really—is it likely that such tinkering would have made a real difference? The poll results were so lopsided because the post-election contributions Section 304 targets —ones adding to the candidate's personal wealth—have so conspicuous a potential to corrupt. The public knows that to be true. The public's representatives in Congress knew it to be true. Only this Court—somehow—does not.* * *",Roberts,0,
2021-040,116,"Democracy works only if the people have faith in those who govern. Shrink Missouri, 528 U.S. at 390, 120 S.Ct. 897 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the people cannot have faith in representatives who trade official acts for financial gain. Section 304 prevents that kind of corruption, at barely discernable cost to First Amendment freedoms. The provision limits one narrow use of third-party contributions to a campaign, thus entailing only a marginal restriction on speech. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20, 96 S.Ct. 612. And the provision targets a practice posing exceptional risks of quid pro quo deals. Repaying a candidate's loan after he has won election cannot serve the usual purposes of a contribution: The money comes too late to aid in any of his campaign activities. All the money does is enrich the candidate personally at a time when he can return the favor—by a vote, a contract, an appointment. It takes no political genius to see the heightened risk of corruption—the danger of I'll make you richer and you'll make me richer arrangements between donors and officeholders. Section 304 has guarded against that threat for two decades, but no longer. In discarding the statute, the Court fuels non-public-serving, self-interested governance. It injures the integrity, both actual and apparent, of the political process. I respectfully dissent.",Roberts,0,
2021-041,34,"There is a longstanding tradition in American law, dating back to the dawn of the Republic, that a judge at sentencing considers the whole person before him or her as an individual. Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). In line with this history, federal courts today generally exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to craft appropriate sentences. Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337  (1949). When a defendant appears for sentencing, the sentencing court considers the defendant on that day, not on the date of his offense or the date of his conviction. Pepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 492, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). Similarly, when a defendant's sentence is set aside on appeal, the district court at resentencing can (and in many cases, must) consider the defendant's conduct and changes in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines since the original sentencing. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,35,Congress enacted the First Step Act of 2018 against that backdrop. The First Step Act authorizes district courts to reduce the prison sentences of defendants convicted of certain offenses involving crack cocaine. The Act allows a district court to impose a reduced sentence as if the revised penalties for crack cocaine enacted in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 were in effect at the time the offense was committed. The question in this case is whether a district court adjudicating a motion under the First Step Act may consider other intervening changes of law (such as changes to the Sentencing Guidelines) or changes of fact (such as behavior in prison) in adjudicating a First Step Act motion.,Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,36,"The Court holds that they may. It is only when Congress or the Constitution limits the scope of information that a district court may consider in deciding whether, and to what extent, to modify a sentence, that a district court's discretion to consider information is restrained. Nothing in the First Step Act contains such a limitation. Because district courts are always obligated to consider nonfrivolous arguments presented by the parties, the First Step Act requires district courts to consider intervening changes when parties raise them. By its terms, however, the First Step Act does not compel courts to exercise their discretion to reduce any sentence based on those arguments.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,37,"The District Court in this case declined to consider petitioner Carlos Concepcion's arguments that intervening changes of law and fact supported his motion, erroneously believing that it did not have the discretion to do so, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court now reverses.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,40,"In 2007, Concepcion pleaded guilty to one count of distributing five or more grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (2006 ed.). Concepcion admitted that he sold 13.8 grams of crack cocaine, and he was sentenced in 2009 to 19 years (228 months) in prison. Two features of his sentencing are relevant here. First, Concepcion was sentenced under a scheme that created a 100-to-1 disparity between crack-cocaine and powder-cocaine offenders. At the time Concepcion was sentenced, an offense involving five or more grams of crack cocaine resulted in a statutory sentencing range of 5 to 40 years' imprisonment, it required 100 times as much powder cocaine to trigger the same penalties. Second, when Concepcion was initially sentenced, he qualified as a career offender. The career offender provision, together with other enhancements, increased Concepcion's Guidelines range from 57 to 71 months to 262 to 327 months.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,41,"Both of these features of Concepcion's sentencing have since been altered. Just one year after Concepcion was sentenced, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 to correct the harsh disparities between crack and powder cocaine sentencing. Section 2 of that Act increased the amount of crack cocaine needed to trigger the 5-to-40-year sentencing range  from 5 grams to 28 grams. § 2(a)(2), 124 Stat. 2372. The Sentencing Commission then retroactively amended the Sentencing Guidelines to lower the Guidelines range for crack-cocaine offenses, but that amendment did not benefit all prisoners serving sentences handed down during the 100-to-1 regime. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual App. C, Amdt. 750 (Supp. Nov. 2011) (USSG). Concepcion was not eligible for retroactive relief under that 2011 Sentencing Commission's amendment because he was sentenced under the career offender enhancement, but he became eligible to have his sentence reduced in 2018, when Congress passed the First Step Act. The First Step Act authorized district courts to impose a reduced sentence for qualifying movants as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act  were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.

He argued that he was serving a sentence for a covered offense because § 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act modified the statutory penalties for his conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Concepcion contended that retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act lowered his Guidelines range from 262 to 327 months to 188 to 235 months. The Government conceded Concepcion's eligibility for relief and his calculation of the Guidelines but opposed the motion, emphasizing that Concepcion's original sentence of 228 months fell within the new Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. While recognizing Concepcion's participation in various programs in prison, the Government detailed troubling behaviors such as `fighting (12/19/2017), Interfering with Staff (11/15/2012), and Possession of a Weapon' in Concepcion's prison records that, in the Government's view, counseled against a sentence reduction.

2021-041,44,"In his reply brief, represented by counsel, Concepcion made two primary arguments in support of a reduced sentence. First, he argued that he would no longer be considered a career offender under the amended Guidelines, because one of his prior convictions had been vacated and his remaining convictions would no longer be considered crimes of violence that trigger the enhancement.1 Without the career offender enhancement, Concepcion argued that his revised Guidelines range should be 57 to 71 months. Second, Concepcion pointed to postsentencing evidence of rehabilitation. Concepcion highlighted his successfully completed drug and vocational programming, as well as his stable reentry plan. He also submitted a letter from a Bureau of Prisons chaplain who attested to Concepcion's spiritual growth while incarcerated.",Sotomayor,0,

S. 62, 66, 137 S.Ct. 1170, 197 L.Ed.2d 490 (2017).3  This history dates back to before the founding: Both before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law. Williams, 337 U.S., at 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079. Early state and English courts broadly recognized this discretion. See, e.g., Rex v. Bunts, 2 T. R. 683, 100 Eng. Rep. 368 (K. B. 1788) (When any defendant shall be brought up for sentence on any indictment the court shall hear evidence from the prosecution and the defense in determining an appropriate sentence), State v. Summers, 98 N.C. 702, 705, 4 S.E. 120, 121 (1887) (It was competent for the trial judge to hear such evidence as he might deem necessary and proper to aid his judgment and discretion in determining the punishment to be imposed), State v. Reeder, 79 S.C. 139, 141, 60 S.E. 434, 435 (1908) (rejecting claim that trial court erred in considering aggravating evidence at sentencing, and explaining that the circuit judge merely permitted himself to be informed as to the character of the accused and the circumstances of the crime, so that he might be able to exercise his discretion intelligently and pronounce a just sentence).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,52,"That unbroken tradition characterizes federal sentencing history as well. Federal judges exercising sentencing discretion have always considered a wide variety of aggravating and mitigating factors relating to the circumstances of both the offense and the offender. Stith & Cabranes 14. Indeed, it has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue. Koon, 518 U.S., at 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035, see, e.g., United States v. Randall, 27 F.Cas. 696, 708 (No. 16,118) (D.C. Ore. 1869) (considering the defendant's former good reputation in imposing sentence), United States v. Nye, 27 F.Cas. 210, 211 (No. 15,906) (C.C. Mass. 1855) (considering palliating circumstances, including that the defendants were sober, and fit for duty, in imposing sentence), Lyon's Case, 15 F.Cas. 1183, 1185 (No. 8,646) (CC Vt. 1798) (considering the reduced condition of the defendant's estate in imposing sentence). Accordingly, a federal judge in deciding to impose a sentence may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,54,"The discretion federal judges hold at initial sentencings also characterizes sentencing modification hearings. Relying on Williams and Koon, the Court in Pepper found it clear that when a defendant's sentence has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for resentencing, a district court may consider evidence of a defendant's rehabilitation since his prior sentencing. 562 U.S., at 490, 131 S.Ct. 1229. Pepper reached that conclusion in light of the federal sentencing framework that allows sentencing judges to consider the `fullest information possible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics.' Id., at 488, 490, 131 S.Ct. 1229.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,55,"Accordingly, federal courts resentencing individuals whose sentences were vacated on appeal regularly consider evidence of rehabilitation developed after the initial sentencing. See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 2020 WL 2521551, *5 (SDNY, May 18, 2020) (considering the movant's exemplary conduct during a lengthy period of incarceration), United States v. Raifsnider, 2020 WL 1503527, *3 (D Kan., Mar. 30, 2020) (considering that the movant has completed his GED, taken hundreds of hours of programming offered by the Bureau of Prisons, and is taking college classes). Similarly, district courts in resentencing proceedings frequently consider evidence of violence and rule breaking in prison. See, e.g., United States v. Riley, 785 Fed.Appx. 282, 285 (C.A.6 2019) (considering a `series of disciplinary violations while in the Bureau of Prisons'), United States v. Diaz, 486 Fed.Appx. 979, 980 (C.A.3 2012) (considering infractions while in prison, e.g., possession of marijuana).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,56,"Where district courts must calculate new Guidelines ranges as part of resentencing proceedings, courts have also considered unrelated Guidelines changes in their discretion. See, e.g., United States v. Frates, 896 F.3d 93, 101-102 (C.A.1 2018) (distinguishing between recalculating a Guidelines range based on nonretroactive intervening changes of law and considering those changes as a matter of discretion to select an appropriate sentence), United States v. Taylor, 648 F.3d 417, 425 (C.A.6 2011) (The district court can consider subsequent amendments to the Guidelines for purposes of fashioning an appropriate sentence at resentencing), United States v. Gilmore, 599 F.3d 160, 166-167 (C.A.2 2010) (considering subsequently updated Guidelines as evidence of society's judgment of the seriousness of the movant's offense). In many cases, a district court is prohibited from recalculating a Guidelines range in light of nonretroactive Guidelines amendments, but the court may find those amendments to be germane when deciding whether to modify a sentence at all, and if so, to what extent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,58,"The only limitations on a court's discretion to consider any relevant materials at an initial sentencing or in modifying that sentence are those set forth by Congress in a statute or by the Constitution. See Pepper, 562 U.S., at 489, n. 8, 131 S.Ct. 1229 (Of course, sentencing courts' discretion  is subject to constitutional constraints), Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 364, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989) (The scope of judicial discretion with respect to a sentence is subject to congressional control).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,59,"Congress is not shy about placing such limits where it deems them appropriate. At an initial sentencing, Congress has provided generally that no limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense when deciding what sentence to impose. 18 U.S.C. § 3661. Congress has, however, expressly prohibited a district court in crafting an initial sentence from considering a defendant's need for rehabilitation in support of a prison sentence. See § 3582(a), Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 328, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,60,"In other aspects of sentencing, Congress also has expressly limited district courts to considering only certain factors. For example, in determining whether to include a term of supervised release, and the length of any such term, Congress has expressly precluded district courts from considering the need for retribution. See § 3583(c), id., at 326, 131 S.Ct. 2382.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,61,Congress has further imposed express statutory limitations on one type of sentencing modification proceeding. Section 3582(c)(2) provides that,Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,62,"in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission  the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,63,"For those proceedings, Congress expressly cabined district courts' discretion by requiring courts to abide by the Sentencing Commission's policy statements. See also § 3582(c)(1)(A) (permitting district courts to grant compassionate release in certain circumstances if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission).4",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,66,"Congress in the First Step Act simply did not contravene this well-established sentencing practice. Nothing in the text and structure of the First Step Act expressly, or even implicitly, overcomes the established tradition of district courts' sentencing discretion.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,67,"The first section of the First Step Act, § 404(a), sets out who is eligible for relief:",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,68,"In this section, the term `covered offense' means a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010  that was committed before August 3, 2010. 132 Stat. 5222.",Sotomayor,0,

Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a court to reduce any sentence pursuant to this section. 132 Stat. 5222.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,73,"The text of the First Step Act does not so much as hint that district courts are prohibited from considering evidence of rehabilitation, disciplinary infractions, or unrelated Guidelines changes. The only two limitations on district courts' discretion appear in § 404(c): A district court may not consider a First Step Act motion if the movant's sentence was already reduced  under the Fair Sentencing Act or if the court considered and rejected a motion under the First Step Act. Neither of those limitations applies here. By its terms, § 404(c) does not prohibit district courts from considering any arguments in favor of, or against, sentence modification. In fact, § 404(c) only underscores that a district court is not required to modify a sentence for any reason. Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate in the sentencing context, for Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 103, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).5",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,74,"Nor did Congress hide any limitations on district courts' discretion outside of § 404(c). Section 404(b) does not erect any additional such limitations. The term as if simply enacts the First Step Act's central goal: to make retroactive the changes in the Fair Sentencing Act. That language is necessary to overcome 1 U.S.C. § 109, which creates a presumption that Congress does not repeal federal criminal penalties unless it says so expressly. To defeat the presumption established by this statute, Congress needed to make clear that the Fair Sentencing Act applied retroactively. Notably, the as if clause requires a district court to apply the Fair Sentencing Act as if it applied at the time of the commission of the offense, not at the time of the original sentencing. Had Congress intended to constrain district courts to consider only the record as it existed at the time of the original sentencing, Congress would have written the as if clause to refer to that sentencing, not the commission of the offense. Thus, the language Congress enacted in the First Step Act specifically requires district courts to apply the legal changes in the Fair Sentencing Act when calculating the Guidelines if they chose to modify a sentence.6 The as if clause does not, however, limit the information a district court may use to inform its decision whether and how much to reduce a sentence.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,76,"Consistent with this text and structure, district courts deciding First Step Act motions regularly have considered evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation and unrelated Guidelines amendments when raised by  the parties. By definition, First Step Act movants have amassed prison records of over a decade. See § 404(a), 132 Stat. 5222 (requiring the movant to have been sentenced for an offense committed before August 3, 2010). Those records are naturally of interest to judges authorized by the First Step Act to reduce prison sentences or even to release movants immediately. See, e.g., United States v. Crawford, 483 F.Supp.3d 378, 381 (N.D. W. Va. 2020) (considering that the movant earned his GED in prison, obtained a carpentry certification through a local community college, and was sanctioned for only two minor write-ups in the nine years preceding his motion), United States v. Henderson, 399 F.Supp.3d 648, 656 (W.D. La. 2019) (considering that the movant had not seen his children in eight years, that he had possible employment opportunities  upon his release, and that he had received only two incident reports while incarcerated), United States v. Mitchell, 2019 WL 2647571, *8 (D DC, June 27, 2019) (considering that the movant incurred no disciplinary infractions over his last fourteen years in prison and that the movant would no longer be considered a career offender based on an intervening change of law).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,77,"Likewise, when deciding whether to grant First Step Act motions and in deciding how much to reduce sentences, courts have looked to postsentencing evidence of violence or prison infractions as probative. See, e.g., United States v. Rose, 841 Fed. Appx. 328, 329 (C.A.2 2021) (affirming partial denial of motion where the district court relied on the movant's lengthy history of prison disciplinary infractions, which included many recent violent infractions), United States v. Barlow, 544 F.Supp.3d 491, 505 (N.J. 2021) (considering, in denying motion, that the movant was disciplined in prison seven times, including three times for possessing a dangerous weapon, once for possessing marijuana, and once for fighting), United States v. Slutzkin, 2019 WL 5696122, *8 (Conn., Nov. 4, 2019) (considering in denying motion the movant's behavior once incarcerated as perhaps the greatest concern to the Court, in light of 25 disciplinary citations while in state incarceration and six more in federal prison).7",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,78,"Moreover, when raised by the parties, district courts have considered nonretroactive Guidelines amendments to help inform whether to reduce sentences at all, and if so, by how much. See, e.g., United States v. Coachman, 2020 WL 6939890, *3 (ND Fla., June 22, 2020) (considering that the movant would not qualify for career offender status at the time of his sentence modification hearing), United States v. Frederick, 2020 WL 555302, *4 (WD Pa., Feb. 4, 2020) (considering the fact that the movant would not qualify as a career offender under the current version of the career offender provisions  as a factor favoring the exercise of the discretionary relief that may be awarded), United States v. Newton, 2019 WL 1007100, *5 (WD Va., Mar. 1, 2019) (considering that the movant, if he were sentenced today, would no longer qualify for career offender status). Nothing express or implicit in the First Step Act suggests that these courts misinterpreted the Act in considering such relevant and probative information.8  C",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,79,The Court therefore holds that the First Step Act allows district courts to consider intervening changes of law or fact in exercising their discretion to reduce a sentence pursuant to the First Step Act.,Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,80,"It follows, under the Court's sentencing jurisprudence, that when deciding a First Step Act motion, district courts bear the standard obligation to explain their decisions and demonstrate that they considered the parties' arguments. It is well established that a district court must generally consider the parties' nonfrivolous arguments before it. See Golan v. Saada, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1880, 1893, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022). Of course, a district court is not required to be persuaded by every argument parties make, and it may, in its discretion, dismiss arguments that it does not find compelling without a detailed explanation. Nor is a district court required to articulate anything more than a brief statement of reasons. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Nothing in the First Step Act contravenes those background principles.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,81,"When it comes to that reasoned explanation, the First Step Act `leaves much  to the judge's own professional judgment.' Chavez-Meza v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 1959, 1961, 201 L.Ed.2d 359 (2018) (quoting Rita, 551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456). The First Step Act does not require courts to expressly rebut each argument made by the parties. United States v. Maxwell, 991 F.3d 685, 694 (C.A.6 2021). In exercising its discretion, the court is free to agree or disagree with any of the policy arguments raised before it. Cf. Kimbrough, 552 U.S., at 111, 128 S.Ct. 558. All that the First Step Act requires is that a district court make clear that it reasoned through the parties' arguments. 991 F.3d, at 693.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,82,"The broad discretion that the First Step Act affords to district courts also counsels in favor of deferential appellate review. As a general matter, it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence. Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290, n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983). Section 404(c) of the First Step Act confers particular discretion, clarifying that the Act does not require a court to reduce any sentence. Other than legal errors in recalculating the Guidelines to account for the Fair Sentencing Act's changes, see Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), appellate review should not be overly searching.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-041,83,"Put simply, the First Step Act does not require a district court to accept a movant's argument that evidence of rehabilitation  or other changes in law counsel in favor of a sentence reduction, or the Government's view that evidence of violent behavior in prison counsels against providing relief. Nor does the First Step Act require a district court to make a point-by-point rebuttal of the parties' arguments. All that is required is for a district court to demonstrate that it has considered the arguments before it.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

In 2010, Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act to narrow that crack/powder disparity by lowering the sentencing ranges for certain crack-cocaine offenses. But the Act lowered those crack-cocaine sentencing ranges only prospectively—that is, for crack-cocaine offenders who were sentenced on or after the Act's effective date of August 3, 2010.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,88,"The First Step Act of 2018 changed that. It provided that the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act's lower crack-cocaine sentencing ranges would also apply retroactively to offenders who were sentenced before August 3, 2010. But how to implement that change? Congress did not mandate a specific across-the-board reduction to all pre-August 3, 2010, crack-cocaine sentences. Instead, the First Step Act authorized district courts, on motion, to impose a reduced sentence as if the lower sentencing ranges for crack-cocaine offenses were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed. § 404(b), 132 Stat. 5222.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,89,"The straightforward question in this case is whether district courts in First Step Act sentence-modification proceedings may reduce sentences based not only on the changes to the crack-cocaine sentencing ranges, but also on other unrelated legal or factual changes that have occurred since the original sentencing. For many crack-cocaine offenders who were sentenced before August 3, 2010, the most significant such change is a non-retroactive 2016 Sentencing Guidelines amendment that substantially altered the career-offender guideline and would significantly lower many of those offenders' Guidelines ranges. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, App. C, Amdt. 798 (Nov. 2021).",Kavanaugh,0,

2021-041,91,"I respectfully disagree. The text of the First Step Act authorizes district courts to reduce sentences based only on changes to the crack-cocaine sentencing ranges, not based on other unrelated changes that have occurred since the original sentencing. In other words, the First Step Act directs district courts to answer one fundamental question: What would the offender's sentence have been if the lower crack-cocaine sentencing ranges had been in effect  back at the time of the original sentencing?",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,92,"The Court sidesteps the text of the Act and equates sentence-modification proceedings with plenary sentencing proceedings. But as this Court has recognized, there are fundamental differences between sentencing and sentence-modification proceedings. Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 830, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The finality of criminal judgments is essential to the operation of the criminal justice system. See Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555-556, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998), United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 166, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Once a federal sentence becomes final, a court may alter that sentence only in very limited circumstances. Pepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 501-502, n. 14, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011).

2021-041,93,"The First Step Act states that the district court may  impose a reduced sentence as if the lower sentencing ranges for crack-cocaine offenses were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed. § 404(b), 132 Stat. 5222. By its terms, the First Step Act authorizes consideration only of the lower sentencing ranges for crack-cocaine offenses. The First Step Act does not authorize consideration of unrelated intervening legal or factual changes. Indeed, the relevant provision of the First Step Act does not mention changes other than the lower sentencing ranges for crack-cocaine offenses. Therefore, the First Step Act does not expressly permit reductions based on those unrelated intervening changes. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(B).",Kavanaugh,0,

Those cases therefore do not support the Court's approach here. To reiterate, for sentence-modification proceedings, Congress has declared that courts may reduce a sentence only as expressly permitted by statute. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(B). And the First Step Act does not authorize consideration of unrelated intervening legal or factual changes since the original sentencing.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,95,"The Court's disregard of the text of the First Step Act and § 3582(c)(1)(B) will create significant and inexplicable sentencing inequities. Consider the following. First Step Act sentence-modification proceedings are available only for offenders who were sentenced before August 3, 2010. So a crack-cocaine offender such as Concepcion who was sentenced before August 3, 2010, may now obtain the benefit of the non-retroactive 2016 change to the career-offender guideline. But a crack-cocaine offender who was sentenced from August 3, 2010, to July 31, 2016, will not be able to obtain the benefit of the non-retroactive 2016 change to the career-offender guideline. What sense does that make? That anomalous outcome will amount to a haphazard windfall for crack-cocaine offenders sentenced before August 3, 2010. United States v. Lancaster, 997 F.3d 171, 180 (C.A.4 2021) (Wilkinson, J., concurring in judgment).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,96,"Still more inequities will ensue because the Court affords district courts blanket discretion to choose between two vastly  different approaches to First Step Act proceedings. To be sure, the Court properly notes that district courts must begin a First Step Act proceeding by calculating the new Guidelines range based solely on the changes to the crack-cocaine sentencing ranges. See ante, at 2402, n. 6. So far, so good. But district courts then have free rein either to take into account—or to completely disregard—other intervening changes since the original sentencing.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,97,"Needless to say, different district courts will choose different approaches. The Court's decision will therefore produce massive inequities in how the First Step Act is implemented on the ground. Those inequities further illustrate why today's decision is wrong as a matter of statutory interpretation: Congress enacted the First Step Act to provide a targeted retroactive reduction in crack-cocaine sentencing ranges, not to unleash a sentencing free-for-all in the lower courts.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-041,98,"The Court's disregard of the text of the First Step Act is especially audacious because the Act was a heavily negotiated and vigorously debated piece of legislation. The Act reflects a compromise among competing interests. Not for the first time in a sentencing case, the Court's decision today unravels the legislative compromise reflected in the statutory text. The Court in effect green-lights district courts, if they wish, to make the 2016 amendment to the career-offender guideline retroactive in First Step Act proceedings—even though neither Congress nor the Sentencing Commission has made that amendment retroactive. Perhaps the Court's decision represents better sentencing policy. Perhaps not. But under the Constitution's separation of powers, this Court may not simply rewrite the First Step Act as the Court thinks best.",Kavanaugh,0,

That standard may be different for new and existing plants, but in each case it must reflect the best system of emission reduction that the Agency has determined to be adequately demonstrated for the particular category. §§ 7411(a)(1), (b)(1), (d). For existing plants, the States then implement that requirement by issuing rules restricting emissions from sources within their borders.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,57,"Since passage of the Act 50 years ago, EPA has exercised this authority by setting performance standards based on measures that would reduce pollution by causing plants to operate more cleanly. In 2015, however, EPA issued a new rule concluding that the best system of emission reduction for existing coal-fired power plants included a requirement that such facilities reduce their own production of electricity, or subsidize increased generation by natural gas, wind, or solar sources.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,58,The question before us is whether this broader conception of EPA's authority is within the power granted to it by the Clean Air Act.,Roberts,0,
2021-045,61,"The Clean Air Act establishes three main regulatory programs to control air pollution from stationary sources such as power plants. Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1676, 42 U. S. C. § 7401 et seq. One program is the New Source Performance Standards program of Section 111, at issue here. The other two are the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program, set out in Sections 108 through 110 of the Act, 42 U. S. C. §§ 7408-7410, and the Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) program, set out in Section 112, § 7412. To understand the place and function of Section 111 in the statutory scheme, some background on the other two programs is in order.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,62,"The NAAQS program addresses air pollutants that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, and the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources. § 7408(a)(1). After identifying such pollutants, EPA establishes a NAAQS for each. The NAAQS represents the maximum airborne concentration of the pollutant that the public health can tolerate. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 465, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001), see § 7409(b). EPA, though, does not choose which sources must reduce their pollution and by how much to meet the ambient pollution target. Instead, Section 110 of the Act leaves that task in the first instance to the States, requiring each to submit to EPA a plan designed to implement and maintain such standards within its boundaries. Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 65, 95 S.Ct. 1470, 43 L.Ed.2d 731 (1975), § 7410.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,63,"The second major program governing stationary sources is the HAP program. The HAP program primarily targets pollutants, other than those already covered by a NAAQS, that present a threat of adverse human health effects, including substances known or anticipated to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, or otherwise acutely or chronically toxic. § 7412(b)(2).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,64,"EPA's regulatory role with respect to these toxic pollutants is different in kind from its role in administering the NAAQS program. There, EPA is generally limited to determining the maximum safe amount of covered pollutants in the air. As to each hazardous pollutant, by contrast, the Agency must promulgate emissions standards for both new and existing major sources. § 7412(d)(1). Those standards must require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions  that the EPA Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable  through application of measures, processes, methods, systems or techniques of emission reduction. § 7412(d)(2). In other words, EPA must directly require all covered sources to reduce their emissions to a certain level. And it chooses that level by determining the maximum degree of reduction it considers achievable in practice by using the best existing technologies and methods. § 7412(d)(3).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,65,"Thus, in the parlance of environmental law, Section 112 directs the Agency to impose technology-based standards for hazardous emissions, Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540  U.S. 461, 485, n. 12, 124 S.Ct. 983, 157 L.Ed.2d 967 (2004) (emphasis added). This sort of `technology-based' approach focuses upon the control technologies that are available to industrial entities and requires the agency to  ensure that regulated firms adopt the appropriate cleanup technology. T. McGarity, Media-Quality, Technology, and Cost-Benefit Balancing Strategies for Health and Environmental Regulation, 46 Law & Contemp. Prob. 159, 160 (Summer 1983) (McGarity). (Such technologies are not limited to literal technology, such as scrubbers, changes in the design and operation of the facility, or in the way that employees perform their tasks, are also available options. Id., at 163, n. 18.)",Roberts,0,
2021-045,66,"The third air pollution control scheme is the New Source Performance Standards program of Section 111. § 7411. That section directs EPA to list categories of stationary sources that it determines cause, or contribute significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. § 7411(b)(1)(A). Under Section 111(b), the Agency must then promulgate for each category Federal standards of performance for new sources, § 7411(b)(1)(B). A standard of performance is one that",Roberts,0,
2021-045,67,reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the EPA Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated. § 7411(a)(1).,Roberts,0,
2021-045,68,"Thus, the statute directs EPA to (1) determine, taking into account various factors, the best system of emission reduction which  has been adequately demonstrated, (2) ascertain the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of that system, and (3) impose an emissions limit on new stationary sources that reflects that amount. Ibid., see also 80 Fed. Reg. 64538 (2015). Generally speaking, a source may achieve that emissions cap any way it chooses, the key is that its pollution be no more than the amount achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction adequately demonstrated, or the BSER. § 7411(a)(1), see § 7411(b)(5). EPA undertakes this analysis on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis, establishing different standards of performance with respect to different pollutants emitted from the same source category. See, e.g., 73 Fed. Reg. 35838 (2008), 42 Fed. Reg. 22510 (1977).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,69,"Although the thrust of Section 111 focuses on emissions limits for new and modified sources—as its title indicates —the statute also authorizes regulation of certain pollutants from existing sources. Under Section 111(d), once EPA has set new source standards addressing emissions of a particular pollutant under section 111(b), 80 Fed. Reg. 64711, it must then address emissions of that same pollutant by existing sources—but only if they are not already regulated under the NAAQS or HAP programs. § 7411(d)(1). Existing power plants, for example, emit many pollutants covered by a NAAQS or HAP standard. Section 111(d) thus operates as a gap-filler, empowering EPA to regulate harmful emissions not already controlled under the Agency's other authorities. American Lung Assn. v. EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 932 (CADC 2021).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,70,"Although the States set the actual rules governing existing power plants, EPA itself still retains the primary regulatory role in Section 111(d). The Agency, not the States, decides the amount of pollution  reduction that must ultimately be achieved. It does so by again determining, as when setting the new source rules, the best system of emission reduction  that has been adequately demonstrated for existing covered facilities. 40 CFR § 60.22(b)(5) (2021), see also 80 Fed. Reg. 64664, and n. 1. The States then submit plans containing the emissions restrictions that they intend to adopt and enforce in order not to exceed the permissible level of pollution established by EPA. See §§ 60.23, 60.24, 42 U. S. C. § 7411(d)(1).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,71,"Reflecting the ancillary nature of Section 111(d), EPA has used it only a handful of times since the enactment of the statute in 1970. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64703, and n. 275 (past regulations pertained to four pollutants from five source categories). For instance, the Agency has established emissions limits on acid mist from sulfuric acid production, 41 Fed. Reg. 48706 (1976) (identifying fiber mist eliminator technology as BSER), sulfide gases released by kraft pulp mills, 44 Fed. Reg. 29829 (1979) (determining BSER to be a combination of scrubbers, incineration, filtration systems, and temperature control), and emissions of various harmful gases from municipal landfills, 61 Fed. Reg. 9907 (1996) (setting BSER as use of a flare to combust the gases). It was thus only a slight overstatement for one of the architects of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to refer to Section 111(d) as an obscure, never-used section of the law. Hearings on S. 300 et al. before the Subcommittee on Environmental Protection of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1987) (remarks of Sen. Durenberger).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,73,"Things changed in October 2015, when EPA promulgated two rules addressing carbon dioxide pollution from power plants—one for new plants under Section 111(b), the other for existing plants under Section 111(d). Both were premised on the Agency's earlier finding that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare by causing climate change. 80 Fed. Reg. 64530. Carbon dioxide is not subject to a NAAQS and has not been listed as a toxic pollutant.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,74,"The first rule announced by EPA established federal carbon emissions limits for new power plants of two varieties: fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units (mostly coal fired) and natural-gas-fired stationary combustion turbines. Id., at 64512. Following the statutory process set out above, the Agency determined the BSER for the two categories of sources. For steam generating units, for instance, EPA determined that the BSER was a combination of high-efficiency production processes and carbon capture technology. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64512. EPA then set the emissions limit based on the amount of carbon dioxide that a plant would emit with these technologies in place. Id., at 64513.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,75,"The second rule was triggered by the first: Because EPA was now regulating carbon dioxide from new coal and gas plants, Section 111(d) required EPA to also address carbon emissions from existing coal and gas plants. See § 7411(d)(1). It did so through what it called the Clean Power Plan rule.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,76,"In that rule, EPA established final emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to regulate existing power plants within their borders. Id., at 64662. To arrive at the guideline limits, EPA did the same thing it does when imposing federal regulations on new sources: It identified the BSER.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,77,"The BSER that the Agency selected for existing coal-fired power plants, however,  was quite different from the BSER it had chosen for new sources. The BSER for existing plants included three types of measures, which the Agency called building blocks. Id., at 64667. The first building block was heat rate improvements at coal-fired plants—essentially practices such plants could undertake to burn coal more efficiently. Id., at 64727. But such improvements, EPA stated, would lead to only small emission reductions, because coal-fired power plants were already operating near optimum efficiency. Ibid. On the Agency's view, much larger emission reductions were needed from coal-fired plants to address climate change. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,78,"So the Agency included two additional building blocks in its BSER, both of which involve what it called generation shifting from higher-emitting to lower-emitting producers of electricity. Id., at 64728. Building block two was a shift in electricity production from existing coal-fired power plants to natural-gas-fired plants. Ibid. Because natural gas plants produce typically less than half as much carbon dioxide per unit of electricity created as coal-fired plants, the Agency explained, this generation shift would reduce CO2 emissions. Ibid. Building block three worked the same way, except that the shift was from both coal- and gas-fired plants to new low- or zero-carbon generating capacity, mainly wind and solar. Id., at 64729, 64748. Most of the CO2 controls in the rule came from the application of building blocks two and three. Id., at 64728.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,79,"The Agency identified three ways in which a regulated plant operator could implement a shift in generation to cleaner sources. Id., at 64731. First, an operator could simply reduce the regulated plant's own production of electricity. Second, it could build a new natural gas plant, wind farm, or solar installation, or invest in someone else's existing facility and then increase generation there. Ibid. Finally, operators could purchase emission allowances or credits as part of a cap-and-trade regime. Id., at 64731-64732. Under such a scheme, sources that achieve a reduction in their emissions can sell a credit representing the value of that reduction to others, who are able to count it toward their own applicable emissions caps.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,80,"EPA explained that taking any of these steps would implement a sector-wide shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas and renewables. Id., at 64731. Given the integrated nature of the power grid, adding electricity to the grid from one generator will result in the instantaneous reduction in generation from other generators, and reductions in generation from one generator lead to the instantaneous increase in generation by others. Id., at 64769. So coal plants, whether by reducing their own production, subsidizing an increase in production by cleaner sources, or both, would cause a shift toward wind, solar, and natural gas.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,81,"Having decided that the best system of emission reduction  adequately demonstrated was one that would reduce carbon pollution mostly by moving production to cleaner sources, EPA then set about determining the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of that system. 42 U. S. C. § 7411(a)(1). The Agency recognized that—given the nature of generation shifting—it could choose from a wide range of potential stringencies for the BSER. 80 Fed. Reg. 64730. Put differently, in translating the BSER into an operational emissions limit, EPA could choose whether to require anything from a little generation shifting to a great deal. The Agency settled on what it regarded as a reasonable amount of shift, which it based on modeling of how much more electricity both natural gas and renewable sources could supply without  causing undue cost increases or reducing the overall power supply. Id., at 64797-64811. Based on these changes, EPA projected that by 2030, it would be feasible to have coal provide 27% of national electricity generation, down from 38% in 2014. Id., at 64665, 64694, see Dept. of Energy, U. S. Energy Information Admin., Monthly Energy Review (May 2015), Electricity Net Generation: Electric Power Sector, p. 106 (Table 7.2b).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,82,"From these significant projected reductions in generation, EPA developed a series of complex equations to determine the emission performance rates that States would be required to implement. 80 Fed. Reg. 64815. The calculations resulted in numerical emissions ceilings so strict that no existing coal plant would have been able to achieve them without engaging in one of the three means of shifting generation described above. Indeed, the emissions limit the Clean Power Plan established for existing power plants was actually stricter than the cap imposed by the simultaneously published standards for new plants. Compare id., at 64742, with id., at 64513.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,83,"The point, after all, was to compel the transfer of power generating capacity from existing sources to wind and solar. The White House stated that the Clean Power Plan would drive an  aggressive transformation in the domestic energy industry. White House Fact Sheet, App. in American Lung Assn. v. EPA, No. 19-1140 etc. (CADC), p. 2076. EPA's own modeling concluded that the rule would entail billions of dollars in compliance costs (to be paid in the form of higher energy prices), require the retirement of dozens of coal-fired plants, and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs across various sectors. EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Clean Power Plan Final Rule 3-22, 3-30, 3-33, 6-24, 6-25 (2015). The Energy Information Administration reached similar conclusions, projecting that the rule would cause retail electricity prices to remain persistently 10% higher in many States, and would reduce GDP by at least a trillion 2009 dollars by 2040. Dept. of Energy, Analysis of the Impacts of the Clean Power Plan 21, 63-64 (May 2015).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,85,"These projections were never tested, because the Clean Power Plan never went into effect. The same day that EPA promulgated the rule, dozens of parties (including 27 States) petitioned for review in the D. C. Circuit. After that court declined to enter a stay of the rule, the challengers sought the same relief from this Court. We granted a stay, preventing the rule from taking effect. West Virginia v. EPA, 577 U.S. 1126, 136 S.Ct. 1000, 194 L.Ed.2d 17 (2016). The Court of Appeals later heard argument on the merits en banc. But before it could issue a decision, there was a change in Presidential administrations. The new administration requested that the litigation be held in abeyance so that EPA could reconsider the Clean Power Plan. The D. C. Circuit obliged, and later dismissed the petitions for review as moot.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,86,"EPA eventually repealed the rule in 2019, concluding that the Clean Power Plan had been in excess of its statutory authority under Section 111(d). 84 Fed. Reg. 32523 (2019). Specifically, the Agency concluded that generation shifting should not have been considered as part of the BSER. The Agency interpreted Section 111 as limiting the BSER to those systems that can be put into operation at a building, structure, facility, or installation, such as add-on controls and inherently lower-emitting processes/practices/designs. Id., at 32524. It then explained that the Clean Power Plan, rather than setting the standard based on the application of equipment and practices at the level of an  individual facility, had instead based it on a shift in the energy generation mix at the grid level, id., at 32523—not the sort of measure that has a potential for application to an individual source. Id., at 32524.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,87,"The Agency determined that the interpretative question raised by the Clean Power Plan—i.e., whether a `system of emission reduction' can consist of generation-shifting measures—fell under the major question doctrine. Id., at 32529. Under that doctrine, EPA explained, courts expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance. Ibid. (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427, 189 L.Ed.2d 372 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Agency concluded that the Clean Power Plan was such a decision, for a number of reasons. Its generation-shifting scheme was projected to have billions of dollars of impact. 84 Fed. Reg. 32529. No section 111 rule of the scores issued had ever been based on generation shifting. Ibid. And that novel reading of the statute would empower EPA to order the wholesale restructuring of any industrial sector based only on its discretionary assessment of such factors as `cost' and `feasibility.' Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,88,"EPA argued that under the major questions doctrine, a clear statement was necessary to conclude that Congress intended to delegate authority of this breadth to regulate a fundamental sector of the economy. Ibid. It found none. Indeed, it concluded, given the text and structure of the statute, Congress has directly spoken to this precise question and precluded the use of measures such as generation shifting. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,89,"In the same rulemaking, the Agency replaced the Clean Power Plan by promulgating a different Section 111(d) regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. Id., at 32532. Based on its view of what measures may permissibly make up the BSER, EPA determined that the best system would be akin to building block one of the Clean Power Plan: a combination of equipment upgrades and operating practices that would improve facilities' heat rates. Id., at 32522, 32537. The ACE Rule determined that the application of its BSER measures would result in only small reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Id., at 32561.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,91,"A number of States and private parties immediately filed petitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging EPA's repeal of the Clean Power Plan and its enactment of the replacement ACE Rule. Other States and private entities—including petitioners here West Virginia, North Dakota, Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC, and The North American Coal Corporation (NACC)—intervened to defend both actions.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,92,"The Court of Appeals consolidated all 12 petitions for review into one case. It then held that EPA's repeal of the Clean Power Plan rested critically on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act—namely, that generation shifting cannot be a system of emission reduction under Section 111. 985 F.3d at 995. To the contrary, the court concluded, the statute could reasonably be read to encompass generation shifting. As part of that analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that the major questions doctrine did not apply, and thus rejected the need for a clear statement of congressional intent to delegate such power to EPA. Id., at 959-968. Having found that EPA misunderstood the scope of its authority under the Clean Air Act, the Court vacated the Agency's repeal of the Clean Power Plan and remanded to the  Agency for further consideration. Id., at 995. It also vacated and remanded the replacement rule, the ACE Rule, for the same reason. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,93,"The court's decision, handed down on January 19, 2021, was quickly followed by another change in Presidential administrations. One month later, EPA moved the Court of Appeals to partially stay the issuance of its mandate as it pertained to the Clean Power Plan.

EPA, No. 19-1140 etc. (CADC), p. 4. EPA believed that such a result would not make sense while it was in the process of considering whether to promulgate a new Section 111(d) rule. Ibid.

2021-045,94,"Westmoreland, NACC, and the States defending the repeal of the Clean Power Plan all filed petitions for certiorari. We granted the petitions and consolidated the cases. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 420, 211 L.Ed.2d 243 (2021).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,96,We first consider the Government's contention that no petitioner has Article III standing to seek our review.,Roberts,0,
2021-045,97,"Although most disputes over standing concern whether a plaintiff has satisfied the requirement when filing suit, Article III demands that an actual controversy persist throughout all stages of litigation. Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 705, 133 S.Ct. 2652, 186 L.Ed.2d 768 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirement of standing must be met by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 64, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997). In considering a litigant's standing to appeal, the question is whether it has experienced an injury fairly traceable to the judgment below. Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2356, 2362, 204 L.Ed.2d 742 (2019) (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted). If so, and a favorable ruling from the appellate court would redress that injury, then the appellant has a cognizable Article III stake. Ibid.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,98,"Here, it is apparent that at least one group of petitioners—the state petitioners —are injured by the Court of Appeals' judgment. That judgment vacated the ACE rule and its embedded repeal of the Clean Power Plan, 985 F.3d at 995 (emphasis added), and accordingly purports to bring the Clean Power Plan back into legal effect. Thus, to the extent the Clean Power Plan harms the States, the D. C. Circuit's judgment inflicts the same injury. And there can be little question that the rule does injure the States, since they are the object of its requirement that they more stringently regulate power plant emissions within their borders. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-562, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).",Roberts,0,

First, after the decision, EPA informed the Court of Appeals that it does not intend to enforce the Clean Power Plan because it has decided to promulgate a new Section 111(d) rule. Second, on EPA's request, the lower court stayed the part of its judgment that vacated the repeal, pending that new  rulemaking. These circumstances, says the Government, have mooted the prior dispute as to the CPP Repeal Rule's legality. Id., at 17 (emphasis added).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,100,"That Freudian slip, however, reveals the basic flaw in the Government's argument: It is the doctrine of mootness, not standing, that addresses whether an intervening circumstance has deprived the plaintiff of a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.

Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189, 120 S.Ct. 693. Although the Government briefly argues that the lower court's stay of its mandate extinguished the controversy, it cites no authority for that proposition, and it does not make sense: Lower courts frequently stay their mandates when notified that the losing party intends to seek our certiorari review. So the Government's mootness argument boils down to its representation that EPA has no intention of enforcing the Clean Power Plan prior to promulgating a new Section 111(d) rule.",Roberts,0,

The issue here is whether restructuring the Nation's overall mix of electricity generation, to transition from 38% coal to 27% coal by 2030, can be the best system of emission reduction within the meaning of Section 111.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,106,"It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme. Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989). Where the statute at issue is one that confers  authority upon an administrative agency, that inquiry must be shaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the question presented—whether Congress in fact meant to confer the power the agency has asserted. FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 159, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). In the ordinary case, that context has no great effect on the appropriate analysis. Nonetheless, our precedent teaches that there are extraordinary cases that call for a different approach—cases in which the history and the breadth of the authority that the agency has asserted, and the economic and political significance of that assertion, provide a reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer such authority.

Id., at 126-127, 120 S.Ct. 1291. We rejected that expansive construction of the statute, concluding that Congress could not have intended to delegate such a sweeping and consequential authority in so cryptic a fashion.

We found the statute's language a wafer-thin reed on which to rest such a measure, given the sheer scope of the CDC's claimed authority, its unprecedented nature, and the fact that Congress had failed to extend the moratorium after previously having done so.

Despite its textual plausibility, we noted that the Agency's interpretation would have given it permitting authority over millions of small sources, such as hotels and office buildings, that had never before been subject to such requirements. Id., at 310, 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. We declined to uphold EPA's claim of unheralded regulatory power over a significant portion of the American economy. Id., at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. In Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006), we confronted the Attorney General's assertion that he could rescind the license of any physician who prescribed a controlled substance for assisted suicide, even in a State where such action was legal. The Attorney General argued that this came within his statutory power to revoke licenses where he found them inconsistent with the public interest, 21 U. S. C. § 823(f). We considered the idea that Congress gave him such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation not sustainable. 546 U.S. at 267, 126 S.Ct. 904. Similar considerations informed our recent decision invalidating the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's mandate that 84 million Americans  either obtain a COVID-19 vaccine or undergo weekly medical testing at their own expense.

Extraordinary grants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished through modest words, vague terms, or subtle devices. Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468, 121 S.Ct. 903. Nor does Congress typically use oblique or elliptical language to empower an agency to make a radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 229, 114 S.Ct. 2223, 129 L.Ed.2d 182 (1994).

Verkuil, Controlling ChevronBased Delegations, 20 Cardozo L. Rev. 989, 1011 (1999). We presume that Congress intends to make major policy decisions itself, not leave those decisions to agencies.

2021-045,112,"As for the major questions doctrine label, post, at 2633, it took hold because it refers to an identifiable body of law that has developed over a series of significant cases all addressing a particular and recurring problem: agencies asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted. Scholars and jurists have recognized the common threads between those decisions. So have we. See Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427 (citing Brown & Williamson and MCI), King v.

2021-045,114,"Under our precedents, this is a major questions case. In arguing that Section 111(d) empowers it to substantially restructure the American energy market, EPA claimed to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power representing a transformative expansion in its regulatory authority. Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. It located that newfound power in the vague language of an ancillary provision of the Act, Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, one that was designed to function as a gap filler and had rarely been used in the preceding decades. And the Agency's discovery allowed it to adopt a regulatory program that Congress had conspicuously and repeatedly declined to enact itself.

2021-045,115,"Prior to 2015, EPA had always set emissions limits under Section 111 based on the application of measures that would reduce pollution by causing the regulated source to operate more cleanly. See, e.g., 41 Fed. Reg. 48706 (requiring degree of control achievable through the application of fiber mist eliminators), see also supra, at 2601-2602. It had never devised a cap by looking to a system that would reduce pollution simply by shifting polluting activity from dirtier to cleaner sources. 80 Fed. Reg. 64726, see id., at 64738 (Our traditional interpretation  has allowed regulated entities to produce as much of a particular good as they desire provided that they do so through an appropriately clean (or low-emitting) process.). And as Justice Frankfurter has noted, just as established practice may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is equally significant in determining whether such power was actually conferred. FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U.S. 349, 352, 61 S.Ct. 580, 85 L.Ed. 881 (1941).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,116,"The Government quibbles with this description of the history of Section 111(d), pointing to one rule that it says relied upon a cap-and-trade mechanism to reduce emissions. See 70 Fed. Reg. 28616 (2005) (Mercury Rule). The legality of that choice was controversial at the time and was never addressed by a court. See New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (CADC 2008) (vacating on other grounds). Even assuming the Rule was valid, though, it still does not help the Government. In that regulation, EPA set the actual emission cap—i.e., the limit on emissions that sources would be required to meet—based on the level of mercury emissions reductions that would be achievable by the use of technologies that could be installed and operational on a nationwide basis in the relevant timeframe—namely, wet scrubbers. 70 Fed. Reg. 28620-28621. In other words, EPA set the cap based on the application of particular controls, and regulated sources could have complied by installing them. By contrast, and by design, there is no control a coal plant operator can deploy to attain the emissions limits established by the Clean Power Plan. See supra, at 2604. The Mercury Rule, therefore, is no precedent for the Clean Power Plan. To the contrary, it was one more entry in an unbroken list of prior Section 111 rules that devised the enforceable emissions limit by determining the best control mechanisms  available for the source.1",Roberts,0,
2021-045,117,"This consistent understanding of systems of emission reduction tracked the seemingly universal view, as stated by EPA in its inaugural Section 111(d) rulemaking, that Congress intended a technology-based approach to regulation in that Section. 40 Fed. Reg. 53343 (1975), see id., at 53341 (degree of control to be reflected in EPA's emission guidelines will be based on application of best adequately demonstrated control technology).2 A technology-based standard, recall, is one that focuses on improving the emissions performance of individual sources. EPA commonly referred to the level of control required as a best demonstrated technology (BDT) standard, 73 Fed. Reg. 34073, and consistently applied it as such. E.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 9907 (declaring BDT to be a well-designed and well-operated gas collection system and  a control device capable of reducing harmful gases in the collected gas by 98 weight-percent.).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,118,"Indeed, EPA nodded to this history in the Clean Power Plan itself, describing the sort of systems of emission reduction it had always before selected—efficiency improvements, fuel-switching, and add-on controls—as more traditional air pollution control measures. 80 Fed. Reg. 64784. The Agency noted that it had considered such measures as potential systems of emission reduction for carbon dioxide, ibid., including a measure it ultimately adopted as a component of the BSER, namely, heat rate improvements. Id., at 64727.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,119,"But, the Agency explained, in order to control CO2 from affected plants at levels  necessary to mitigate the dangers presented by climate change, it could not base the emissions limit on measures that improve efficiency at the power plants. Id., at 64728. The quantity of emissions reductions resulting from the application of these measures would have been too small. Id., at 64727. Instead, to attain the necessary critical CO2 reductions, EPA adopted what it called a broader, forward-thinking approach to the design of Section 111 regulations. Id., at 64703. Rather than focus on improving the performance of individual sources, it would improve the overall power system by lowering the carbon intensity of power generation. Ibid. (emphasis added). And it would do that by forcing a shift throughout the power grid from one type of energy  source to another. In the words of the then-EPA Administrator, the rule was not about pollution control so much as it was an investment opportunity for States, especially investments in renewables and clean energy. Oversight Hearing on EPA's Proposed Carbon Pollution Standards for Existing Power Plants before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 113th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 33 (2014).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,120,"This view of EPA's authority was not only unprecedented, it also effected a fundamental revision of the statute, changing it from one sort of scheme of  regulation into an entirely different kind. MCI, 512 U.S. at 231, 114 S.Ct. 2223. Under the Agency's prior view of Section 111, its role was limited to ensuring the efficient pollution performance of each individual regulated source. Under that paradigm, if a source was already operating at that level, there was nothing more for EPA to do. Under its newly discovered authority, Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427, however, EPA can demand much greater reductions in emissions based on a very different kind of policy judgment: that it would be best if coal made up a much smaller share of national electricity generation. And on this view of EPA's authority, it could go further, perhaps forcing coal plants to shift away virtually all of their generation—i.e., to cease making power altogether.3",Roberts,0,
2021-045,121,"The Government attempts to downplay the magnitude of this unprecedented power over American industry. Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 645, 100 S.Ct. 2844, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980) (plurality opinion). The amount of generation shifting ordered, it argues, must be adequately demonstrated and best in light of the statutory factors of cost, nonair quality health and environmental impact, and energy requirements. 42 U. S. C. § 7411(a)(1). EPA therefore must limit the magnitude of generation shift it demands to a level that will not be exorbitantly costly or threaten the reliability of the grid. Brief for Federal Respondents 42.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,122,"But this argument does not so much limit the breadth of the Government's claimed authority as reveal it. On EPA's view of Section 111(d), Congress implicitly tasked it, and it alone, with balancing the many vital considerations of national policy implicated in deciding how Americans will get their energy. EPA decides, for instance, how much of a switch from coal to natural gas is practically feasible by 2020, 2025, and 2030 before the grid collapses, and how high energy prices can go as a result before they become unreasonably exorbitant.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,123,"There is little reason to think Congress assigned such decisions to the Agency. For one thing, as EPA itself admitted when requesting special funding, Understanding and projecting system-wide trends in areas such as electricity transmission, distribution, and storage requires technical and policy expertise not traditionally needed in EPA regulatory development. EPA, Fiscal Year 2016: Justification of Appropriation Estimates for the Committee on Appropriations 213 (2015) (emphasis added). When an agency has  no comparative expertise in making certain policy judgments, we have said, Congress presumably would not task it with doing so. Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.

2021-045,124,"We also find it highly unlikely that Congress would leave to agency discretion the decision of how much coal- based generation there should be over the coming decades.

The basic and consequential tradeoffs involved in such a choice are ones that Congress would likely have intended for itself. See W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How To Read Statutes and the Constitution 288 (2016) (Even if Congress has delegated an agency general rulemaking or adjudicatory power, judges presume that Congress does not delegate its authority to settle or amend major social and economic policy decisions.). Congress certainly has not conferred a like authority upon EPA anywhere else in the Clean Air Act.

2021-045,125,"The dissent contends that there is nothing surprising about EPA dictating the optimal mix of energy sources nationwide, since that sort of mandate will reduce air pollution from power plants, which is EPA's bread and butter. Post, at 2636-2638. But that does not follow. Forbidding evictions may slow the spread of disease, but the CDC's ordering such a measure certainly raises an eyebrow. Post, at 2636. We would not expect the Department of Homeland Security to make trade or foreign policy even though doing so could decrease illegal immigration. And no one would consider generation shifting a tool in OSHA's toolbox, post, at 2637, even though reducing generation at coal plants would reduce workplace illness and injury from coal dust.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,126,"The dissent also cites our decision in American Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 131 S.Ct. 2527, 180 L.Ed.2d 435 (2011). Post, at 2636-2637. The question there, however, was whether Congress wanted district court judges to decide, under unwritten federal nuisance law, whether and how to regulate carbondioxide emissions from powerplants. 564 U.S. at 426, 131 S.Ct. 2527. We answered no, given the existence of Section 111(d). But we said nothing about the ways in which Congress intended EPA to exercise its power under that provision. And it is doubtful we had in mind that it would claim the authority to require a large shift from coal to natural gas, wind, and solar. After all, EPA had never regulated in that manner, despite having issued many prior rules governing power plants under Section 111. See, e.g., 71 Fed. Reg. 9866 (2006), 70 Fed. Reg. 28616, 44 Fed. Reg. 33580, 36 Fed. Reg. 24875 (1973).4  Finally, we cannot ignore that the regulatory writ EPA newly uncovered conveniently enabled it to enact a program that, long after the dangers posed by greenhouse gas emissions had become well known, Congress considered and rejected multiple times.

S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2486-2487, Bunte Brothers, 312 U.S. at 352, 61 S.Ct. 580 (lack of authority not previously exercised reinforced by agency's unsuccessful attempt  to secure from Congress an express grant of the challenged authority). At bottom, the Clean Power Plan essentially adopted a cap-and-trade scheme, or set of state cap-and-trade schemes, for carbon. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64734 (Emissions trading is  an integral part of our BSER analysis.). Congress, however, has consistently rejected proposals to amend the Clean Air Act to create such a program. See, e.g., American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, H. R. 2454, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, S. 1733, 111th Cong., 1st Sess. (2009). It has also declined to enact similar measures, such as a carbon tax. See, e.g., Climate Protection Act of 2013, S. 332, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., Save our Climate Act of 2011, H. R. 3242, 112th Cong., 1st Sess. The importance of the issue, along with the fact that the same basic scheme EPA adopted has been the subject of an earnest and profound debate across the country, makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect. Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 267-268, 126 S.Ct. 904 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2021-045,128,"Given these circumstances, our precedent counsels skepticism toward EPA's claim that Section 111 empowers it to devise carbon emissions caps based on a generation shifting approach. To overcome that skepticism, the Government must— under the major questions doctrine—point to clear congressional authorization to regulate in that manner. Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,129,"All the Government can offer, however, is the Agency's authority to establish emissions caps at a level reflecting the application of the best system of emission reduction adequately demonstrated. 42 U.

AT&T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 407, 131 S.Ct. 1177, 179 L.Ed.2d 132 (2011), generation shifting can be described as a system—an aggregation or assemblage of objects united by some form of regular interaction, Brief for Federal Respondents 31—capable of reducing emissions. But of course almost anything could constitute such a system, shorn of all context, the word is an empty vessel. Such a vague statutory grant is not close to the sort of clear authorization required by our precedents.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,130,"The Government, echoed by the other respondents, looks to other provisions of the Clean Air Act for support. It points out that the Act elsewhere uses the word system or similar words to describe cap-and-trade schemes or other sector-wide mechanisms for reducing pollution. Ibid. The Acid Rain program set out in Title IV of the Act establishes a cap-and-trade scheme for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, which the statute refers to as an emission allocation and transfer system. § 7651(b) (emphasis added). And Section 110 of the NAAQS program specifies that marketable permits and auctions of emissions rights qualify as control measures, means, or techniques that States  may adopt in their state implementation plans in order to meet the applicable requirements of a NAAQS. § 7410(a)(2)(A). If the word system or similar words like technique or means can encompass cap-and-trade, the Government maintains, why not in Section 111?",Roberts,0,
2021-045,131,"But just because a cap-and-trade system can be used to reduce emissions does not mean that it is the kind of system of emission reduction referred to in Section 111. Indeed, the Government's examples demonstrate why it is not.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,132,"First, unlike Section 111, the Acid Rain and NAAQS programs contemplate trading systems as a means of complying with an already established emissions limit, set either directly by Congress (as with Acid Rain, see 42 U. S. C. § 7651c) or by reference to the safe concentration of the pollutant in the ambient air (as with the NAAQS). In Section 111, by contrast, it is EPA's job to come up with the cap itself: the numerical limit on emissions that States must apply to each source. 80 Fed. Reg. 64768. We doubt that Congress directed the Agency to set an emissions cap at the level which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of a cap-and-trade system, § 7411(a)(1), for that degree is indeterminate. It is one thing for Congress to authorize regulated sources to use trading to comply with a preset cap, or a cap that must be based on some scientific, objective criterion, such as the NAAQS. It is quite another to simply authorize EPA to set the cap itself wherever the Agency sees fit.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,133,"Second, Congress added the above authorizations for the use of emissions trading programs in 1990, simultaneous with amending Section 111 to its present form. At the time, cap-and-trade was a novel and highly touted concept. The Acid Rain program was the nation's first-ever emissions trading program. L. Heinzerling & R. Steinzor, A Perfect Storm: Mercury and the Bush Administration, 34 Env. L. Rep. 10297, 10309 (2004). And Congress went out of its way to amend the NAAQS statute to make absolutely clear that the measures, means, and techniques States could use to meet the NAAQS included cap-and-trade. § 7410(a)(2)(A). Yet not a peep was heard from Congress about the possibility that a trading regime could be installed under § 111. Id., at 10309.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,134,"Finally, the Government notes that other parts of the Clean Air Act, past and present, have explicitly limited the permissible components of a particular `system' of emission reduction in some regard. Brief for Federal Respondents 32. For instance, a separate section of the statute empowers EPA to require the degree of reduction achievable through the retrofit application of the best system of continuous emission reduction. § 7651f(b)(2) (emphasis added). The comparatively unadorned use of the phrase best system of emission reduction in Section 111, the Government urges, suggests a conscious congressional choice not to limit the measures that may constitute the BSER to those applicable at or to an individual source. Id., at 32.",Roberts,0,
2021-045,135,"These arguments, however, concern an interpretive question that is not at issue. We have no occasion to decide whether the statutory phrase system of emission reduction refers exclusively to measures that improve the pollution performance of individual sources, such that all other actions are ineligible to qualify as the BSER. To be sure, it is pertinent to our analysis that EPA has acted consistent with such a limitation for the first four decades of the statute's existence. But the only interpretive question before us, and the only one we answer, is more narrow: whether the best system of emission reduction identified  by EPA in the Clean Power Plan was within the authority granted to the Agency in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. For the reasons given, the answer is no.5* * *",Roberts,0,
2021-045,136,"Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible solution to the crisis of the day.

2021-045,139,"To resolve today's case the Court invokes the major questions doctrine. Under that doctrine's terms, administrative agencies must be able to point to `clear congressional authorization' when they claim the power to make decisions of vast `economic and political significance.' Ante, at 2608, 2609. Like many parallel clear-statement rules in our law, this one operates to protect foundational constitutional guarantees. I join the Court's opinion and write to offer some additional observations about the doctrine on which it rests.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,142,"One of the Judiciary's most solemn duties is to ensure that acts of Congress are applied in accordance with the Constitution in the cases that come before us. To help fulfill that duty, courts have developed certain clear-statement rules. These rules assume that, absent a clear statement otherwise, Congress means for its laws to operate in congruence with the Constitution rather than test its bounds. In this way, these clear-statement rules help courts act as faithful agents of the Constitution. A. Barrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B. U. L. Rev. 109, 169 (2010) (Barrett).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,143,"Consider some examples. The Constitution prohibits Congress from passing laws imposing various types of retroactive liability. See Art. I, § 9, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265-266, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). Consistent with this rule, Chief Justice Marshall long ago advised that a court  ought to struggle hard against a statutory construction which will, by a retrospective operation, affect the rights of parties. United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 110, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801). Justice Paterson likewise insisted that courts must interpret statutes to apply only prospectively unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative, that no other meaning can be annexed to them. United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399, 413, 2 L.Ed. 479 (1806).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,144,"The Constitution also incorporates the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See, e.g., Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 12-17, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890). To enforce that doctrine, courts have consistently held  that nothing but express words, or an insurmountable implication would justify the conclusion that lawmakers intended to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 450, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting), see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). In a similar vein, Justice Story observed that it is a general rule in the interpretation of legislative acts not to construe them to embrace the sovereign power or government, unless expressly named or included by necessary implication. United States v. Greene, 26 F.Cas. 33, 34 (No. 15, 258) (CC D.Me. 1827).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,145,"The major questions doctrine works in much the same way to protect the Constitution's separation of powers. Ante, at 2609. In Article I, the People vested all federal legislative powers  in Congress. Preamble, Art. I, § 1. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that important subjects  must be entirely regulated by the legislature itself, even if Congress may leave the Executive to act under such general provisions to fill up the details. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42-43, 6 L.Ed. 253 (1825). Doubtless, what qualifies as an important subject and what constitutes a detail may be debated. See, e.g., Gundy v. United States, 588 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. 2116, 2122-2124, 204 L.Ed.2d 522 (2019) (plurality opinion), id., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2135-2137 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). But no less than its rules against retroactive legislation or protecting sovereign immunity, the Constitution's rule vesting federal legislative power in Congress is vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the Constitution. Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692, 12 S.Ct. 495, 36 L.Ed. 294 (1892).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,146,"It is vital because the framers believed that a republic—a thing of the people— would be more likely to enact just laws than a regime administered by a ruling class of largely unaccountable ministers. The Federalist No. 11, p. 85 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). From time to time, some have questioned that assessment.1 But by vesting the lawmaking power in the people's elected representatives, the Constitution sought to ensure not only that all power would be derived from the people, but also that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people. Id., No. 37, at 227 (J. Madison). The Constitution, too, placed its trust not in the hands of a few, but in a number of hands, ibid., so that those who make our laws would better reflect the diversity of the people they represent and have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people. Id., No. 52, at 327 (J. Madison). Today, some might describe the Constitution as having designed the federal lawmaking process to capture the wisdom of the masses. See P. Hamburger, Is Administrative Law Unlawful? 502-503 (2014).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,147,"Admittedly, lawmaking under our Constitution can be difficult. But that is nothing particular to our time nor any accident. The framers believed that the power to make new laws regulating private conduct was a grave one that could, if not properly checked, pose a serious threat to individual liberty. See The Federalist No. 48, at 309-312 (J. Madison), see also id., No. 73, at 441-442 (A. Hamilton). As a result, the framers deliberately sought to make lawmaking difficult by insisting that two houses of Congress must agree to any new law and the President must concur or a legislative supermajority must override his veto.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,148,"The difficulty of the design sought to serve other ends too. By effectively requiring a broad consensus to pass legislation, the Constitution sought to ensure that any new laws would enjoy wide social acceptance, profit from input by an array of different perspectives during their consideration, and thanks to all this prove stable over time. See id., No. 10, at 82-84 (J. Madison). The need for compromise inherent in this design also sought to protect minorities by ensuring that their votes would often decide the fate of proposed legislation—allowing them to wield real power alongside the majority. See id., No. 51, at 322-324 (J. Madison). The difficulty of legislating at the federal level aimed as well to preserve room for lawmaking by governments more local and more accountable than a distant federal authority, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 536, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) (plurality opinion), and in this way allow States to serve as laboratories for novel social and economic experiments, New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311, 52 S.Ct. 371, 76 L.Ed. 747 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), see J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions: States and the Making of American Constitutional Law 11 (2018).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,149,"Permitting Congress to divest its legislative power to the Executive Branch would dash this whole scheme. Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, 575 U.S. 43, 61, 135 S.Ct. 1225, 191 L.Ed.2d 153 (2015) (ALITO, J., concurring). Legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the current President, or, worse yet, the will of unelected officials barely responsive to him. See S. Breyer, Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View 110 (2010) (The president may not have the time or willingness to review agency decisions). In a world like that, agencies could churn out new laws more or less at whim. Intrusions on liberty would not be difficult and rare, but easy and profuse. See The Federalist No. 47, at 303 (J. Madison), id., No. 62, at 378 (J. Madison). Stability would be lost, with vast numbers of laws changing with every new presidential administration. Rather than embody a wide social consensus and input from minority voices, laws would more often bear the support only of the party currently in power. Powerful special interests, which are sometimes uniquely able to influence the agendas of administrative agencies, would flourish while others would be left to ever-shifting winds. T. Merrill, Capture Theory and the Courts: 1967-1983, 72 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 1039, 1043 (1997). Finally, little would remain to stop agencies from moving into areas where state authority has traditionally predominated. See, e.g., Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 173-174, 121 S.Ct. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001) (SWANC). That would be a particularly ironic outcome, given that so many States have robust nondelegation doctrines designed to ensure democratic accountability in their state lawmaking processes. See R. May, The Nondelegation Doctrine is Alive and Well in the States, The Reg. Rev. (Oct. 15, 2020).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,151,"Much as constitutional rules about retroactive legislation and sovereign immunity have their corollary clear-statement rules, Article I's Vesting Clause has its own: the major questions doctrine. See Gundy, 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2141-2142 (GORSUCH, J., dissenting). Some version of this clear-statement rule can be traced to at least 1897, when this Court confronted a case involving the Interstate Commerce Commission, the federal government's first modern regulatory agency. S. Dudley, Milestones in the Evolution of the Administrative State 3 (Nov. 2020). The ICC argued that Congress had endowed it with the power to set carriage prices for railroads. See ICC v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 167 U.S. 479, 499, 17 S.Ct. 896, 42 L.Ed. 243 (1897). The Court deemed that claimed authority a power of supreme delicacy and importance, given the role railroads then played in the Nation's life. Id., at 505, 17 S.Ct. 896. Therefore, the Court explained, a special rule applied:",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,152,"That Congress has transferred such a power to any administrative body is not to be presumed or implied from any doubtful and uncertain language. The words and phrases efficacious to make such a delegation of power are well understood, and have been frequently used, and if Congress had intended to grant such a power to the agency, it cannot be doubted that it would have used language open to no misconstruction, but clear and direct. Ibid. (emphasis added).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,153,"With the explosive growth of the administrative state since 1970, the major questions doctrine soon took on special importance.2 In 1980, this Court held it unreasonable to assume that Congress gave an agency unprecedented powers in the absence of a clear legislative mandate. Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 645, 100 S.Ct. 2844, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (plurality opinion). In the years that followed, the Court routinely enforced the non-delegation doctrine through the interpretation of statutory texts, and, more particularly, by giving narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be unconstitutional. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373, n. 7, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). In fact, this Court applied the major questions doctrine in all corners of the administrative state, whether the issue at hand involved an agency's asserted power to regulate tobacco products, ban drugs used in physician-assisted suicide, extend Clean Air Act regulations to private homes, impose an eviction moratorium, or enforce a vaccine mandate. Ante, at 2608, see FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 160, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000), Gonzales v.

2021-045,155,"The Court has applied the major questions doctrine for the same reason it has applied other similar clear-statement rules—to ensure that the government does not inadvertently cross constitutional lines. Barrett 175. And the constitutional lines at stake here are surely no less important than those this Court has long held sufficient to justify parallel clear-statement rules. At stake is not just a question of retroactive liability or sovereign immunity, but basic questions about self-government, equality, fair notice, federalism, and the separation of powers. See Part I-A, supra. The major questions doctrine seeks to protect against unintentional, oblique, or otherwise unlikely intrusions on these interests. NFIB v. OSHA, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 669 (GORSUCH, J., concurring). The doctrine does so by ensuring that, when agencies seek to resolve major questions, they at least act with clear congressional authorization and do not exploit some gap, ambiguity, or doubtful expression in Congress's statutes to assume responsibilities far beyond those the people's representatives actually conferred on them. Ibid. As the Court aptly summarizes it today, the doctrine addresses a particular and recurring problem: agencies asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted. Ante, at 2609.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,158,"Turning from the doctrine's function to its application, it seems to me that our cases supply a good deal of guidance about when an agency action involves a major question for which clear congressional authority is required.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,159,"First, this Court has indicated that the doctrine applies when an agency claims the power to resolve a matter of great political significance, NFIB v. OSHA, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 665 (internal quotation marks omitted), or end an earnest and profound debate across the country, Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 267-268, 126 S.Ct. 904 (internal quotation marks omitted), see ante, at 2608. So, for example, in Gonzales, the Court found that the doctrine applied when the Attorney General issued a regulation that would have effectively banned most forms of physician-assisted suicide even as certain States were considering whether to permit the practice. 546 U.S. at 267, 126 S.Ct. 904. And in NFIB v. OSHA, the Court held the doctrine applied when an agency sought to mandate COVID-19 vaccines nationwide for most workers at a time when Congress and state legislatures were engaged in robust debates over vaccine mandates. 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 664-665, id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 667-668 (GORSUCH, J., concurring). Relatedly, this Court has  found it telling when Congress has `considered and rejected' bills authorizing something akin to the agency's proposed course of action. Ante, at 2609-2610, 2613-2614 (quoting Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 144, 120 S.Ct. 1291). That too may be a sign that an agency is attempting to `work around' the legislative process to resolve for itself a question of great political significance. NFIB v. OSHA, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 667-668 (GORSUCH, J., concurring).4",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,160,"Second, this Court has said that an agency must point to clear congressional authorization when it seeks to regulate `a significant portion of the American economy,' ante, at 2608-2609 (quoting Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427), or require billions of dollars in spending by private persons or entities, King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 192 L.Ed.2d 483 (2015). The Court has held that regulating tobacco products, eliminating rate regulation in the telecommunications industry, subjecting private homes to Clean Air Act restrictions, and suspending local housing laws and regulations can sometimes check this box. See Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 160, 120 S.Ct. 1291, MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231, 114 S.Ct. 2223, 129 L.Ed.2d 182 (1994) (MCI), Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427, Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594 U.

2021-045,161,"Third, this Court has said that the major questions doctrine may apply when an agency seeks to intrude into an area that is the particular domain of state law. Ibid. Of course, another longstanding clear-statement rule—the federalism canon —also applies in these situations. To preserve the proper balance between the States and the Federal Government and enforce limits on Congress's Commerce Clause power, courts must `be certain of Congress's intent' before finding that it legislated in areas traditionally regulated by the States. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 459-460, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991). But unsurprisingly, the major questions doctrine and the federalism canon often travel together. When an agency claims the power to regulate vast swaths of American life, it not only risks intruding on Congress's power, it also risks intruding on powers reserved to the States. See SWANC, 531 U.S. at 162, 174, 121 S.Ct. 675.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,162,"While this list of triggers may not be exclusive, each of the signs the Court has found significant in the past is present here, making this a relatively easy case for the doctrine's application. The EPA claims the power to force coal and gas-fired power plants to cease operating altogether. Ante, at 2612. Whether these plants should be allowed to operate is a question on which people today may disagree, but it is a question everyone can agree is vitally important. See ante, at 2612-2613. Congress has debated the matter frequently. Ibid., see generally Climate Change, The History of a Consensus and the Causes of Inaction, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Environment of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. I (2019). And so far it has conspicuously and repeatedly declined to adopt legislation similar to the Clean Power  Plan (CPP). Ante, at 2610, see American Lung Assn. v. EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 998, n. 19 (CADC 2021) (Walker, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (cataloguing failed legislative proposals), cf. Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 144, 120 S.Ct. 1291. It seems that fact has frustrated the Executive Branch and led it to attempt its own regulatory solution in the CPP. See 985 F.3d at 998, n. 20 (President stating that `if Congress won't act soon  I will'), cf. United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 855 F.3d 381, 423-424 (CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (noting a President's intervention may underscore the enormous significance of a regulation).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,163,"Other suggestive factors are present too. The electric power sector is among the largest in the U. S. economy, with links to every other sector. N. Richardson, Keeping Big Cases From Making Bad Law: The Resurgent Major Questions Doctrine, 49 Conn. L. Rev. 355, 388 (2016). The Executive Branch has acknowledged that its proposed rule would force an aggressive transformation of the electricity sector through transition to zero-carbon renewable energy sources. White House Fact Sheet, App. in American Lung Assn. v. EPA, No. 19-1140 (CADC), pp. 2076-2077. The Executive Branch has also predicted its rule would force dozens of power plants to close and eliminate thousands of jobs by 2025. See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Clean Power Plan Final Rule 3-27, 3-30, 3-33, 6-25 (Oct. 23, 2015). And industry analysts have estimated the CPP would cause consumers' electricity costs to rise by over $200 billion. See National Mining Assn., EPA's Clean Power Plan: An Economic Impact Analysis 2, 4 (2015). Finally, the CPP unquestionably has an impact on federalism, as the regulation of utilities is one of the most important of the functions traditionally associated with the police power of the States. Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 375, 377, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 76 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983). None of this is to say the policy the agency seeks to pursue is unwise or should not be pursued. It is only to say that the agency seeks to resolve for itself the sort of question normally reserved for Congress. As a result, we look for clear evidence that the people's representatives in Congress have actually afforded the agency the power it claims.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,165,"At this point, the question becomes what qualifies as a clear congressional statement authorizing an agency's action. Courts have long experience applying clear-statement rules throughout the law, and our cases have identified several telling clues in this context too.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,166,"First, courts must look to the legislative provisions on which the agency seeks to rely `with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.' Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Oblique or elliptical language will not supply a clear statement. Ante, at 2609, see Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119, 139, 125 S.Ct. 2169, 162 L.Ed.2d 97 (2005) (plurality opinion) (cautioning against reliance on broad or general language). Nor may agencies seek to hide elephants in mouseholes, Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001), or rely on gap filler provisions, ante, at 2610. So, for example, in MCI this Court rejected the Federal Communication Commission's attempt to eliminate rate regulation for the telecommunications industry based on a subtle provision that empowered the FCC to `modify' rates. 512 U.S. at 231, 114 S.Ct. 2223. In Brown & Williamson, the Court rejected the  Food and Drug Administration's attempt to regulate cigarettes based a cryptic statutory provision that granted the agency the power to regulate drugs and devices. 529 U.S. at 126, 156, 160, 120 S.Ct. 1291. And in Gonzales, the Court doubted that Congress gave the Attorney General broad and unusual authority to regulate drugs for physician-assisted suicide through oblique statutory language. 546 U.S. at 267, 126 S.Ct. 904.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,167,"Second, courts may examine the age and focus of the statute the agency invokes in relation to the problem the agency seeks to address. As the Court puts it today, it is unlikely that Congress will make an extraordinary grant of regulatory authority through vague language in `a long-extant statute.' Ante, at 2608-2610 (quoting Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427). Recently, too, this Court found a clear statement lacking when OSHA sought to impose a nationwide COVID-19 vaccine mandate based on a statutory provision that was adopted 40 years before the pandemic and that focused on conditions specific to the workplace rather than a problem faced by society at large. See NFIB v. OSHA, 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 667-668 (GORSUCH, J., concurring). Of course, sometimes old statutes may be written in ways that apply to new and previously unanticipated situations. See Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 499, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). But an agency's attempt to deploy an old statute focused on one problem to solve a new and different problem may also be a warning sign that it is acting without clear congressional authority. See ante, at 2608-2609.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,168,"Third, courts may examine the agency's past interpretations of the relevant statute. See ante, at 2609-2610. A contemporaneous and long-held Executive Branch interpretation of a statute is entitled to some weight as evidence of the statute's original charge to an agency. United States v. Philbrick, 120 U.S. 52, 59, 7 S.Ct. 413, 30 L.Ed. 559 (1887). Conversely, in NFIB v. OSHA, the Court found it telling that OSHA, in its half century of existence, had never before adopted a broad public health regulation under the statute that the agency sought to invoke as authority for a nationwide vaccine mandate. 595 U. S., at ___ 142 S.Ct., at 666, ante, at 2608-2609, see also Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 158-159, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (noting that for decades the FDA had said it lacked statutory power to regulate cigarettes). As the Court states today, `the want of an assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert' to it is `significant in determining whether such power was actually conferred.' Ante, at 2610. When an agency claims to have found a previously unheralded power, its assertion generally warrants a measure of skepticism. Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-045,169,"Fourth, skepticism may be merited when there is a mismatch between an agency's challenged action and its congressionally assigned mission and expertise. Ante, at 2612-2613. As the Court explains, when an agency has no comparative expertise in making certain policy judgments,  Congress presumably would not task it with doing so. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). So, for example, in Alabama Assn. of Realtors, this Court rejected an attempt by a public health agency to regulate housing. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2488. And in NFIB v. OSHA, the Court rejected an effort by a workplace safety agency to ordain broad public health measures that fell outside its sphere of expertise. 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 665.5  Asking these questions again yields a clear answer in our case. See ante, at 2614-2616. As the Court details, the agency before us cites no specific statutory authority allowing it to transform the Nation's electrical power supply. See ante, at 2614. Instead, the agency relies on a rarely invoked statutory provision that was passed with little debate and has been characterized as an obscure, never-used section of the law. Ante, at 2602 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor has the agency previously interpreted the relevant provision to confer on it such vast authority, there is no original, longstanding, and consistent interpretation meriting judicial respect. See ante, at 2609-2611.

Ante, at 2612. Such a claimed power requires technical and policy expertise not traditionally needed in the EPA's regulatory development. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

2021-045,179,"Congress charged EPA with addressing those potentially catastrophic harms, including through regulation of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to regulate stationary sources of any substance that causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution and that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. 42 U. S. C. § 7411(b)(1)(A). Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases fit that description. See American Elec. Power, 564 U.S. at 416-417, 131 S.Ct. 2527, Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528-532, 127 S.Ct. 1438. EPA thus serves as the Nation's primary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. American Elec. Power, 564 U.S. at 428, 131 S.Ct. 2527. And among the most significant of the entities it regulates are fossil-fuel-fired (mainly coal- and natural-gas-fired) power plants. Today, those electricity-producing plants are responsible for about one quarter of the Nation's greenhouse gas emissions. See EPA, Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Apr. 14, 2022), https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions. Curbing that output is a necessary part of any effective approach for addressing climate change.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,180,"To carry out its Section 111 responsibility, EPA issued the Clean Power Plan in 2015. The premise of the Plan—which no one really disputes—was that operational improvements at the individual-plant level would either lead to only small emission reductions or would cost far more than a readily available regulatory alternative. 80 Fed. Reg. 64727-64728 (2015). That alternative —which fossil-fuel-fired plants were already using to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions in a cost effective manner —is called generation shifting. Id., at 64728, 64769. As the Court explains, the term refers to ways of shifting electricity generation from higher emitting sources to lower emitting ones—more specifically, from coal-fired to natural-gas-fired sources, and from both to renewable sources like solar and wind. See ante, at 2603. A power company (like the many supporting EPA here) might divert its own resources to a cleaner source, or might participate in a cap-and-trade system with other companies to achieve the same emissions-reduction goals.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,181,"This Court has obstructed EPA's effort from the beginning. Right after the Obama administration issued the Clean Power Plan, the Court stayed its implementation. That action was unprecedented: Never before had the Court stayed a regulation then under review in the lower courts. See Reply Brief for 29 States and State Agencies in No. 15A773, p. 33 (conceding the point). The effect of the Court's order, followed by the Trump administration's repeal of the rule, was that the Clean Power Plan never went into effect. The ensuing years, though, proved the Plan's moderation. Market forces alone caused the power  industry to meet the Plan's nationwide emissions target—through exactly the kinds of generation shifting the Plan contemplated. See 84 Fed. Reg. 32561-32562 (2019), Brief for United States 47. So by the time yet another President took office, the Plan had become, as a practical matter, obsolete. For that reason, the Biden administration announced that, instead of putting the Plan into effect, it would commence a new rulemaking. Yet this Court determined to pronounce on the legality of the old rule anyway. The Court may be right that doing so does not violate Article III mootness rules (which are notoriously strict). See ante, at 2606-2608. But the Court's docket is discretionary, and because no one is now subject to the Clean Power Plan's terms, there was no reason to reach out to decide this case. The Court today issues what is really an advisory opinion on the proper scope of the new rule EPA is considering. That new rule will be subject anyway to immediate, pre-enforcement judicial review. But this Court could not wait—even to see what the new rule says—to constrain EPA's efforts to address climate change.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,182,"The limits the majority now puts on EPA's authority fly in the face of the statute Congress wrote. The majority says it is simply not plausible that Congress enabled EPA to regulate power plants' emissions through generation shifting. Ante, at 2615-2616. But that is just what Congress did when it broadly authorized EPA in Section 111 to select the best system of emission reduction for power plants. § 7411(a)(1). The best system full stop—no ifs, ands, or buts of any kind relevant here. The parties do not dispute that generation shifting is indeed the best system—the most effective and efficient way to reduce power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. And no other provision in the Clean Air Act suggests that Congress meant to foreclose EPA from selecting that system, to the contrary, the Plan's regulatory approach fits hand-in-glove with the rest of the statute. The majority's decision rests on one claim alone: that generation shifting is just too new and too big a deal for Congress to have authorized it in Section 111's general terms. But that is wrong. A key reason Congress makes broad delegations like Section 111 is so an agency can respond, appropriately and commensurately, to new and big problems. Congress knows what it doesn't and can't know when it drafts a statute, and Congress therefore gives an expert agency the power to address issues—even significant ones—as and when they arise. That is what Congress did in enacting Section 111. The majority today overrides that legislative choice. In so doing, it deprives EPA of the power needed—and the power granted —to curb the emission of greenhouse gases.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,184,"The Clean Air Act was major legislation, designed to deal with a major public policy issue. As Congress explained, its goal was to speed up, expand, and intensify the war against air pollution in all its forms. H. R. Rep. No. 91-1146, p. 1 (1970). Or as this Court similarly recognized, the Act was a drastic remedy to what was perceived as a serious and otherwise uncheckable problem. Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 96 S.Ct. 2518, 49 L.Ed.2d 474, 256 (1976). The Act, as the majority describes, established three major regulatory programs to control air pollution from stationary sources like power plants. See ante, at 2599-2602. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) programs prescribe standards for specified pollutants, not including carbon dioxide. Section 111's New Source Performance Standards program provides an additional tool for  regulating emissions from categories of stationary sources deemed to contribute significantly to pollution. As applied to existing (not new) sources, the program mandates —via Section 111(d)—that EPA set emissions levels for pollutants not covered by the NAAQS or HAP programs, including carbon dioxide.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,185,"Section 111(d) thus ensures that EPA regulates existing power plants' emissions of all pollutants. When the pollutant at issue falls within the NAAQS or HAP programs, EPA need do no more. But when the pollutant falls outside those programs, Section 111(d) requires EPA to set an emissions level for currently operating power plants (and other stationary sources). That means no pollutant from such a source can go unregulated: As the Senate Report explained, Section 111(d) guarantees that there should be no gaps in control activities pertaining to stationary source emissions that pose any significant danger to public health or welfare. S. Rep. No. 91-1196, p. 20 (1970). Reflecting that language, the majority calls Section 111(d) a gap-filler. Ante, at 2601. It might also be thought of as a backstop or catch-all provision, protecting against pollutants that the NAAQS and HAP programs let go by. But the section is not, as the majority further claims, an ancillary provision or a statutory backwater. Ante, at 2609-2610, 2613. That characterization is a non-sequitur. That something is a backstop does not make it a backwater. Even if they are needed only infrequently, see ante, at 2601-2602, 2609 2610, backstops can perform a critical function—and this one surely does. Again, Section 111(d) tells EPA that when a pollutant —like carbon dioxide—is not regulated through other programs, EPA must undertake a further regulatory effort to control that substance's emission from existing stationary sources. In that way, Section 111(d) operates to ensure that the Act achieves comprehensive pollution control.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,186,"Section 111 describes the prescribed regulatory effort in expansive terms. EPA must set for the relevant source (here, fossil-fuel-fired power plants) and the relevant pollutant (here, carbon dioxide) an emission level—more particularly,",Kagan,0,
2021-045,187,the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the EPA Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated. § 7411(a)(1).,Kagan,0,
2021-045,188,"To take that language apart a bit, the provision instructs EPA to decide upon the best system of emission reduction which has been adequately demonstrated. The provision tells EPA, in making that determination, to take account of both costs and varied nonair impacts (on health, the environment, and the supply of energy). And the provision finally directs EPA to set the particular emissions limit achievable through use of the demonstrated best system. Taken as a whole, the section provides regulatory flexibility and discretion. It imposes, to be sure, meaningful constraints: Take into account costs and nonair impacts, and make sure the best system has a proven track record.1 But the core command—go find the best system of emission reduction—gives broad authority to EPA.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,189,"If that flexibility is not apparent on the provision's face, consider some dictionary definitions—supposedly a staple of this  Court's supposedly textualist method of reading statutes. A system is a complex unity formed of many often diverse parts subject to a common plan or serving a common purpose. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2322 (1971). Or again: a system is an organized and coordinated method, a procedure. American Heritage Dictionary 1768 (5th ed. 2018). The majority complains that a similar definition—cited to the Solicitor General's brief but originally from another dictionary —is just too darn broad. Ante, at 2614, see Brief for United States 31 (quoting Webster's New International Dictionary 2562 (2d ed. 1959)). Almost anything capable of reducing emissions, the majority says, could constitute such a `system' of emission reduction. Ante, at 2614. But that is rather the point. Congress used an obviously broad word (though surrounding it with constraints, see supra, at 2629-2630) to give EPA lots of latitude in deciding how to set emissions limits. And contra the majority, a broad term is not the same thing as a vague one. Ante, at 2609, 2609-2610, 2614. A broad term is comprehensive, extensive, wide-ranging, a vague term is unclear, ambiguous, hazy. (Once again, dictionaries would tell the tale.) So EPA was quite right in stating in the Clean Power Plan that the plain meaning of the term system in Section 111 refers to a set of measures that work together to reduce emissions. 80 Fed. Reg. 64762. Another of this Court's opinions, involving a matter other than the bogeyman of environmental regulation, might have stopped there.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,190,"For generation shifting fits comfortably within the conventional meaning of a system of emission reduction. Consider one of the most common mechanisms of generation shifting: the use of a cap-and-trade scheme. Here is how the majority describes cap and trade: Under such a scheme, sources that receive a reduction in their emissions can sell a credit representing the value of that reduction to others, who are able to count it toward their own applicable emissions caps. Ante, at 2603-2604. Does that sound like a system to you? It does to me too. And it also has to this Court. In the past, we have explained that this type of `cap-and-trade' system cuts costs while still reducing pollution to target levels. EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 U.S. 489, 503, n. 10, 134 S.Ct. 1584, 188 L.Ed.2d 775 (2014) (emphasis added). So what does the majority mean when it says that as a matter of definitional possibilities, generation shifting can be described as a `system'? Ante, at 2614 (emphasis added, citation and some internal quotation marks omitted). Rarely has a statutory term so clearly applied.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,191,"Other statutory provisions confirm the point. The Clean Air Act's acid rain provision, for example, describes a cap-and-trade program as an emission allocation and transfer system. § 7651(b) (emphasis added). So a system, according to the statute's own usage, includes the kind of cap-and-trade mechanism that the Clean Power Plan relied on. And in a somewhat different way, the NAAQS provision shows that Section 111 encompasses such a regulatory technique. Under that provision, cap-and-trade schemes qualify as control measures, means, or techniques that state plans may use to reduce emissions. § 7410(a)(2)(A). That language, of course, does not use the word system. But in specifying that cap and trade is allowable under the NAAQS program, the provision supports the same conclusion here—because Section 111 directs EPA to use a procedure similar to that provided by the NAAQS. § 7411(d)(1). The majority discounts the relevance of both those provisions on the ground that they contemplate trading systems only as a means of complying  with an already established emissions limit. Ante, at 2615 (emphasis in original). That is a distinction, to be sure. But to begin, it is far less of one than the majority thinks: In arguing that EPA's claim of authority here would allow it to take the emissions limit as low as it wants, the majority ignores the varied constraints surrounding the best system language. See supra, at 2629-2630. And still more important for interpretive purposes, the distinction appears only in the majority's opinion, not in any statutory language. That text, to the contrary, says to EPA: Do as you would do under the NAAQS and Acid Rain programs—go ahead and use cap and trade.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,192,"There is also a flipside point: Congress declined to include in Section 111 the restrictions on EPA's authority contained in other Clean Air Act provisions. Most relevant here, quite a number of statutory sections confine EPA's emissions-reduction efforts to technological controls—essentially, equipment or processes that can be put into place at a particular facility. See ante, at 2600-2601 (describing those controls). So, for example, one provision tells EPA to set standards reflecting the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology. § 7521(a)(3)(A)(i). Others direct the use of the best available retrofit technology, or the best available control technology, or the maximum achievable control technology. §§ 7491(b)(2)(A), (g)(2), 7475(a)(4), 7479(3), 7412(g)(2). There are still more. See, e.g., §§ 7411(h), 7511a(c)(7), 7651f(b)(2). None of those provisions would allow EPA to set emissions limits based on generation shifting, as the Agency acknowledges. See Brief for United States 32-33. But nothing like the language of those provisions is included in Section 111. That matters under normal rules of statutory interpretation. As Justice Scalia once wrote for the Court: We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply, and our reluctance is even greater when Congress has shown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how to make such a requirement manifest. Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 341, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,193,"Statutory history serves only to pile on: It shows that Congress has specifically declined to restrict EPA to technology-based controls in its regulation of existing stationary sources. The key moment came in 1977, when Congress amended Section 111 to distinguish between new sources and existing ones. For new sources, EPA could select only the best technological system of continuous emission reduction. Clean Air Act Amendments, § 109(c)(1)(A), 91 Stat. 700 (emphasis added). But for existing sources, the word technological was struck out: EPA could select the best system of continuous emission reduction. Ibid. The House Report emphasized Congress's deliberate choice: Whereas the standards set for new sources were to be based on the best technological controls, the standards adopted for existing sources were to be based on available means of emission control (not necessarily technological). H. R. Rep. No. 95-564, p. 129 (1977). The Report did not further explain the distinction. But presumably Congress gave EPA more flexibility over existing plants because imposing technological controls on old facilities is often not cost-effective.2 Thirteen years later,  Congress followed up by deleting from Section 111 the technological limitation applying to new facilities. See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, § 403(a), 104 Stat. 2631. Once again, then, Congress faced a choice: confine EPA to technological controls, or not. And replicating its earlier action for existing sources, Congress chose not.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,194,"The majority breezes past that congressional choice on the ground that today's opinion does not resolve whether EPA can regulate in some non-technological ways, instead, the opinion says only that the Clean Power Plan goes too far. See ante, at 2615-2616. That is a puzzling point. As an initial matter, it recharacterizes what this case has always been about. The Trump administration repealed the Clean Power Plan for one central reason: because (in its view) Section 111 confines EPA to facility-specific, technological measures. See 84 Fed. Reg. 32523-32529. In reviewing that repeal, the court below thus addressed that limit alone. See American Lung Assn. v. EPA, 985 F.3d 914, 944 (CADC 2021). So add to the oddity of the Court's declaring a defunct regulation unlawful, see supra, at 2627-2628, the irregularity of its suggesting some kind of non-technological limit that no one (not EPA, not the parties, not the court below) has ever considered. More important here, both the nature and the statutory basis of that limit are left a mystery. If the majority is not distinguishing between technological controls and all others, what is it doing—and how far does its opinion constrain EPA? The majority makes no effort to say. And because that is so, the majority cannot even attempt to ground its limit in the statutory language. I've just shown that restricting EPA to technological controls is inconsistent with Section 111, especially when read in conjunction with other statutory provisions. And the majority provides no reason to think that its (possibly) different limit fares any better. Section 111 does not impose any constraints—technological or otherwise— on EPA's authority to regulate stationary sources (except for those stated, like cost). In somehow (and to some extent) saying otherwise, the majority flouts the statutory text.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,195,"Congress, this Court has said, knows to speak in plain terms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capacious terms when it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion. Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 296, 133 S.Ct. 1863, 185 L.Ed.2d 941 (2013). In Section 111, Congress spoke in capacious terms. It knew that without regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and scientific developments would soon render the Clean Air Act obsolete. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 532, 127 S.Ct. 1438. So the provision enables EPA to base emissions limits for existing stationary sources on the best system. That system may be technological in nature, it may be whatever else the majority has in mind, or, most important here, it may be generation shifting. The statute does not care. And when Congress uses expansive language to authorize agency action, courts generally may not impose limits on the agency's discretion. Little Sisters of the Poor  Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2367, 2380-2381 (2020). That constraint on judicial authority—that insistence on judicial modesty—should resolve this case.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,197,"The majority thinks not, contending that in certain extraordinary cases—of which this is one—courts should start off with skepticism that a broad delegation authorizes agency action. Ante, at 2609. The majority labels that view the major questions doctrine, and claims to find support for it in our caselaw. Ante, at 2609-2610, 2614. But the relevant decisions do normal statutory interpretation: In them, the Court simply insisted that the text of a broad delegation, like any other statute, should be read in context, and with a modicum of common sense. Using that ordinary method, the decisions struck down agency actions (even though they plausibly fit within a delegation's terms) for two principal reasons. First, an agency was operating far outside its traditional lane, so that it had no viable claim of expertise or experience. And second, the action, if allowed, would have conflicted with, or even wreaked havoc on, Congress's broader design. In short, the assertion of delegated power was a misfit for both the agency and the statutory scheme. But that is not true here. The Clean Power Plan falls within EPA's wheelhouse, and it fits perfectly— as I've just shown—with all the Clean Air Act's provisions. That the Plan addresses major issues of public policy does not upend the analysis. Congress wanted EPA to do just that. Section 111 entrusts important matters to EPA in the expectation that the Agency will use that authority to combat pollution—and that courts will not interfere.",Kagan,0,

We do not assess the meaning of a single word, phrase, or provision in isolation, we also consider the overall statutory design. And that is just as true of statutes broadly delegating power to agencies as of any other kind. In deciding on the scope of such a delegation, courts must assess how an agency action claimed to fall within the provision fits with other aspects of a statutory plan.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,200,"So too, a court must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate. Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Assume that a policy decision, like this one, is a matter of significant economic and political magnitude. Ibid. We know that Congress delegates such decisions to agencies all the time—and often via broadly framed provisions like Section 111. See infra, at 2641-2643. But Congress does so in a sensible way. To decide whether an agency action goes beyond what Congress wanted, courts must assess (among other potentially relevant factors) the nature of the regulation, the nature of the agency, and the relationship of the two to each other. See, e.g., Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 222, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002). In particular, we have understood, Congress does not usually grant agencies the authority to decide significant issues on which they have no particular expertise. So when there is a mismatch between the agency's usual portfolio and a given assertion of power, courts have reason to question whether Congress intended a delegation to go so far.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,201,"The majority today goes beyond those sensible principles. It announces the arrival  of the major questions doctrine, which replaces normal text-in-context statutory interpretation with some tougher-to-satisfy set of rules. Ante, at 2607-2616. Apparently, there is now a two-step inquiry. First, a court must decide, by looking at some panoply of factors, whether agency action presents an extraordinary case. Ante, at 2608, see ante, at 2609-2614. If it does, the agency must point to clear congressional authorization for the power it claims, someplace over and above the normal statutory basis we require. Ante, at 2609 (internal quotation marks omitted), see ante, at 2614-2616. The result is statutory interpretation of an unusual kind. It is not until page 28 of a 31-page opinion that the majority begins to seriously discuss the meaning of Section 111. And even then, it does not address straight-up what should be the question: Does the text of that provision, when read in context and with a common-sense awareness of how Congress delegates, authorize the agency action here?",Kagan,0,
2021-045,202,"The majority claims it is just following precedent, but that is not so. The Court has never even used the term major questions doctrine before. And in the relevant cases, the Court has done statutory construction of a familiar sort. It has looked to the text of a delegation. It has addressed how an agency's view of that text works— or fails to do so—in the context of a broader statutory scheme. And it has asked, in a common-sensical (or call it purposive) vein, about what Congress would have made of the agency's view—otherwise said, whether Congress would naturally have delegated authority over some important question to the agency, given its expertise and experience. In short, in assessing the scope of a delegation, the Court has considered —without multiple steps, triggers, or special presumptions—the fit between the power claimed, the agency claiming it, and the broader statutory design.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,203,"The key case here is FDA v. Brown & Williamson. There, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asserted that its power to regulate drugs and devices extended to tobacco products. The claim had something to it: FDA has broad authority over drugs and drug-delivery devices, and the definitions of those terms could be read to encompass nicotine and cigarettes. But the asserted authority simply did not fit the overall statutory scheme. 529 U.S. at 143, 120 S.Ct. 1291. FDA's governing statute required the agency to ensure that regulated products were safe to be marketed—but there was no making tobacco products safe in the usual sense. Id., at 133-143, 120 S.Ct. 1291. So FDA would have had to reinterpret what it meant to be safe, or else ban tobacco products altogether. Ibid. Both options, the Court thought, were preposterous. Until the agency action at issue, tobacco products hadn't been spoken of in the same breath as pharmaceuticals (FDA's paradigmatic regulated product). And Congress had created in several statutes a distinct regulatory scheme for tobacco, not involving FDA. Id., at 155-156, 120 S.Ct. 1291. So all the evidence was that Congress had never meant for FDA to have any—let alone total—control over the tobacco industry, with its unique political history. Id., at 159, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Again, there was simply a lack of fit between the regulation at issue, the agency in question, and the broader statutory scheme. Id., at 143, 120 S.Ct. 1291.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,204,"The majority's effort to find support in Brown & Williamson for its interpretive approach fails. See ante, at 2609. It may be helpful here to quote the full sentence that the majority quotes half of. In extraordinary cases, the Court stated, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. 529 U.S. at 159, 120 S.Ct.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,205,"1291. For anyone familiar with this Court's Chevron doctrine, that language will ring a bell. The Court was saying only—and it was elsewhere explicit on this point—that there was reason to hesitate before giving FDA's position Chevron deference. See id., at 132-133, 159-161, 120 S.Ct. 1291. And what was that reason? The Court went on to explain that it would not defer to FDA because it read the relevant statutory provisions as negating the agency's claimed authority. See id., at 160, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (We are obliged to defer not to the agency's expansive construction of the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment to deny the FDA this power), id., at 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (finding at Chevron's first step that Congress has directly spoken to the issue here and precluded the FDA's asserted power). In reaching that conclusion, the Court relied (as I've just explained) not on any special clear authorization demand, but on normal principles of statutory interpretation: look at the text, view it in context, and use what the Court called some common sense about how Congress delegates. Ibid. That is how courts are to decide, in the majority's language, whether an agency has asserted a highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted. Ante, at 2609.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,206,"The Court has applied the same kind of analysis in subsequent cases—holding in each that an agency exceeded the scope of a broadly framed delegation when it operated outside the sphere of its expertise, in a way that warped the statutory text or structure. In Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006), we rejected the Attorney General's assertion of authority (under a broad public interest standard) to rescind doctors' registrations for facilitating assisted suicide, even in States where doing so was legal. See id., at 243, 248-249, 261-275, 126 S.Ct. 904. We doubted Congress would have delegated such a quintessentially medical judgment to an executive official who lacks medical expertise. Id., at 266-267, 126 S.Ct. 904. And we pointed to statutory provisions in which Congress—in opposition to the claimed power—had painstakingly described the Attorney General's limited authority to deregister physicians. Id., at 262, 126 S.Ct. 904.3",Kagan,0,
2021-045,207,"Later, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 134 S.Ct. 2427, 189 L.Ed.2d 372 (2014), the Court relied on similar reasoning to reject EPA's efforts to regulate millions of small and previously unregulated sources of emissions—including retail stores, offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches. Id., at 328, 134 S.Ct. 2427. Key to that decision was the Court's view that reading the delegation so expansively would be inconsistent with the statute's broader structure and design. Id., at 321, 134 S.Ct. 2427. The Court explained that allowing the agency action to proceed would necessitate the rewriting of other unambiguous statutory terms—indeed, of precise numerical thresholds. Id., at 321, 325-326, 134 S.Ct. 2427. (In quoting one cryptic sentence of Utility Air as supporting its new approach, see ante, at 2609, the majority ignores the nine preceding pages of analysis of the statute's text and context, see 573 U.S. at 315-324, 134 S.Ct. 2427.)",Kagan,0,
2021-045,208,"And last Term, the Court concluded that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) lacked the power to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium. Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct. 2485, 2488-2490. The Court held that other statutory language made it a stretch to read the relied-on delegation as covering the CDC's action. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2488-2489. And the Court raised an eyebrow at the thought of the CDC intruding into the landlord-tenant relationship—a matter outside the CDC's usual domain. Ibid.4",Kagan,0,
2021-045,209,"The eyebrow-raise is indeed a consistent presence in these cases, responding to something the Court found anomalous— looked at from Congress's point of view— in a particular agency's exercise of authority. In each case, the Court thought, the agency had strayed out of its lane, to an area where it had neither expertise nor experience. The Attorney General making healthcare policy, the regulator of pharmaceutical concerns deciding the fate of the tobacco industry, and so on. And in each case, the proof that the agency had roamed too far afield lay in the statutory scheme itself. The agency action collided with other statutory provisions, if the former were allowed, the latter could not mean what they said or could not work as intended. FDA having to declare tobacco safe to avoid shutting down an industry, or EPA having literally to change hard numbers contained in the Clean Air Act. There, according to the Court, the statutory framework was not designed to grant the authority claimed. Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 324, 134 S.Ct. 2427. The agency's singular assertion of power would render the statute unrecognizable to the Congress that wrote it. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,211,"The Court today faces no such singular assertion of agency power. As I have already explained, nothing in the Clean Air Act (or, for that matter, any other statute) conflicts with EPA's reading of Section 111. Notably, the majority does not dispute that point. Of course, it views Section 111 (if for unexplained reasons) as less clear than I do. Compare ante, at 2614-2615, with supra, at 2629-2631. But nowhere does the majority provide evidence from within the statute itself that the Clean Power Plan conflicts with or undermines Congress's design. That fact alone makes this case different from all the cases described above. As to the other critical matter in those cases—is the agency operating outside its sphere of expertise?—the majority at least tries to say something. It claims EPA has no comparative expertise in balancing the many vital considerations of national policy implicated in regulating electricity sources. Ante, at 2612-2613. But that is wrong.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,212,"Start with what this Court has said before on the subject, reflecting Congress's view of the matter. About a decade ago, we recognized that Congress had delegated to EPA in Section 111 the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from powerplants. American Elec. Power, 564 U.S. at 426, 131 S.Ct. 2527. To stress the key word (because the majority seems to miss it, see ante, at 2613-2614): not merely whether but also how. In making that delegation, we explained, Congress knew well what it was doing. Regulating power plant emissions is a complex undertaking. To do it right requires informed assessment of competing interests: Along with the environmental  benefit potentially achievable, our Nation's energy needs and the possibility of economic disruption must weigh in the balance. 564 U.S. at 427, 131 S.Ct. 2527, see § 7411(a)(1) (instructing EPA to consider energy requirements, cost, and other factors). Congress specifically entrusted such complex balancing to EPA, because that expert agency has the needed scientific, economic, and technological resources to carry it out. 564 U.S. at 427-428, 131 S.Ct. 2527. So the balancing— including of the Nation's energy requirements —that the majority says EPA has no comparative expertise in? § 7411(a)(1), ante, at 2612-2613. We explained 11 short years ago, citing Congress, that it was smack in the middle of EPA's wheelhouse.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,213,"And we were right. Consider the Clean Power Plan's component parts—let's call them the what, who, and how—to see the rule's normalcy. The what is the subject matter of the Plan: carbon dioxide emissions. This Court has already found that those emissions fall within EPA's domain. We said then: There is nothing counterintuitive to the notion that EPA can curtail the emission of substances that are putting the global climate out of kilter. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 531, 127 S.Ct. 1438. This is not the Attorney General regulating medical care, or even the CDC regulating landlord-tenant relations. It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's who: fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. See supra, at 2635-2636. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide. See Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 78, 95 S.Ct. 1470, 43 L.Ed.2d 731 (1975).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,214,"Finally, the how of generation shifting creates no mismatch with EPA's expertise. As the Plan noted, generation shifting has a well-established pedigree as a tool for reducing pollution, even putting aside other federal regulation, see infra, at 2639-2640, both state regulators and power plants themselves have long used it to attain environmental goals. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64664, Brief for Power Company Respondents 47, see also S. Breyer, Regulation and Its Reform 444, n. 1 (1982) (citing literature on the subject from the 1970s). The technique is, so to speak, a tool in the pollution-control toolbox. And that toolbox is the one EPA uses. So that Agency, more than any other, has the desired comparative expertise. Ante, at 2612-2613. The majority cannot contest that point frontally: It knows that cap and trade and similar mechanisms are an ordinary part of modern environmental regulation. Instead, the majority protests that Congress would not have wanted EPA to dictate, through generation shifting, the mix of energy sources nationwide. Ante, at 2613. But that statement reflects a misunderstanding of how the electricity market works. Every regulation of power plants—even the most conventional, facility-specific controls— dictates the national energy mix to one or another degree. That result follows because regulations affect costs, and the electrical grid works by taking up energy from low-cost providers before high-cost ones. Consider an example: Suppose EPA requires coal-fired plants to use carbon-capture technology. That action increases those plants' costs, and automatically (by virtue of the way the grid operates) reduces their share of the electricity market. So EPA is always controlling the mix of energy sources. In that sense (though the  term has taken on a more specialized meaning), everything EPA does is generation shifting. The majority's idea that EPA has no warrant to direct such a shift just indicates that courts sometimes do not really get regulation.5",Kagan,0,
2021-045,215,"Why, then, be skeptical of EPA's exercise of authority? Ante, at 2614. When there is no misfit, of the kind apparent in our precedents, between the regulation, the agency, and the statutory design? Although the majority offers a flurry of complaints, they come down in the end to this: The Clean Power Plan is a big new thing, issued under a minor statutory provision. See ante, at 2609-2610, 2612, 2613 (labeling the Plan transformative and unprecedented and calling Section 111(d) an ancillary backwater). I have already addressed the back half of that argument: In fact, there is nothing insignificant about Section 111(d), which was intended to ensure that EPA would limit existing stationary sources' emissions of otherwise unregulated pollutants (however few or many there were). See supra, at 2629. And the front half of the argument doesn't work either. The Clean Power Plan was not so big. It was not so new. And to the extent it was either, that should not matter.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,216,"As to bigness—well, events have proved the opposite: The Clean Power Plan, we now know, would have had little or no impact. The Trump administration's repeal of the Plan created a kind of controlled experiment: The Plan's magnitude (ante, at 2612) could be measured by seeing how far short the industry fell of the Plan's nationwide emissions target. Except that turned out to be the wrong question, because the industry didn't fall short of the Plan's goal, rather, the industry exceeded that target, all on its own. See App. 265 (declaration of EPA official). And it did so mainly through the generation-shifting techniques that the Plan called for. See ibid., Brief for United States 47. In effect, the Plan predicted market behavior, rather than altered it (as regulations usually do). Cf. Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 321-322, 134 S.Ct. 2427 (discussing the calamitous consequences of the EPA approach there under review). And that fact has been understood for some years. At the time of the repeal, the Trump administration explained that there was likely to be no difference between a world where the Clean Power Plan was implemented and one where it was not. 84 Fed. Reg. 32561.6 It is small wonder, then, that the  power industry overwhelmingly supports EPA in this case. See Brief for Power Company Respondents 2-3. In the regulated parties' view, the rule aimed to achieve what most power companies also want: substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions accomplished in a cost-effective way while maintaining a reliable electricity market. See id., at 26-27, 38, 41-42.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,217,"The majority thus pivots to the massive consequences generation shifting could produce—but that claim fares just as poorly. On EPA's view of its own authority, the majority worries, some future rule might force coal plants to `shift' away virtually all of their generation—i.e., to cease making power altogether. Ante, at 2612. But looking at the text of Section 111(d) might here come in handy. For the statute imposes, as already shown, a set of constraints—particularly involving costs and energy needs—that would preclude so extreme a regulation. See Brief for United States 41-42 (conceding the point), supra, at 2629-2630. And if the majority thinks those constraints do not really constrain, then it has a much bigger problem. For traditional technological controls, of the kind the majority approves, can have equally dramatic effects. Ante, at 2611-2612. Take, for example, the fuel-switching regulation the majority mentions. Ibid. Such a rule does just what you might think: It requires a plant to burn a different kind of fuel—say, natural gas instead of coal. So it too can significantly restructure the Nation's overall mix of electricity generation. Ante, at 2607. Or take an even more technological-sounding approach: the use of carbon-capture equipment. Order the installation of that equipment, the Trump administration concluded, and the exorbitant costs would almost certainly force the closure of all affected coal-fired power plants. 84 Fed. Reg. 32548. The point is a simple one: If generation shifting can go big, so too can technological controls (assuming, once again, that the statute's text is ignored). The problem (if any exists) is not with the channel, but with the volume.7",Kagan,0,
2021-045,218,"The majority's claim about the Clean Power Plan's novelty—the most fleshed-out part of today's opinion, see ante, at 2609-2612 is also exaggerated. As EPA explained when it issued the Clean Power Plan, an earlier Section 111(d) regulation had determined that a cap-and-trade program was the best system of emission reduction for mercury. 70 Fed. Reg. 28616-28621 (2005), see 80 Fed. Reg. 64772. In the majority's view, that rule was different because the actual emission cap for the contemplated cap-and-trade scheme was based on the use of a plant-specific technology—namely, wet scrubbers. Ante, at 2610 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the approval of cap and trade allowed EPA to make the  emissions limits more stringent than it otherwise could have, because EPA knew that plants unable to cost-effectively install scrubbers could instead meet the limits through generation shifting. See 70 Fed. Reg. 28619. EPA could have designed the Clean Power Plan in the same way—say, by setting emissions limits based on carbon-capture technology, with the expectation that many plants would avail themselves of an approved cap-and-trade program instead. The majority gives no reason to think Section 111(d) allows that approach but disallows the Clean Power Plan. In both, generation shifting is operating to increase the strictness of emissions limits.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,219,"And the mercury rule itself was rooted in precedent. A decade earlier, EPA had determined that States could comply with a Section 111(d) regulation for municipal waste combustors by establishing cap-and-trade programs. See 40 CFR §§ 60.30a, 60.33b(d)(2) (1996). And beyond Section 111(d), trading and other tools of generation shifting become still more common. For decades, EPA has relied on those pollution-control techniques in rules covering new internal-combustion engines under Section 111(b), sources of nitrogen oxide under the NAAQS program, and motor vehicles under Section 202(a). See 73 Fed. Reg. 3595 (2008), 71 Fed. Reg. 39159 (2006), 63 Fed. Reg. 57358-57359 (1998), 48 Fed. Reg. 33456 (1983), see also Brief for Richard L. Revesz as Amicus Curiae 24-29 (collecting similar rules). No doubt the majority is right that scrubbers and other add-on controls are more traditional air pollution control measures. Ante, at 2611. EPA readily acknowledged that fact in developing the Clean Power Plan. But the idea that the Plan's reliance on generation shifting effected some kind of revolution in power-plant pollution control? No. As I've noted before, power plants themselves use that method. State environmental regulators use that method. And EPA has used that method, including under the statutory provision invoked here.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,220,"In any event, newness might be perfectly legitimate—even required—from Congress's point of view. I do not dispute that an agency's longstanding practice may inform a court's interpretation of a statute delegating the agency power. See ante, at 2609-2610. But it is equally true, as Brown & Williamson recognized, that agency practices are not carved in stone. 529 U.S. at 156-157, 120 S.Ct. 1291 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress makes broad delegations in part so that agencies can adapt their rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances. Id., at 157, 120 S.Ct. 1291. To keep faith with that congressional choice, courts must give agencies ample latitude to revisit, rethink, and revise their regulatory approaches. Ibid. So it is here. Section 111(d) was written, as I've shown, to give EPA plenty of leeway. See supra, at 2629-2630. The enacting Congress told EPA to pick the best system of emission reduction (taking into account various factors). In selecting those words, Congress understood—it had to—that the best system would change over time. Congress wanted and instructed EPA to keep up. To ensure the statute's continued effectiveness, the best system should evolve as circumstances evolved—in a way Congress knew it couldn't then know. See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 532, 127 S.Ct. 1438. EPA followed those statutory directions to the letter when it issued the Clean Power Plan. It selected a system (as the regulated parties agree) that achieved greater emissions reductions at lower cost than any technological alternative could have, while maintaining a reliable electricity market. Even if that system was novel, it was in EPA's view better—actually,  best. So it was the system that accorded with the enacting Congress's choice.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,221,"And contra the majority, it is that Congress's choice which counts, not any later one's. The majority says it cannot ignore that Congress in recent years has considered and rejected cap-and-trade schemes. Ante, at 2613-2614. But under normal principles of statutory construction, the majority should ignore that fact (just as I should ignore that Congress failed to enact bills barring EPA from implementing the Clean Power Plan). As we have explained time and again, failed legislation offers a particularly dangerous basis on which to rest an interpretation of an existing law a different and earlier Congress adopted. Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1731, 1747 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted), see Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 632, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part) (Arguments based on subsequent legislative history should not be taken seriously, not even in a footnote). Return to Brown & Williamson, which all agree is the key case in this sphere. It disclaimed any reliance on Congress' failure to grant FDA jurisdiction over tobacco. 529 U.S. at 155, 120 S.Ct. 1291. Instead, the Court focused on the statutes Congress had enacted, which created a distinct regulatory scheme for tobacco, incompatible with FDA's. Ibid. (emphasis added). Here, as I've shown and the majority effectively concedes, there is nothing equivalent. See supra, at 2630-2632. Search high and low, nothing in current law conflicts with, or otherwise casts doubt on, the Clean Power Plan. That leaves the Court in much the same place it was when deciding Massachusetts v. EPA. Said the Court then: That subsequent Congresses have eschewed enacting binding emissions limitations to combat global warming tells us nothing about what Congress meant when it enacted the Clean Air Act. 549 U.S. at 529-530, 127 S.Ct. 1438. And so the Court recognized EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide. But that Court was not this Court, and this Court deprives EPA of the authority Congress gave it in Section 111(d) to respond to the same environmental danger.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,223,"Some years ago, I remarked that we're all textualists now. Harvard Law School, The Antonin Scalia Lecture Series: A Dialogue with Justice Elena Kagan on the Reading of Statutes (Nov. 25, 2015). It seems I was wrong. The current Court is textualist only when being so suits it. When that method would frustrate broader goals, special canons like the major questions doctrine magically appear as get-out-of-text-free cards.8 Today, one of those broader goals makes itself clear: Prevent agencies from doing important work, even though that is what Congress directed. That anti-administrative-state stance shows up in the majority opinion, and it suffuses the concurrence. See ante, at 2609, 2612-2613, e.g., ante, at 2600-2602 (GORSUCH, J., concurring).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,224,"The kind of agency delegations at issue here go all the way back to this Nation's founding. The founding era, scholars  have shown, wasn't concerned about delegation. E. Posner & A. Vermeule, Interring the Nondelegation Doctrine, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1721, 1734 (2002) (Posner & Vermeule). The records of the Constitutional Convention, the ratification debates, the Federalist—none of them suggests any significant limit on Congress's capacity to delegate policymaking authority to the Executive Branch. And neither does any early practice. The very first Congress gave sweeping authority to the Executive Branch to resolve some of the day's most pressing problems, including questions of territorial administration, Indian affairs, foreign and domestic debt, military service, and the federal courts. J. Mortenson & N. Bagley, Delegation at the Founding, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 277, 349 (2021) (Mortenson & Bagley). That Congress, to use a few examples, gave the Executive power to devise a licensing scheme for trading with Indians, to craft appropriate laws for the Territories, and to decide how to pay down the (potentially ruinous) national debt. See id., at 334-338, 340-342, 344-345, C. Chabot, The Lost History of Delegation at the Founding, 56 Ga. L. Rev. 81, 113-134 (2021) (Chabot). Barely anyone objected on delegation grounds.

2021-045,225,"It is not surprising that Congress has always delegated, and continues to do so— including on important policy issues. As this Court has recognized, it is often unreasonable and impracticable for Congress to do anything else. American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946). In all times, but ever more in our increasingly complex society, the Legislature simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). Consider just two reasons why.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,226,"First, Members of Congress often don't know enough—and know they don't know enough—to regulate sensibly on an issue. Of course, Members can and do provide overall direction. But then they rely, as all of us rely in our daily lives, on people with greater expertise and experience. Those people are found in agencies. Congress looks to them to make specific judgments about how to achieve its more general objectives. And it does so especially, though by no means exclusively, when an issue has a scientific or technical dimension. Why wouldn't Congress instruct EPA to select the best system of emission reduction, rather than try to choose that system itself? Congress knows that systems of emission reduction lie not in its own but in EPA's unique expertise. Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 151, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,227,"Second and relatedly, Members of Congress often can't know enough—and again, know they can't—to keep regulatory schemes working across time. Congress usually can't predict the future—can't anticipate changing circumstances and the way they will affect varied regulatory techniques. Nor can Congress (realistically) keep track of and respond to fast-flowing developments as they occur. Once again, that is most obviously true when it comes to scientific and technical matters. The best system of emission reduction is not today what it was yesterday, and will surely be something different tomorrow. So for this reason too, a rational Congress delegates. It enables an agency to adapt old regulatory approaches to new times, to ensure that a statutory program remains effective. See, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA, 595 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 661, 674 (2022)  (BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting) (observing that a statute's broad language was meant to ensure that an agency had the tools needed to confront emerging dangers).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,228,"Over time, the administrative delegations Congress has made have helped to build a modern Nation. Congress wanted fewer workers killed in industrial accidents. It wanted to prevent plane crashes, and reduce the deadliness of car wrecks. It wanted to ensure that consumer products didn't catch fire. It wanted to stop the routine adulteration of food and improve the safety and efficacy of medications. And it wanted cleaner air and water. If an American could go back in time, she might be astonished by how much progress has occurred in all those areas. It didn't happen through legislation alone. It happened because Congress gave broad-ranging powers to administrative agencies, and those agencies then filled in—rule by rule by rule—Congress's policy outlines.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,229,"This Court has historically known enough not to get in the way. Maybe the best explanation of why comes from Justice Scalia. See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 415-416, 109 S.Ct. 647 (dissenting opinion). The context was somewhat different. He was responding to an argument that Congress could not constitutionally delegate broad policymaking authority, here, the Court reads a delegation with unwarranted skepticism, and thereby artificially constrains its scope. But Justice Scalia's reasoning remains on point. He started with the inevitability of delegations: Some judgments involving policy considerations, he stated, must be left to administrative officers. Id., at 415, 109 S.Ct. 647. Then he explained why courts should not try to seriously police those delegations, barring—or, I'll add, narrowing—some on the ground that they went too far. The scope of delegations, he said,",Kagan,0,
2021-045,230,"must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordination. Since Congress is no less endowed with common sense than we are, and better equipped to inform itself of the necessities of government, and since the factors bearing upon those necessities are both multifarious and (in the nonpartisan sense) highly political  it is small wonder that we have almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law. Id., at 416, 109 S.Ct. 647 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Kagan,0,
2021-045,231,"In short, when it comes to delegations, there are good reasons for Congress (within extremely broad limits) to get to call the shots. Congress knows about how government works in ways courts don't. More specifically, Congress knows what mix of legislative and administrative action conduces to good policy. Courts should be modest.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,232,"Today, the Court is not. Section 111, most naturally read, authorizes EPA to develop the Clean Power Plan—in other words, to decide that generation shifting is the best system of emission reduction for power plants churning out carbon dioxide. Evaluating systems of emission reduction is what EPA does. And nothing in the rest of the Clean Air Act, or any other statute, suggests that Congress did not mean for the delegation it wrote to go as far as the text says. In rewriting that text, the Court substitutes its own ideas about delegations for Congress's. And that means the Court substitutes its own ideas about policymaking for Congress's. The Court will not allow the Clean Air Act to work as Congress instructed. The Court, rather than Congress, will decide how much regulation is too much.",Kagan,0,
2021-045,233,"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.",Kagan,0,

2021-046,37,"A provision of the Controlled Substances Act, codified at 21 U.S.C. § 841, makes it a federal crime, except as authorized, for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, or dispense  a controlled substance, such as opioids. 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) (emphasis added). Registered doctors may prescribe these substances to their patients. But, as provided by regulation, a prescription is only authorized when a doctor issues it for a legitimate medical purpose acting in the usual course of his professional practice. 21 C.F.R. § 1306.04(a) (2021).",Breyer,0,
2021-046,38,"In each of these two consolidated cases, a doctor was convicted under § 841 for dispensing controlled substances not as authorized. The question before us concerns the state of mind that the Government must prove to convict these doctors of violating the statute. We hold that the statute's knowingly or intentionally mens rea applies to authorization. After a defendant produces evidence that he or she was authorized to dispense controlled substances, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that he or she was acting in an unauthorized manner, or intended to do so.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,40,"The question we face concerns § 841's exception from the general prohibition on dispensing controlled substances contained in the phrase except as authorized. In particular, the question concerns the defendant's state of mind. To prove that a doctor's dispensation of drugs via prescription falls within the statute's prohibition and outside the authorization exception, is it sufficient for the Government to prove that a prescription was in fact not authorized, or must the Government prove that the doctor knew or intended that the prescription was unauthorized?",Breyer,0,
2021-046,41,"Petitioners Xiulu Ruan and Shakeel Kahn are both doctors who actively practiced medicine. They both possessed licenses permitting them to prescribe controlled substances.

2021-046,42,"At their separate trials, Ruan and Kahn argued that their dispensation of drugs was lawful because the drugs were dispensed pursuant to valid prescriptions. As noted above, a regulation provides that, to be effective, a prescription must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice. 21 C.F.R. § 1306.04(a). We assume, as did the courts below and the parties here, that a prescription is authorized and therefore lawful if it satisfies this standard. At Ruan's and Kahn's trials, the Government argued that the doctors' prescriptions failed to comply with this standard. The doctors argued that their prescriptions did comply, and that, even if not, the doctors did not knowingly deviate or intentionally deviate from the standard.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,43,"Ruan, for example, asked for a jury instruction that would have required the Government to prove that he subjectively knew that his prescriptions fell outside the scope of his prescribing authority. The District Court, however, rejected this request. The court instead set forth a more objective standard, instructing the jury that a doctor acts lawfully when he prescribes in good faith as part of his medical treatment of a patient in accordance with the standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the United States. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 20-410, p. 139a. The court further instructed the jury that a doctor violates § 841 when the doctor's actions were either not for a legitimate medical purpose or were outside the usual course of professional medical practice.

The court added that to find good faith, the jury must conclude that Kahn acted in an honest effort to prescribe for patients' medical conditions in accordance with generally recognized and accepted standards of practice.

2021-046,47,Both Ruan and Kahn filed petitions for certiorari. We granted the petitions and consolidated the cases to consider what mens rea applies to § 841's authorization exception.,Breyer,0,
2021-046,49,"As we have said, § 841 makes it unlawful, except as authorized,  for any person knowingly or intentionally  to manufacture, distribute, or dispense  a controlled substance. We now hold that § 841's knowingly or intentionally mens rea applies to the except as authorized clause. This means that once a defendant meets the burden of producing evidence that his or her conduct was authorized, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly or intentionally acted in an unauthorized manner. Our conclusion rests upon several considerations.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,51,"First, as a general matter, our criminal law seeks to punish the `vicious will.' Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), see also id., at 250, n. 4, 72 S.Ct. 240 (quoting F. Sayre, Cases on Criminal Law, p. xxxvi (R. Pound ed. 1927)). With few exceptions, `wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal.' Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. 723, 734, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015) (quoting Morissette, 342 U.S. at 252, 72 S.Ct. 240). Indeed, we have said that consciousness of wrongdoing is a principle as universal and persistent in mature systems of criminal law as belief in freedom of the human will and a  consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil. Id., at 250, 72 S.Ct. 240.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,52,"Consequently, when we interpret criminal statutes, we normally start from a longstanding presumption, traceable to the common law, that Congress intends to require a defendant to possess a culpable mental state. Rehaif v. United States, 588 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2191, 2195, 204 L.Ed.2d 594 (2019). We have referred to this culpable mental state as scienter, which means the degree of knowledge necessary to make a person criminally responsible for his or her acts. See ibid., Black's Law Dictionary 1613 (11th ed. 2019), Morissette, 342 U.S. at 250-252, 72 S.Ct. 240.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,53,"Applying the presumption of scienter, we have read into criminal statutes that are silent on the required mental state— meaning statutes that contain no mens rea provision whatsoever—`that mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from otherwise innocent conduct.' Elonis, 575 U.S. at 736, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (quoting Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 269, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000), emphasis added). Unsurprisingly, given the meaning of scienter, the mens rea we have read into such statutes is often that of knowledge or intent. See, e.g., Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 619, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994), United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 444-446, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978).",Breyer,0,
2021-046,54,"And when a statute is not silent as to mens rea but instead includes a general scienter provision, the presumption applies with equal or greater force to the scope of that provision. Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2195 (emphasis added). We have accordingly held that a word such as knowingly modifies not only the words directly following it, but also those other statutory terms that separate wrongful from innocent acts. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2197, see, e.g., ibid., United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 72, 115 S.Ct. 464 (1994), Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 426, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985).",Breyer,0,
2021-046,55,"Section 841 contains a general scienter provision—knowingly or intentionally. And in § 841 prosecutions, a lack of authorization is often what separates wrongfulness from innocence. Defendants who produce evidence that they are authorized to dispense controlled substances are often doctors dispensing drugs via prescription. We normally would not view such dispensations as inherently illegitimate, we expect, and indeed usually want, doctors to prescribe the medications that their patients need. In § 841 prosecutions, then, it is the fact that the doctor issued an unauthorized prescription that renders his or her conduct wrongful, not the fact of the dispensation itself. In other words, authorization plays a crucial role in separating innocent conduct—and, in the case of doctors, socially beneficial conduct—from wrongful conduct. X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at 73, 115 S.Ct. 464. Applying § 841's knowingly or intentionally mens rea to the authorization clause thus helps advance the purpose of scienter, for it helps to separate wrongful from innocent acts. Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2197, see also X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at 72-73, 115 S.Ct. 464.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,56,"In addition, the regulatory language defining an authorized prescription is, we have said, ambiguous, written in generalities, susceptible to more precise definition and open to varying constructions. Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 258, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006), see id., at 257, 126 S.Ct. 904 (regulation gives little or no instruction on major questions), see also 21 C.F.R. § 1306.04(a) (regulation defining effective prescription  as one issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice). The conduct prohibited by such language (issuing invalid prescriptions) is thus often difficult to distinguish from the gray zone of socially acceptable  conduct (issuing valid prescriptions). United States Gypsum, 438 U.S. at 441, 98 S.Ct. 2864. A strong scienter requirement helps to diminish the risk of overdeterrence, i.e., punishing acceptable and beneficial conduct that lies close to, but on the permissible side of, the criminal line. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,57,"The statutory provisions at issue here are also not the kind that we have held fall outside the scope of ordinary scienter requirements. Section 841 does not define a regulatory or public welfare offense that carries only minor penalties. Cf. Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct. at 2196-2197, Staples, 511 U.S. at 606, 114 S.Ct. 1793. Rather, § 841 imposes severe penalties upon those who violate it, including life imprisonment and fines up to $1 million. See § 841(b)(1)(C), see generally § 841(b). Such severe penalties counsel in favor of a strong scienter requirement. See Staples, 511 U.S. at 618-619, 114 S.Ct. 1793 (noting that a severe penalty is a further factor tending to suggest that  the usual presumption that a defendant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal should apply), United States Gypsum, 438 U.S. at 442, n. 18, 98 S.Ct. 2864.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,58,"Nor is the except as authorized clause a jurisdictional provision, to which the presumption of scienter would not apply. Cf. Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2195-2196, United States v. Yermian, 468 U.S. 63, 68-69, 104 S.Ct. 2936, 82 L.Ed.2d 53 (1984). To the contrary, and as we have explained, a lack of authorization is often the critical thing distinguishing wrongful from proper conduct.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,60,"Analogous precedent reinforces our conclusion. In Liparota, we interpreted a statute penalizing anyone who `knowingly uses food stamps in any manner not authorized by' statute. 471 U.S. at 420, 105 S.Ct. 2084. We held that knowingly modified both the use of food stamps element and the element that the use be not authorized. Id., at 423, 433, 105 S.Ct. 2084. We applied knowingly to the authorization language even though Congress had not explicitly and unambiguously indicated that it should so apply. Id., at 426, 105 S.Ct. 2084. But if knowingly did not modify the fact of nonauthorization, we explained, the statute would  criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct. Ibid.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,61,"Similarly, in X-Citement Video, we interpreted a statute penalizing anyone who `knowingly transports' or `knowingly receives' videos `involving the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.' 513 U.S. at 68, 115 S.Ct. 464. We held that knowingly applied not only to the element of transporting or receiving videos but also to the elemental fact that the videos involve the use of a minor. Id., at 66, 115 S.Ct. 464. We recognized that this was not the most grammatical reading of the statute. Id., at 70, 115 S.Ct. 464. But, we explained, the age of the performers is the crucial element separating legal innocence from wrongful conduct, for possessing sexually explicit videos involving nonminors is protected First Amendment activity. Id., at 72-73, 115 S.Ct. 464.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,62,"Finally, in Rehaif, we interpreted a statutory scheme in which one statutory subsection provided penalties for anyone who knowingly violates a separate subsection. 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2195-2196. This latter subsection made it unlawful for people with certain statuses  (i.e., being a felon or being in the country unlawfully) to possess a gun. Ibid. We held that the first subsection's knowingly language applied to the status element in the second subsection. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2196. To convict under the statute, then, the Government had to prove that a defendant knew he had one of the listed statuses. Ibid. Without knowledge of that status, we reasoned, the defendant may well lack the intent needed to make his behavior wrongful, because assuming compliance with ordinary licensing requirements, the possession of a gun can be entirely innocent. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2197.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,63,"Like the statutes at issue in these cases, the statute here contains a scienter provision. Section 841 states: Except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, or dispense  a controlled substance. (Emphasis added.) Like those three cases, the question here concerns the mental state that applies to a statutory clause (except as authorized) that does not immediately follow the scienter provision. Like the three cases, the statutory clause in question plays a critical role in separating a defendant's wrongful from innocent conduct. And, like the Court in those cases, we conclude that the statute's mens rea applies to that critical clause.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,65,"We are not convinced by the Government's arguments to the contrary. First, the Government correctly points out, and the concurrence emphasizes, that the statutory language at issue in the cases we have just described set forth elements of the offense. Here, the Government and the concurrence say, the except as authorized clause does not set forth an element. See, e.g., post, at 2384-2386 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).",Breyer,0,
2021-046,66,"The Government and the concurrence point to two ways in which the except as authorized clause is unlike an element, both of which rely on a different provision of the Controlled Substances Act—§ 885. Section 885 says that the Government need not negative—i.e., refute—any exemption or exception  in any complaint, information, indictment, or other pleading. This means that, in a prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act, the Government need not refer to a lack of authorization (or any other exemption or exception) in the criminal indictment. Cf. United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 108, 127 S.Ct. 782, 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007) (criminal indictment must set forth all elements of the charged crime). Section 885 also says that the Government need not negative any exemption or exception in any trial, and that the burden of going forward with the evidence with respect to any such exemption or exception shall be upon the person claiming its benefit, not upon the prosecution. Cf. Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977) (Government bears burden of proving all elements of charged offense).",Breyer,0,
2021-046,67,"But even assuming that lack of authorization is unlike an element for the two purposes that § 885 sets forth, those two purposes have little or nothing to do with scienter requirements. The first has to do with the indictment. It simply says that the Government need not set forth in an indictment a lack of authorization, or otherwise allege that a defendant does not fall within the many exceptions and exemptions that the Controlled Substances Act contains. The Act excepts, for example, licensed professionals such as dentists, veterinarians, scientific investigators, and pharmacists from the prohibition on dispensing  controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C. § 802(21). The Act also excepts employees of drug manufacturers, common carriers, and people with sick family members or pets from the prohibition on possessing controlled substances. See §§ 802(27), 822(c). Section 885 merely absolves the Government of having to allege, in an indictment, the inapplicability of every statutory exception in each Controlled Substances Act prosecution.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,68,"Section 885's second purpose refers only to the burden of going forward with the evidence, i.e., the burden of production. See Black's Law Dictionary, at 244. It says nothing regarding the distinct issue of the burden of persuasion—i.e., the burden of proving a lack of authorization. Cf. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 274, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994) (our opinions consistently distinguish between burden of proof, which we defined as burden of persuasion, and the burden of production or the burden of going forward with the evidence), see also Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 56, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005). Section 885 can thus be understood as providing a presumptive device, akin to others we have recognized in the criminal context, which merely shifts the burden of production to the defendant, following the satisfaction of which the ultimate burden of persuasion returns to the prosecution. County Court of Ulster Cty. v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 157-158, n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979), see Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 42, n. 1, 132 S.Ct. 2148, 183 L.Ed.2d 32 (2012) (per curiam). Contrary to the concurrence's assertion, see post, at 2387-2388, the differences between these two burdens and the use of procedural mechanisms to shift one burden but not the other are well established. See, e.g., 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 207, p. 246 (2019) (due process does not prohibit the use of a  procedural device that shifts to a defendant the burden of producing some evidence contesting a fact that may otherwise be inferred, provided the prosecution retains the ultimate burden of proof), 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 1.8(a), p. 102 (3d ed. 2018) (similar). In a § 841 prosecution, then, once the defendant satisfies the initial burden of production by producing evidence of authorization, the burden of proving a lack of authorization shifts back to the Government. And, as with § 885's indictment-related purpose, § 885's burden-related purpose simply relieves the Government from having to disprove, at the outset of every Controlled Substances Act prosecution, every exception in the statutory scheme.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,69,"Section 885 thus does not provide a basis for inferring that Congress intended to do away with, or weaken, ordinary and longstanding scienter requirements. At the same time, the language of § 841 (which explicitly includes a knowingly or intentionally provision), the crucial role authorization (or lack thereof) plays in distinguishing morally blameworthy conduct from socially necessary conduct, the serious nature of the crime and its penalties, and the vague, highly general language of the regulation defining the bounds of prescribing authority all support applying normal scienter principles to the except as authorized clause. That statutory requirement, while differing from an element in some respects, is sufficiently like an element in respect to the matter at issue here as to warrant similar legal treatment.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,70,"And the Government does not deny that, once a defendant claims that he or she falls within the authorization exception and the burden shifts back to the Government, the Government must prove a lack of authorization by satisfying the ordinary criminal law burden of proof—beyond a reasonable  doubt. See Brief for United States 26, Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-51, see also id., at 62-65. But see post, at 2387-2388 (concurrence suggesting, contrary to the position advanced by all parties to these cases, that the Government need only prove lack of authorization by a preponderance of the evidence). Once the defendant meets his or her burden of production, then, the Government must prove lack of authorization beyond a reasonable doubt.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,71,"Resisting the knowingly or intentionally standard, the Government instead offers a substitute mens rea standard. The Government says that rather than simply apply the statute's knowingly or intentionally language to the authorization clause, we should read the statute as implicitly containing an objectively reasonable good-faith effort or objective honest-effort standard. Brief for United States 16-17, cf. post, at 2389 (concurrence arguing that doctors can defend against a § 841 prosecution by proving that they have acted in subjective good faith in prescribing drugs). That is to say, once a defendant meets his or her burden of production, the Government can convict by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not even make an objectively reasonable attempt to ascertain and act within the bounds of professional medicine. Brief for United States 16.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,72,"We are not convinced. For one thing, § 841, like many criminal statutes, uses the familiar mens rea words knowingly or intentionally. It nowhere uses words such as good faith, objectively, reasonable, or honest effort.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,73,"For another, the Government's standard would turn a defendant's criminal liability on the mental state of a hypothetical reasonable doctor, not on the mental state of the defendant himself or herself. Cf. id., at 24 (Government arguing that a physician can violate Section 841(a) when he makes no objectively reasonable attempt to conform his conduct to something that his fellow doctors would view as medical care (emphasis added)).",Breyer,0,
2021-046,74,"We have rejected analogous suggestions in other criminal contexts. In Elonis, for example, we considered the mental state applicable to a statute that criminalized threatening communications but contained no explicit mens rea requirement. 575 U.S. at 732, 135 S.Ct. 2001. The Government argued that the statute required proof that a reasonable person would find the communications threatening. Id., at 738-739, 135 S.Ct. 2001. But, we said, having liability turn on whether a `reasonable person' regards the communication as a threat—regardless of what the defendant thinks—reduces culpability on the all-important element of the crime to negligence. Id., at 738, 135 S.Ct. 2001 (some internal quotation marks omitted). And, we emphasized, we `have long been reluctant to infer that a negligence standard was intended in criminal statutes.' Ibid. (quoting Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring)). We believe the same of the Government's proposed standard here.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,75,"The Government asserts that we held to the contrary, and effectively endorsed its honest-effort standard, in United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 96 S.Ct. 335, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975). Brief for United States 26. But the question in Moore was whether doctors could ever be held criminally liable under § 841. 423 U.S. at 124, 96 S.Ct. 335. Moore did not directly address the issue before us here regarding the mens rea required to convict under the statute.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,76,"Further, the Government, citing Yermian, notes that the authorization clause precedes the words knowingly or intentionally. And, the Government argues, grammatically speaking, that fact prevents the latter mens rea provision from modifying  the former clause. See Brief for United States 24-25. But Yermian based its holding on the fact that the clause preceding the mens rea provision set forth a jurisdictional criteria, which is typically not subject to a scienter requirement. 468 U.S. at 68-69, 104 S.Ct. 2936, see also Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2195-2196. Yermian did not base its holding on the grammatical positioning of the statutory language.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,77,"Finally, the Government argues that requiring it to prove that a doctor knowingly or intentionally acted not as authorized will allow bad-apple doctors to escape liability by claiming idiosyncratic views about their prescribing authority. See, e.g., Brief for United States 33. This kind of argument, however, can be made in many cases imposing scienter requirements, and we have often rejected it on bases similar to those we have set forth in Part II of this opinion. See, e.g., Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2198, Liparota, 471 U.S. at 433-434, 105 S.Ct. 2084.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,78,"We do the same here. The Government, of course, can prove knowledge of a lack of authorization through circumstantial evidence. See ibid. And the regulation defining the scope of a doctor's prescribing authority does so by reference to objective criteria such as legitimate medical purpose and usual course of professional practice. 21 C.F.R. § 1306.04(a), see Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 285, 126 S.Ct. 904 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (The use of the word `legitimate' connotes an objective standard of `medicine'), Moore, 423 U.S. at 141-142, 96 S.Ct. 335 (describing Congress' intent to confine authorized medical practice within accepted limits (emphasis added)). As we have said before, the more unreasonable a defendant's asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are, especially as measured against objective criteria, the more likely the jury  will find that the Government has carried its burden of proving knowledge. Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 203-204, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991). But the Government must still carry this burden. And for purposes of a criminal conviction under § 841, this requires proving that a defendant knew or intended that his or her conduct was unauthorized.",Breyer,0,
2021-046,80,"The Government argues that we should affirm Ruan's and Kahn's convictions because the jury instructions at their trials conveyed the requisite mens rea. Alternatively, the Government argues that any instructional error was harmless. But the Court of Appeals in both cases evaluated the jury instructions under an incorrect understanding of § 841's scienter requirements. We decline to decide in the first instance whether the instructions complied with the standard we have set forth today. Cf. Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2199-2200. We leave that and any harmlessness questions for the courts to address on remand.* * *",Breyer,0,
2021-046,81,"We conclude that § 841's knowingly or intentionally mens rea applies to the except as authorized clause. This means that in a § 841 prosecution in which a defendant meets his burden of production under § 885, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly or intentionally acted in an unauthorized manner.

2021-046,84,"In criminal law, the distinction between the elements of an offense and an affirmative  defense is well-known and important. In these cases, however, the Court recognizes a new hybrid that has some characteristics of an element and some characteristics of an affirmative defense. The consequences of this innovation are hard to foresee, but the result may well be confusion and disruption. That risk is entirely unnecessary.",Alito,0,
2021-046,85,"We granted certiorari in these cases to decide whether a physician may be convicted of dispensing or distributing drugs by prescription under a provision of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA), 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), if he or she believed in good faith that the prescription was within the course of professional practice. In my view, there is a straightforward answer to this question. The CSA contains an exception for prescriptions issued in the course of professional practice, and this exception is a carry-over from the CSA's predecessor, the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785. In interpreting the Harrison Act, this Court held that a registered physician acts in the course of his professional practice when the physician writes prescriptions in good faith. Linder v. United States, 268 U.S. 5, 17-18, 45 S.Ct. 446, 69 L.Ed. 819 (1925). I would hold that this rule applies under the CSA and would therefore vacate the judgments below and remand for further proceedings.",Alito,0,
2021-046,86,"The Court declines to adopt this approach and instead takes a radical new course. It holds that the mental state expressed by the terms knowingly or intentionally in § 841(a) applies to the provision's except as authorized proviso. It bases this conclusion not on anything in the language of the CSA, but instead on the presumption, traceable to the common law, that Congress intends to require a defendant to possess a culpable mental state. Rehaif v. United States, 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2191, 2195, 204 L.Ed.2d 594 (2019).",Alito,0,
2021-046,87,"The Court's analysis rests on an obvious conceptual mistake. A culpable mental state—or, to use the traditional Latin term, mens rea—is the mental state an accused must have in relation to the elements of an offense. But the authorizations in the CSA that excuse acts that are otherwise unlawful under § 841(a) are not elements of the offenses created by that provision. They are affirmative defenses. The presumption that elements must be accompanied by a culpable mental state—which I will call the mens rea canon—provides no guidance on what a defendant must prove to establish an affirmative defense. And for that reason, that canon does not help to decide whether there is a good-faith defense in § 841(a) prosecutions of physicians.",Alito,0,
2021-046,88,"The Court does not claim that the except as authorized proviso actually constitutes an element of dispensing or distributing a controlled substance. But it concludes, based on a vague four-part test, that the proviso is sufficiently like an element in respect to the matter at issue here as to warrant similar treatment. Ante, at 2380. How many other affirmative defenses might warrant similar treatment, the Court does not say. It leaves prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the lower courts in the dark. I cannot accept this cavalier treatment of an important question.",Alito,0,
2021-046,89,"Nor can I accept the Court's conclusion that once a defendant produces evidence that his or her conduct was authorized, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly or intentionally acted in an unauthorized manner. Ante, at 2376. We did not grant certiorari on the question of the burden of proof applicable to authorizations to dispense or distribute controlled  substances. No party has briefed this issue, and its resolution is not essential to our decision in these cases. In keeping with our normal practice, I would not address this question. But because the Court volunteers its own answer, I will offer one as well. As I see it, the text of the CSA does not show that Congress intended to deviate from the common-law rule that the burden of proving affirmative defenses— indeed, `all  circumstances of justification, excuse or alleviation'—rests on the defendant. Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 202, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone Commentaries *201). And absolutely nothing in the text of the statute indicates that Congress intended to impose a burden on the Government to disprove all assertions of authorization beyond a reasonable doubt.",Alito,0,
2021-046,92,"As relevant here, § 841(a)(1) provides that except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally  to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense,  a controlled substance. According to the Court's reasoning, the terms knowingly or intentionally in § 841(a)(1) apply to the except as authorized proviso at the beginning of the provision. But it is hard to see how this could be true.",Alito,0,
2021-046,93,"As a matter of elementary syntax, the adverbs knowingly and intentionally are most naturally understood to modify the verbs that follow, i.e., manufacture, distribute, etc., and not the introductory phrase except as authorized. That phrase, in turn, clearly modifies the term unlawful.",Alito,0,
2021-046,94,"The Court does not suggest otherwise. It does not claim that knowingly or intentionally modifies the introductory proviso in a grammatical sense. (If it did, the introductory phrase would clearly be an element, and for reasons that I will explain, infra, at 2385-2386, 21 U.S.C. § 885 unmistakably rules that out.) Instead, the Court pointedly uses different terminology. It repeatedly says that the phrase knowingly or intentionally applies to the introductory phrase, ante, at 2375, 2376, 2377, 2378-2379, 2382 (emphasis added). And it reaches this conclusion based on grounds that have nothing to do with grammar or syntax.",Alito,0,
2021-046,95,"Specifically, the Court relies on a substantive canon of interpretation—the mens rea canon. Under this canon, the Court interprets criminal statutes to require a mens rea for each element of an offense even where `the most grammatical reading of the statute' does not support that interpretation. Rehaif, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2197 (quoting United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 70, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994)).*  But until today, this canon has been applied only to elements, and the except as authorized introductory phrase in § 841(a)(1) is plainly not an element.",Alito,0,
2021-046,96,"The definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute. Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 424, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985). See also Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 7, 126 S.Ct. 2437, 165 L.Ed.2d 299 (2006). But authorization to dispense or distribute a controlled substance lacks the most basic features of an element of an offense. For one thing, it is black-letter law that an indictment must allege the elements of the offense charged. Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). So if lack of authorization were an element, it would be necessary to allege that in every § 841(a)(1) indictment. But § 885 says that it is not necessary for the United States to negative any exemption or exception set forth in the relevant subchapter in any indictment. Beyond that, the prosecution bears the burden of producing evidence with respect to every element of a crime. Patterson, 432 U.S. at 215, 97 S.Ct. 2319. But § 885(a)(1) also provides that the burden of going forward with the evidence with respect to any such exemption or exception shall be upon the person claiming its benefit. It could hardly be more obvious that Congress did not cast the except as authorized introductory proviso as an element of distributing or dispensing a controlled substance.",Alito,0,
2021-046,97,"Instead, that proviso clearly creates an affirmative defense—that is, a justification or excuse which is a bar to the imposition of criminal liability on conduct that satisfies the elements of an offense. 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 1.8(c) (3d ed. 2018). Section 841(a)(1) has two main parts: a principal clause generally prohibiting knowingly or intentionally doing certain things with respect to controlled substances (i.e., manufacturing them, distributing them, etc.), and a proviso indicating that these acts are unlawful except as authorized by other statutory provisions. As we have long held, the default rule for interpreting provisions with this structure is that `an exception made by a proviso or other distinct clause' designates an affirmative defense that the Government has no duty to `negative.' Dixon, 548 U.S. at 13, 126 S.Ct. 2437 (quoting McKelvey v. United States, 260 U.S. 353, 357, 43 S.Ct. 132, 67 L.Ed. 301 (1922)), see also United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 165, 10 L.Ed. 689 (1841) (calling this the general rule of law which has always prevailed). When this rule applies, it is `incumbent on one who relies on such an exception to set it up and establish it.' Dixon, 548 U.S. at 13, 126 S.Ct. 2437 (quoting McKelvey, 260 U.S. at 357, 43 S.Ct. 132).",Alito,0,
2021-046,98,"The CSA explicitly incorporates this default rule. As noted, § 885(a)(1) provides that the prosecution need not negative any exemption or exception set forth in this subchapter in any complaint, information, indictment, or other pleading or in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding. (Emphasis added.) Short of using the words affirmative defense, there is no  clearer way of indicating that authorization constitutes an affirmative defense.",Alito,0,
2021-046,99,"On the most natural reading, then, § 841(a)(1) creates an offense that has as its elements (1) knowingly or intentionally (2) distributing or dispensing (3) a controlled substance. The except as authorized proviso recognizes an affirmative defense that excuses or justifies conduct that otherwise would fall within § 841(a)(1)'s general prohibition. The mens rea canon does not speak to the constituents of that defense.",Alito,0,
2021-046,101,"While the Court does not claim that the except as authorized proviso is an element of a § 841(a)(1) offense, the Court argues that the proviso is sufficiently like an element in respect to the matter at issue here for the mens rea canon to apply, ante, at 2380-2381. The Court provides four reasons for this conclusion: The language of § 841 (which explicitly includes a `knowingly or intentionally' provision), the crucial role authorization (or lack thereof) plays in distinguishing morally blameworthy conduct from socially necessary conduct, the serious nature of the crime and its penalties, and the vague, highly general language of the regulation defining the bounds of prescribing authority. Ibid. Not one of these reasons withstands scrutiny.",Alito,0,
2021-046,102,"The language of § 841. The Court notes that this provision expressly sets out a mens rea that applies to the elements of the offense, ante, at 2381, but the vast majority of criminal statutes share this characteristic. Therefore, this feature does not set § 841 apart.",Alito,0,
2021-046,103,"The crucial role authorization (or lack thereof) plays in distinguishing morally blameworthy conduct from socially necessary conduct. The Court claims that authorization separates out morally blameworthy innocent conduct, but something very similar may be said about most, if not all, affirmative defenses. Take the common-law defense of duress. Duress excuses criminal conduct where the actor was under an unlawful threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury and the threat caused the actor to engage in conduct violating the literal terms of the criminal law. United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 409, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). But a person who acts under duress is not morally blameworthy—that is part of what it means to say that duress excuses otherwise-criminal conduct. Similarly, individuals who kill or wound another person in self-defense to prevent their own death or serious injury are not considered morally blameworthy. No one supposes that these defenses are hybrids, or that the mens rea canon is a guide to their content.",Alito,0,
2021-046,104,"It is unclear why the Court thinks that § 841(a)'s affirmative defense is different. There are hints in the Court's opinion that it has crafted a special rule for doctors— for example, the Court describes their conduct in writing prescriptions as not just innocent, but socially beneficial and socially necessary. Ante, at 2377, 2380-2381. But § 841(a) is not a doctor-specific provision. Section 841(a)'s proviso presumably applies in the same way for all § 841(a) defendants—whether they are drug dealers accused of selling heroin or are physicians charged with abusing their authority to prescribe painkillers.",Alito,0,
2021-046,105,"The serious nature of the crime and its penalties. The Court also suggests that authorization is like an element because dispensing or distributing a controlled substance is a felony that carries a substantial sentence. But would all felonies qualify? If not, where would the Court draw the line? The Court provides no answers.",Alito,0,
2021-046,106,"The vague, highly general language of the regulation defining prescribing authority. As the Court explains, the regulation defining the authority of physicians to prescribe controlled substances allows them to issue a prescription for a legitimate medical purpose  in the usual course of  professional practice. 21 C.F.R. § 1306.04(a) (2021). But § 841(a) applies to many other types of violations and many other categories of defendants. Is the proviso a hybrid element/defense only for doctors? Would its status change if the regulation were reframed in more specific terms? How can the status of a phrase in a statute depend upon an implementing regulation? The Court provides no answer to these or any other questions naturally raised by its ipse dixit that the exception in § 841(a) is sufficiently like an element to require that it be treated as such in some respects but not others.",Alito,0,
2021-046,108,"The Court also errs in holding that, if a § 841(a)(1) defendant meets the burden of producing evidence that his or her conduct was `authorized,' the Government has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly or intentionally acted in an unauthorized manner, ante, at 2376. As noted, the common-law rule was that the defendant had the burden of production and persuasion on any affirmative defense. And the Court has held that when Congress does not address the burden of proof in the text of a statute, we presume that Congress intended to preserve the common-law rule. Smith v. United States, 568 U.S. 106, 112, 133 S.Ct. 714, 184 L.Ed.2d 570 (2013), see also Dixon, 548 U.S. at 13-14, 126 S.Ct. 2437.",Alito,0,
2021-046,109,"The Court identifies one and only one reason for deviating from this background rule—the fact that § 885(a)(1) states that the burden of going forward with the evidence with respect to any  exemption or exception shall be upon the person claiming its benefit. Because this provision does not say expressly that a defendant also has the burden of persuasion, the Court infers that Congress meant to allocate that burden to the prosecution. That inference is unwarranted. Section 885(a)(1) explicitly relieves the Government of the burden of negativing exceptions in any trial. And it is hard to see how the Government does not have the burden to negative exceptions if it must affirmatively disprove a prima facie case of authorization any time a defendant satisfies the initial burden of production.",Alito,0,
2021-046,110,"But even if one credits the majority's assumption that the CSA partly deviates from the common-law rule by shifting the burden of persuasion to the Government, the majority's further holding that the Government must carry that burden with proof beyond a reasonable doubt comes out of thin air. The usual rule is that affirmative defenses must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. Id., at 17, 126 S.Ct. 2437. But the majority does not identify a single word in §§ 841(a)(1), 885(a)(1), or any other provision of the CSA that even suggests that the statute imposes a burden of disproving authorization defenses beyond a reasonable doubt.",Alito,0,
2021-046,111,"The only thing that could conceivably justify reading a reasonable-doubt requirement into a statute that says nothing on the subject is the principle that an ambiguous statute must be interpreted, when possible, to avoid unconstitutionality. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 247-251 (2012). But the Court does not claim that it would be unconstitutional for Congress to require the Government to prove lack of authorization by only a preponderance of the evidence. Indeed, the Court does not  even claim that it would be unconstitutional to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant. Nor could it. Our precedents establish that governments are foreclosed from shifting the burden of proof to the defendant only `when an affirmative defense negates an element of the crime.' Smith, 568 U.S. at 110, 133 S.Ct. 714 (quoting Martin v. Ohio, 480 U.S. 228, 237, 107 S.Ct. 1098, 94 L.Ed.2d 267 (1987) (Powell, J., dissenting)). And we have held that when an affirmative defense instead justifies or `excuses conduct that would otherwise be punishable,' the Government has no constitutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. 568 U.S. at 110, 133 S.Ct. 714 (quoting Dixon, 548 U.S. at 6, 126 S.Ct. 2437).",Alito,0,
2021-046,112,"The authorization defense made available to prescribing physicians by the CSA plainly does not negate any of the defining elements of dispensing or distributing a controlled substance in violation of § 841(a)(1). As a result, the Court has no basis for reading a requirement to disprove authorization into the CSA. And at a minimum, even if the Government must bear the ultimate burden of persuasion once the burden of production is satisfied, the CSA should be read to preserve a traditional preponderance-of-the-evidence standard for authorization defenses.",Alito,0,
2021-046,114,"My analysis thus far establishes that authorization is an affirmative defense to liability under § 841(a)(1), and the constituents of that defense cannot be identified through brute-force application of a canon designed to identify the elements of an offense. In my view, the contours of that defense can be elucidated only by examining the text, structure, and history of the provisions of the CSA that define it. I turn to that task now.",Alito,0,
2021-046,115,"The authorization relied on by the petitioners in these cases permits physicians registered with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe controlled substances to patients by prescription. §§ 822(b), 823(f), 829(a). As we have previously interpreted it, this authorization does not allow physicians to dispense controlled substances by prescription for any reason they choose, instead, the authorization is limited to the dispensing and use of drugs `in the course of professional practice or research.' United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 141, 96 S.Ct. 335, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975) (quoting § 802(20) (1970 ed.)).",Alito,0,
2021-046,116,"The notion of action taken in the course of professional practice is not defined in the CSA, but our precedents hold that when Congress employs a term of art obviously transplanted from another legal source, it brings the old soil with it. George v. McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 119 S.Ct. 1953, ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (quoting Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1795, 1801, ___, 204 L.Ed.2d 129 (2019), internal quotation marks omitted). And the notion that a prescription is authorized if it is issued in the course of professional practice is directly traceable to the Harrison Act, which prohibited any person from distributing or dispensing coca leaves or opium except in pursuance of a written order issued by a practitioner in the course of his professional practice only. § 2, 38 Stat. 786. Arguably, the phrase in the course of  professional practice could have been read to refer only to conduct that conforms to the standards of medical practice as a purely objective matter. But our Harrison Act precedents interpreted that phrase to refer to bona fide medical practice, which meant that any prescription issued in good faith qualified as an authorized act of dispensing one of the drugs proscribed by the statute. Linder, 268 U.S. at  17-18, 45 S.Ct. 446, see also Boyd v. United States, 271 U.S. 104, 107, 46 S.Ct. 442, 70 L.Ed. 857 (1926), Webb v.

2021-046,117,"Nothing in the CSA suggests that Congress intended to depart from the preexisting understanding of action in the course of professional practice. We have previously held that the CSA incorporates settled understandings of the exemption given to doctors to dispense controlled substances `in the course of  professional practice' under the Harrison Act. Moore, 423 U.S. at 139-140, 96 S.Ct. 335 (quoting 38 Stat. 786). And the language of the CSA supports the same conclusions that we previously reached about the Harrison Act. As our CSA precedents have explained, to act in the course of professional practice is to engage in the practice of medicine—or, as we have put it, to act `as a physician.' Moore, 423 U.S. at 141, 96 S.Ct. 335. For a practitioner to practice medicine, he or she must act for a medical purpose—which means aiming to prevent, cure, or alleviate the symptoms of a disease or injury—and must believe that the treatment is a medically legitimate means of treating the relevant disease or injury.",Alito,0,
2021-046,118,"But acting as a physician does not invariably mean acting as a good physician, as an objective understanding of the in the course of professional practice standard would suggest. A doctor who makes negligent or even reckless mistakes in prescribing drugs is still acting as a doctor —he or she is simply acting as a bad doctor. The same cannot be said, however, when a doctor knowingly or purposefully issues a prescription to facilitate addiction and recreational abuse, Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 274, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006). Objectives of that kind are alien to medical practice, and a doctor who prescribes drugs for those purposes is not acting as a physician in any meaningful sense.",Alito,0,
2021-046,119,"I would thus hold that a doctor who acts in subjective good faith in prescribing drugs is entitled to invoke the CSA's authorization defense. Under the correct understanding of that defense, a doctor acts in the course of professional practice in issuing a prescription under the CSA if— but only if—he or she believes in good faith that the prescription is a valid means of pursuing a medical purpose. A doctor who knows that he or she is acting for a purpose foreign to medicine—such as facilitating addiction or recreational drug abuse—is not protected by the CSA's authorization to distribute controlled substances by prescription. Such doctors may be convicted of unlawfully distributing or dispensing a controlled substance under § 841(a)(1).",Alito,0,

In 1980 and 1981, in part due to rising Medicare costs, Congress enacted and amended  the Medicare Secondary Payer statute. That statute as amended makes Medicare a secondary payer to an individual's existing insurance plan for certain medical services, including dialysis, when that plan already covers the same services.

First, a plan may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals having end stage renal disease and other individuals covered by such plan on the basis of the existence of end stage renal disease, the need for renal dialysis, or in any other manner. § 1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii).

2021-047,45,"The Marietta Plan provides the same benefits, including the same outpatient dialysis benefits, to individuals with and without end-stage renal disease. Indeed, DaVita does not dispute that the Plan's terms apply uniformly to all Plan participants.

2021-047,46,"In response, DaVita primarily argues that the statute authorizes liability even when a plan limits benefits in a uniform way if the limitation on benefits has a disparate impact on individuals with end-stage renal disease.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-047,47,"To begin with, the text of the statute cannot be read to encompass a disparate-impact theory. That text requires inquiry into whether a plan provides different benefits to (i) those with end-stage renal disease and (ii) those without end-stage renal disease. The text does not ask about the effects of non-differentiating plan terms that treat all individuals equally. 978 F.3d, at 363 (opinion of Murphy, J.), see also Amy's Kitchen, 981 F.3d, at 674-675. In light of that plain text, it comes as no surprise that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have never adopted a disparate-impact theory in their longstanding regulations implementing this statute.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-047,48,"The disparate-impact theory not only is atextual but also would be all but impossible to fairly implement. The premise of the disparate-impact theory is that the plan's benefits for outpatient dialysis are inadequate. But what level of benefits would be adequate, and how would courts determine the level of benefits that qualifies as adequate?",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-047,49,Neither the statute nor DaVita offers a basis for determining when coverage for outpatient dialysis could be considered inadequate. And neither the statute nor DaVita supplies an objective benchmark or comparator against which to measure a plan's coverage for outpatient dialysis.,Kavanaugh,0,
2021-047,50,"Absent some benchmark or comparator, courts would have great difficulty trying to make an apples-to-apples comparison of a plan's coverage for outpatient dialysis against its coverage for other services. Group health plans cover services for many different health issues at varied rates. Those rates may reflect negotiations with third parties, the needs of a particular plan's beneficiaries, and other factors such as geography. Courts would be entirely at sea in trying to determine an appropriate benchmark or comparator for outpatient dialysis. Put simply, DaVita's approach is a prescription for judicial and administrative chaos, and further demonstrates that DaVita's disparate-impact theory is not a correct interpretation of the statute.2",Kavanaugh,0,

As the Government itself acknowledges, the statute does not dictate any particular level of dialysis coverage by a group health plan. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13. If Congress wanted to mandate that group health plans provide particular benefits, or to require that group health plans ensure parity between different kinds of benefits, Congress knew how to write such a law. It did not do so in this statute. To the extent that Congress wants to create such a system going forward, Congress of course may do so.",Kavanaugh,0,

The majority holds that the plan here does not so differentiate because it draws distinctions only between dialysis and other treatments —not between individuals with end stage renal disease and individuals without it. See ante, at 1974, n. 2. That conclusion flies in the face of both common sense and the statutory text.*",Kagan,0,
2021-047,60,"One fact is key to understanding this case: Outpatient dialysis is an almost perfect proxy for end stage renal disease. Virtually everyone with end stage renal disease—and hardly anyone else—undergoes outpatient dialysis. Ninety-seven percent of people diagnosed with end stage renal disease—all those who do not obtain a preemptive kidney transplant—undergo dialysis. See National Institutes of Health, United States Renal Data System, 2021 Ann. Data Rep.: End Stage Renal Disease, ch. 1, figure 1.2, https://adr.usrds.org/2021/end-stage-renal-disease. And 99.5% of DaVita's outpatient dialysis patients have or develop end stage renal disease. See Brief for Respondents 6.",Kagan,0,
2021-047,61,"Because that is so, common sense suggests that we should not care whether a health plan differentiates in benefits by targeting people with end stage renal disease, or instead by targeting the use of dialysis. When status and conduct are proxies for each other, our decisions have declined to distinguish between them. Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 689, 130 S.Ct. 2971, 177 L.Ed.2d 838 (2010). So, for example, we have explained that a penalty for homosexual conduct is a penalty for homosexual persons. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 575, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003). And likewise, a tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews. Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993). The same goes here: A reimbursement limit for outpatient dialysis is in reality a reimbursement limit for people  with end stage renal disease. And so a plan singling out dialysis for disfavored coverage differentiates in the benefits it provides between individuals having end stage renal disease and other individuals. § 1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii). That is so even if, as petitioner Marietta notes, dialysis is also a treatment for some miniscule number of people with acute kidney injury. See Reply Brief 13. That a proxy is only 99.5% (not 100%) accurate should make no difference. A tax on yarmulkes remains a tax on Jews, even if friends of other faiths might occasionally don one at a Bar Mitzvah.",Kagan,0,
2021-047,62,"And if common sense were not enough, statutory text would come to the rescue. Congress was well aware of the relationship between end stage renal disease and dialysis—and the text it wrote reflects that knowledge. The statute proscribes not just differentiation on the basis of the existence of end stage renal disease, but also on the basis of  the need for renal dialysis, or in any other manner. § 1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii). The back half of that provision prevents exactly the circumvention the majority today allows. It bars plans from differentiating between people with and without end stage renal disease even when that differentiation is accomplished indirectly—by targeting their treatment, or by relying on some other proxy for the condition. So contra the majority, the statutory text does indeed prohibit differentiation as to services—and not only as to individuals. See ante, at 1974, n. 2.",Kagan,0,
2021-047,63,"That reading also fits with the statute's purpose. As the majority recognizes, the MSPA's renal disease provisions were designed to prevent plans from foisting the cost of dialysis onto Medicare. See ante, at 1971-1972. Yet the Court now tells plans they can do just that, so long as they target dialysis, rather than the patients who rely on it, for disfavored coverage. Congress would not—and did not—craft a statute permitting such a maneuver. Now Congress will have to fix a statute this Court has broken. I respectfully dissent.",Kagan,0,

Bivens, 403 U.S. at 407, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment), see also post, at 1809-1810 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment). Those factors include economic and governmental concerns, administrative costs, and the impact on governmental operations systemwide. Ziglar, 582 U. S.,  at ___, ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858. Unsurprisingly, Congress is far more competent than the Judiciary to weigh such policy considerations. Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 423, 108 S.Ct. 2460. And the Judiciary's authority to do so at all is, at best, uncertain. See, e.g., Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,43,"Nonetheless, rather than dispense with Bivens altogether, we have emphasized that recognizing a cause of action under Bivens is a disfavored judicial activity. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1856-1857 (internal quotation marks omitted), Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742-743 (internal quotation marks omitted). When asked to imply a Bivens action, our watchword is caution. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742. If there are sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy, the courts must refrain from creating it. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858. Even a single sound reason to defer to Congress is enough to require a court to refrain from creating such a remedy. Nestlé USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1931, 210 L.Ed.2d 207 (2021) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 6). Put another way, the most important question is who should decide whether to provide for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts? Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 750 (internal quotation marks omitted). If there is a rational reason to think that the answer is Congress—as it will be in most every case, see Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1857-1858—no Bivens action may lie. Our cases instruct that, absent utmost deference to Congress' preeminent authority in this area, the courts arrogate legislative power. Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 741-742.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,44,"To inform a court's analysis of a proposed Bivens claim, our cases have framed the inquiry as proceeding in two steps. See Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742-743. First, we ask whether the case presents a new Bivens context —i.e., is it meaningfully different from the three cases in which the Court has implied a damages action. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1859-1860. Second, if a claim arises in a new context, a Bivens remedy is unavailable if there are special factors indicating that the Judiciary is at least arguably less equipped than Congress to weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858 (internal quotation marks omitted). If there is even a single reason to pause before applying Bivens in a new context, a court may not recognize a Bivens remedy. Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 743.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,45,"While our cases describe two steps, those steps often resolve to a single question: whether there is any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy. For example, we have explained that a new context arises when there are potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1860. And we have identified several examples of new contexts —e.g., a case that involves a new category of defendants, Malesko, 534 U.S. at 68, 122 S.Ct. 515, see also Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1856-1857—largely because they represent situations in which a court is not undoubtedly better positioned than Congress to create a damages action. We have never offered an exhaustive accounting of such scenarios, however, because no court could forecast every factor that might counsel hesitation. Id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1880. Even in a particular case, a court likely cannot predict the systemwide consequences of recognizing a cause of action under Bivens. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___,  137 S.Ct., at 1858. That uncertainty alone is a special factor that forecloses relief. See Hernández v. Mesa, 885 F.3d 811, 818 (C.A.5 2018) (en banc) (The newness of this `new context' should alone require dismissal).",Thomas,0,
2021-048,46,"Finally, our cases hold that a court may not fashion a Bivens remedy if Congress already has provided, or has authorized the Executive to provide, an alternative remedial structure. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858, see also Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 425, 108 S.Ct. 2460. If there are alternative remedial structures in place, that alone, like any special factor, is reason enough to limit the power of the Judiciary to infer a new Bivens cause of action. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858.2 Importantly, the relevant question is not whether a Bivens action would disrupt a remedial scheme, Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 426, 108 S.Ct. 2460, or whether the court should provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed, Bush, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S.Ct. 2404. Nor does it matter that existing remedies do not provide complete relief. Ibid. Rather, the court must ask only whether it, rather than the political branches, is better equipped to decide whether existing remedies should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy. Ibid, see also id., at 380, 103 S.Ct. 2404 (the question is who should decide).",Thomas,0,
2021-048,48,"Applying the foregoing principles, the Court of Appeals plainly erred when it created causes of action for Boule's Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim and First Amendment retaliation claim.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,50,"The Court of Appeals conceded that Boule's Fourth Amendment claim presented a new context for Bivens purposes, yet it concluded there was no reason to hesitate before recognizing a cause of action against Agent Egbert. See 998 F.3d at 387. That conclusion was incorrect for two independent reasons: Congress is better positioned to create remedies in the border-security context, and the Government already has provided alternative remedies that protect plaintiffs like Boule. We address each in turn.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,52,"In Hernández, we declined to create a damages remedy for an excessive-force claim against a Border Patrol agent who shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican national across the border in Mexico. See 589 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 739-740. We did not recognize a Bivens action there because regulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestionably has national security implications, and the risk of undermining border security provides reason to hesitate before extending Bivens into this field. Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 747. This reasoning applies here with full force. During the alleged altercation with Boule, Agent Egbert was carrying out Border Patrol's mandate to interdict persons attempting to illegally enter or exit the United States or goods being illegally imported into or exported from the United States. 6 U.S.C. § 211(e)(3)(A). Because matters intimately  related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention, Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292, 101 S.Ct. 2766, 69 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981), we reaffirm that a Bivens cause of action may not lie where, as here, national security is at issue.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,53,"The Court of Appeals thought otherwise. In its view, Boule's Fourth Amendment claim is conventional, 998 F.3d at 387, see also post, at 1814-1815, 1816-1817 (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (same), and, though it arises in a new context, this Court has not `cast doubt' on extending Bivens within the `common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement' in which it arose, 998 F.3d at 389 (quoting Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1857). While Bivens and this case do involve similar allegations of excessive force and thus arguably present almost parallel circumstances or a similar mechanism of injury, Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1859, these superficial similarities are not enough to support the judicial creation of a cause of action. The special-factors inquiry —which Bivens never meaningfully undertook, see Stanley, 483 U.S. at 678, 107 S.Ct. 3054—shows here, no less than in Hernández, that the Judiciary is not undoubtedly better positioned than Congress to authorize a damages action in this national-security context. That this case does not involve a cross-border shooting, as in Hernández, but rather a more conventional excessive-force claim, as in Bivens, does not bear on the relevant point. Either way, the Judiciary is comparatively ill suited to decide whether a damages remedy against any Border Patrol agent is appropriate.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,54,"The Court of Appeals downplayed the national-security risk from imposing Bivens liability because Agent Egbert was not literally `at the border,' and Boule's guest already had cleared customs in New York. 998 F.3d at 388, see also post, at 1816-1817, 1820 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (same). The court also found that Boule had a weightier interest in Bivens relief than the parents of the deceased Mexican teenager in Hernández, because Boule is a United States citizen, complaining of harm suffered on his own property in the United States. 998 F.3d at 388, see also post, at 1816-1817, 1820 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (same). Finding that any costs imposed by allowing a Bivens claim to proceed are outweighed by compelling interests in favor of protecting United States citizens on their own property in the United States, the court extended Bivens to Boule's case. 998 F.3d at 389.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,55,"This analysis is deeply flawed. The Bivens inquiry does not invite federal courts to independently assess the costs and benefits of implying a cause of action. A court faces only one question: whether there is any rational reason (even one) to think that Congress is better suited to weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858. Thus, a court should not inquire, as the Court of Appeals did here, whether Bivens relief is appropriate in light of the balance of circumstances in the particular case. Stanley, 483 U.S. at 683, 107 S.Ct. 3054. A court inevitably will impair governmental interests, and thereby frustrate Congress' policymaking role, if it applies the `special factors' analysis at such a narrow level of generality. Id., at 681, 107 S.Ct. 3054. Rather, under the proper approach, a court must ask more broadly if there is any reason to think that judicial intrusion into a given field might be harmful or inappropriate. Ibid. If so, or even if there is the potential for such consequences, a court cannot afford a plaintiff a Bivens remedy. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1859-1860,  1864-1865 (emphasis added). As in Hernández, then, we ask here whether a court is competent to authorize a damages action not just against Agent Egbert but against Border Patrol agents generally. The answer, plainly, is no. See Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 746-747 (refusing to extend Bivens into the field of border security).",Thomas,0,
2021-048,56,"The Court of Appeals' analysis betrays the pitfalls of applying the special-factors analysis at too granular a level. The court rested on three irrelevant distinctions from Hernández. First, Agent Egbert was several feet from (rather than straddling) the border, but cross-border security is obviously implicated in either event. Second, Boule's guest arrived in Seattle from New York rather than abroad, but an alien's port of entry does not make him less likely to be a national-security threat. And third, Agent Egbert investigated immigration violations on our side of the border, not Canada's, but immigration investigations in this country are perhaps more likely to impact the national security of the United States. In short, the Court of Appeals offered no plausible basis to permit a Fourth Amendment Bivens claim against Agent Egbert to proceed.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,58,"Second, Congress has provided alternative remedies for aggrieved parties in Boule's position that independently foreclose a Bivens action here. In Hernández, we declined to authorize a Bivens remedy, in part, because the Executive Branch already had investigated alleged misconduct by the defendant Border Patrol agent. See 589 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 744-745, 746-747. In Malesko, we explained that Bivens relief was unavailable because federal prisoners could, among other options, file grievances through an Administrative Remedy Program. 534 U.S. at 74, 122 S.Ct. 515. Both kinds of remedies are available here. The U. S. Border Patrol is statutorily obligated to control, direct, and supervise  all employees. 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(2). And, by regulation, Border Patrol must investigate alleged violations of the standards for enforcement activities and accept grievances from any persons wishing to lodge a complaint. 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.10(a)-(b). As noted, Boule took advantage of this grievance procedure, prompting a year-long internal investigation into Agent Egbert's conduct. See supra, at 1801-1802.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,59,"Boule nonetheless contends that Border Patrol's grievance process is inadequate because he is not entitled to participate and has no right to judicial review of an adverse determination.3 But we have never held that a Bivens alternative must afford rights to participation or appeal. That is so because Bivens is concerned solely with deterring the unconstitutional acts of individual officers—i.e., the focus is whether the Government has put in place safeguards to prevent constitutional violations from recurring. Malesko, 534 U.S. at 71, 74, 122 S.Ct. 515, see  also Meyer, 510 U.S. at 485, 114 S.Ct. 996. And, again, the question whether a given remedy is adequate is a legislative determination that must be left to Congress, not the federal courts. So long as Congress or the Executive has created a remedial process that it finds sufficient to secure an adequate level of deterrence, the courts cannot second-guess that calibration by superimposing a Bivens remedy. That is true even if a court independently concludes that the Government's procedures are not as effective as an individual damages remedy. Bush, 462 U.S. at 372, 103 S.Ct. 2404. Thus here, as in Hernández, we have no warrant to doubt that the consideration of Boule's grievance against Agent Egbert secured adequate deterrence and afforded Boule an alternative remedy. See 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 744-745.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,61,"We also conclude that there is no Bivens cause of action for Boule's First Amendment retaliation claim. While we have assumed that such a damages action might be available, see, e.g., Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 252, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006), we have never held that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims, Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 663, n. 4, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012). Because a new context arises when there is a new constitutional right at issue, Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1860, the Court of Appeals correctly held that Boule's First Amendment claim presents a new Bivens context. See 998 F.3d at 390. Now presented with the question whether to extend Bivens to this context, we hold that there is no Bivens action for First Amendment retaliation. There are many reasons to think that Congress, not the courts, is better suited to authorize such a damages remedy.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,62,"Recognizing any new Bivens action entails substantial social costs, including the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Extending Bivens to alleged First Amendment violations would pose an acute risk of increasing such costs. A plaintiff can turn practically any adverse action into grounds for a retaliation claim. And, because an official's state of mind is easy to allege and hard to disprove, insubstantial claims that turn on retaliatory intent may be less amenable to summary disposition. Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 584-585, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even a frivolous retaliation claim threatens to set off broad-ranging discovery in which there is often no clear end to the relevant evidence. Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1715, 204 L.Ed.2d 1 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-048,63,"Undoubtedly, then, the prospect of personal liability under the First Amendment would lead to new difficulties and expense. Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 425, 108 S.Ct. 2460. Federal employees faced with the added risk of personal liability for decisions that they believe to be a correct response to improper activity would be deterred from carrying out their duties. Bush, 462 U.S. at 389, 103 S.Ct. 2404. We are therefore convinced that, in light of these costs, Congress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by imposing a damages action. Id., at 390, 103 S.Ct. 2404.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,64,"The Court of Appeals nonetheless extended Bivens to the First Amendment because, in its view, retaliation claims are well-established, and Boule alleges that  Agent Egbert was not carrying out official duties when he retaliated against him. 998 F.3d at 391. Neither rationale has merit. First, just because plaintiffs often plead unlawful retaliation to establish a First Amendment violation is not a reason to afford them a cause of action to sue federal officers for money damages. If anything, that retaliation claims are common, and therefore more likely to impose a significant expansion of Government liability, Meyer, 510 U.S. at 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, counsels against permitting Bivens relief.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,65,"Second, the Court of Appeals' scope-of-duty observation does not meaningfully limit the number of potential Bivens claims or otherwise undermine the reasons for hesitation stated above. It is easy to allege that federal employees acted beyond the scope of their authority when claiming a constitutional violation. And, regardless, granting Bivens relief because a federal agent supposedly did not act pursuant to his law-enforcement mission misses the point. Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 746-747. The question is not whether national security, or some other governmental interest, actually requires the defendant's conduct. Ibid. Instead, we ask whether the Judiciary should alter the framework established by the political branches for addressing any such conduct that allegedly violates the Constitution. Ibid. With respect to that question, the foregoing discussion shows that the Judiciary is ill equipped to alter that framework generally, and especially so when it comes to First Amendment claims.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,66,"Boule responds that any hesitation is unwarranted because this Court in Passman already identified a Bivens cause of action under allegedly similar circumstances. There, the Court permitted a congressional staffer to sue a congressman for sex discrimination under the Fifth Amendment. See 442 U.S. at 231, 99 S.Ct. 2264. In Boule's view, Passman, like this case, permitted a damages action to proceed even though it required the factfinder to probe a federal official's motives for taking an adverse action against the plaintiff.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,67,"Even assuming the factual parallels are as close as Boule claims, Passman carries little weight because it predates our current approach to implied causes of action and diverges from the prevailing framework in three important ways. First, the Passman Court concluded that a Bivens action must be available if there is no effective means other than the judiciary to vindicate the purported Fifth Amendment right. 442 U.S. at 243, 99 S.Ct. 2264, see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 18-19, 100 S.Ct. 1468 (Congress can foreclose Bivens relief by providing an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective). Since then, however, we have explained that the absence of relief does not by any means necessarily imply that courts should award money damages. Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 421, 108 S.Ct. 2460. Second, Passman indicated that a damages remedy is appropriate unless Congress explicitly declares that a claimant may not recover money damages. 442 U.S. at 246-247, 99 S.Ct. 2264 (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis deleted). Now, though, we defer to congressional inaction if the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms. Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 423, 108 S.Ct. 2460, see also Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858. Third, when assessing the special factors, Passman asked whether a court is competent to calculate damages without difficult questions of valuation or causation. 442 U.S. at 245, 99 S.Ct. 2264. But today, we do not ask whether a court can determine a damages  amount. Rather, we ask whether there are sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy at all. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,68,"In short, as we explained in Ziglar, a plaintiff cannot justify a Bivens extension based on parallel circumstances with Bivens, Passman, or Carlson unless he also satisfies the analytic framework prescribed by the last four decades of intervening case law. 582 U. S., at ___ - ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1859-1860. Boule has failed to do so.",Thomas,0,
2021-048,70,"Since it was decided, Bivens has had no shortage of detractors. See, e.g., Bivens, 403 U.S. at 411, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), id., at 427, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (Black, J., dissenting), id., at 430, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), Carlson, 446 U.S. at 31, 100 S.Ct. 1468 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), Malesko, 534 U.S. at 75, 122 S.Ct. 515 (Scalia, J., concurring), Hernández, 589 U.

2021-048,73,"Our Constitution's separation of powers prohibits federal courts from assuming legislative authority. As the Court today acknowledges, Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), crossed that line by implying a new set of private rights and liabilities Congress never ordained. Ante, at 1802-1803, see also Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001), Nestlé USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U.

2021-048,74,"Recognizing its misstep, this Court has struggled for decades to find its way back. Initially, the Court told lower courts to follow a two step inquiry before applying Bivens to any new situation. Ante, at 1803. At the first step, a court had to ask whether the case before it presented a new context meaningfully different from Bivens. Ante, at 1803. At the second, a court had to consider whether `special factors' counseled hesitation before recognizing a new cause of action. Ibid. But these tests soon produced their own set of questions: What distinguishes the first step from the second? What makes a context new or a factor special? And, most fundamentally, on what authority may courts recognize new causes of action even under these standards?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-048,75,"Today, the Court helpfully answers some of these lingering questions. It recognizes that our two-step inquiry really boils down to a single question: Is there any reason to think Congress might be better equipped than a court to `weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed'? Ante, at 1803-1804, see Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. 120, ___ - ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858-1859 (2017). But, respectfully, resolving that much only serves to highlight the larger remaining question: When might a court ever be better equipped than the people's elected representatives to weigh the costs and benefits of creating a cause of action?  It seems to me that to ask the question is to answer it. To create a new cause of action is to assign new private rights and liabilities—a power that is in every meaningful sense an act of legislation. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286-287, 121 S.Ct. 1511, Nestlé, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1942-1943 (GORSUCH, J., concurring), Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. at 1413 (2018) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). If exercising that sort of authority may once have been a `proper function for common-law courts' in England, it is no longer generally appropriate `for federal tribunals' in a republic where the people elect representatives to make the rules that govern them. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 287, 121 S.Ct. 1511. Weighing the costs and benefits of new laws is the bread and butter of legislative committees. It has no place in federal courts charged with deciding cases and controversies under existing law.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-048,76,"Instead of saying as much explicitly, however, the Court proceeds on to conduct a case-specific analysis. And there I confess difficulties. The plaintiff is an American citizen who argues that a federal law enforcement officer violated the Fourth Amendment in searching the curtilage of his home. Candidly, I struggle to see how this set of facts differs meaningfully from those in Bivens itself. To be sure, as the Court emphasizes, the episode here took place near an international border and the officer's search focused on violations of the immigration laws. But why does that matter? The Court suggests that Fourth Amendment violations matter less in this context because of likely national-security risks. Ante, at 1805-1806. So once more, we tote up for ourselves the costs and benefits of a private right of action in this or that setting and reach a legislative judgment. To atone for Bivens, it seems we continue repeating its most basic mistake.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-048,77,"Of course, the Court's real messages run deeper than its case-specific analysis. If the costs and benefits do not justify a new Bivens action on facts so analogous to Bivens itself, it's hard to see how they ever could. And if the only question is whether a court is better equipped than Congress to weigh the value of a new cause of action, surely the right answer will always be no. Doubtless, these are the lessons the Court seeks to convey. I would only take the next step and acknowledge explicitly what the Court leaves barely implicit. Sometimes, it seems, this Court leaves a door ajar and holds out the possibility that someone, someday might walk through it even as it devises a rule that ensures no one  ever will. Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1566 (2021) (GORSUCH, J., concurring). In fairness to future litigants and our lower court colleagues, we should not hold out that kind of false hope, and in the process invite still more protracted litigation destined to yield nothing. Nestlé, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1943 (GORSUCH, J., concurring). Instead, we should exercise the truer modesty of ceding an ill-gotten gain, ibid., and forthrightly return the power to create new causes of action to the people's representatives in Congress.",Gorsuch,0,

The Court goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid this result: It rewrites a legal standard it established just five years ago, stretches national-security concerns beyond recognition, and discerns an alternative remedial structure where none exists. The Court's innovations, taken together, enable it to close the door to Boule's claim and, presumably, to others that fall squarely within Bivens' ambit.",Sotomayor,0,

2021-048,85,"Boule is a U. S. citizen who owns, operates, and lives in a small bed-and-breakfast called the Smuggler's Inn in Blaine, Washington. The property line of the land on which the inn is located touches the U. S.-Canada border. Shortly after purchasing the property in 2000, Boule became aware that people used his property to cross the border illegally in both directions. Boule began serving as a paid, confidential informant for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2003 and for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2008. At the time of the events at issue in this case, Boule was still serving as an informant for ICE. ICE would coordinate with CBP and other agencies based on the information Boule provided. Over the years, Boule provided information leading to numerous arrests.",Sotomayor,0,

Agent Egbert asked Boule about guests at the inn, and Boule advised him of a guest he expected to arrive that day from New York who had flown in from Turkey the day before. Boule explained that two of his employees were en route to pick the guest up at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Agent Egbert continued patrolling in his CBP vehicle for the rest of the morning but stayed near the inn so he would see when the car carrying the guest returned. When it arrived, he followed the car into the driveway of the inn, passing a no trespassing sign. Agent Egbert parked his vehicle behind the arriving car in the driveway immediately adjacent to the inn.",Sotomayor,0,

Boule again asked Agent Egbert to leave. Agent Egbert grabbed Boule by his chest, lifted him up, and shoved him against the vehicle and then threw him to the ground. Boule landed on his hip and shoulder.",Sotomayor,0,

These agencies did so, but none found that Boule had done anything wrong. Boule paid over $5,000 to his accountant to assist him in responding to the IRS' tax audit. Boule also filed claims pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which were denied.

The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that both claims were cognizable under Bivens. In the Court of Appeals' view, Boule's Fourth Amendment claim constituted a modest extension of Bivens. Even so, the court explained, no special factors counseled hesitation such that this extension should be foreclosed, rather, Boule's Fourth Amendment excessive force claim is part and parcel of the `common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement' that remained a permissible area for Bivens claims. 998 F.3d 370, 389 (C.A.9 2021) (quoting Ziglar, 582 U.

2021-048,97,"This Court has twice extended the cause of action first articulated in Bivens: first to a Fifth Amendment due process claim for sex discrimination, see Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979), and then to an Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim for failure to provide proper medical attention, see Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980). In Davis, Carlson, and subsequent cases, the Court built on Bivens' inquiry to develop a two-step test for determining whether a Bivens cause of action may be defeated. Carlson, 446 U.S. at 18, 100 S.Ct. 1468. First, the Court considered whether, under the circumstances of a particular case, special factors counseled hesitation in allowing a private right of action to proceed. See, e.g., Bivens, 403 U.S. at 396, 91 S.Ct. 1999, Davis, 442 U.S. at 246, 99 S.Ct. 2264, Carlson, 446 U.S. at 18, 100 S.Ct. 1468, Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 377-380, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983). Second, the Court considered whether Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective. Carlson, 446 U.S. at 18-19, 100 S.Ct. 1468, see also, e.g., Davis, 442 U.S. at 246-247, 99 S.Ct. 2264, Bush, 462 U.S. at 377-378, 103 S.Ct. 2404, Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537, 550, 127 S.Ct. 2588, 168 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007) (describing this two-step test). Where, for example, Congress crafted an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations, Bush, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S.Ct. 2404, this Court concluded that it would be inappropriate  to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy, id., at 368, 103 S.Ct. 2404, accord, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412, 414, 108 S.Ct. 2460, 101 L.Ed.2d 370 (1988).

2021-048,98,"In Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. 120, the Court not only declined to extend Bivens but also revised and narrowed its two-step analytic framework. The Ziglar Court set forth a new inquiry requiring courts considering a Bivens claim first to ask whether a case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases decided by this  Court and therefore arises in a new  context. 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1859, see also Hernández v. Mesa, 589 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742-743 (2020). The Ziglar Court offered a laundry list of differences that might be meaningful, including the rank of the officers involved, the constitutional right at issue, the generality or specificity of the official action, the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted, the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating, the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches, or the presence of potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider. 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., 1860. The Court recognized, however, that some differences will be so trivial that they will not suffice to create a new Bivens context. Id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1865.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,99,"If the differences are in fact meaningful ones, ibid., then the context is new, id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1859-1860, and a court proceeds to the second step of the analysis, Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 743. The second step requires courts to consider whether special factors counsel hesitation in recognizing a Bivens remedy in a new context. Ziglar, 582 U.

2021-048,100,"Importantly, even as the Ziglar Court grafted a more demanding new-context inquiry onto the traditional Bivens framework, the Court emphasized that its opinion was not intended to cast doubt on the continued force, or even the necessity, of Bivens in the search-and-seizure context in which it arose. 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1856. Quite the opposite: The Court recognized that Bivens vindicates the Constitution by allowing some redress for injuries and provides instruction and guidance to federal law enforcement officers going forward. 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1856-1857. Accordingly, the Court explained, there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens in the common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement. Ibid. The Court further recognized that individual instances of discrimination or law enforcement overreach are, by their nature, difficult to address except by way of damages actions after the fact. Id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1862.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,102,"Ziglar and Hernández control here. Applying the two-step framework set forth in those cases, the Court of Appeals' determination that Boule's Fourth Amendment claim is cognizable under Bivens should be affirmed for two independent reasons. First, Boule's claim does not present a new context. Second, even if it did, no special factors would counsel hesitation.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,104,"Boule's Fourth Amendment claim does not arise in a new context. Bivens itself involved a U.

Those are precisely the facts of Boule's complaint.",Sotomayor,0,

As discussed, however, this Court's precedent instructs that some differences are too trivial  to create a new Bivens context. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct.,  at 1865.2 That it was a CBP agent rather than a Federal Bureau of Narcotics agent who unlawfully entered Boule's property and used constitutionally excessive force against him plainly is not the sort of meaningful distinction that our new-context inquiry is designed to weed out. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,106,"It is of course well established that a Bivens suit involving an entirely `new category of defendants' arises in a `new context.' Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1857, see also Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742-743. The Court, however, has never relied on this principle to draw artificial distinctions between line-level officers of the 83 different federal law enforcement agencies with authority to make arrests and provide police protection. See Dept. of Justice, C. Brooks, Federal Law Enforcement Officers, 2016—Statistical Tables (NCJ 251922, Oct. 2019), https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fleo16st.pdf. Indeed, if the new context inquiry were defined at such a fine level of granularity, every case would raise a new context, because the Federal Bureau of Narcotics no longer exists.

2021-048,107,"Moreover, the new category of defendants language traces back to a different concern raised in the Court's decision in Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 68, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001). That case involved an Eighth Amendment claim brought by a federal prisoner against a private corporation under contract with the federal Bureau of Prisons. The Court observed that the threat of suit against an individual's employer, rather than the individual directly responsible for the alleged injury, was not the kind of deterrence contemplated by Bivens. Id., at 70-71, 122 S.Ct. 515. Applying Bivens to a corporate defendant would amount to a marked extension of Bivens  to contexts that would not advance Bivens' core purpose of deterring individual officers from engaging in unconstitutional wrongdoing. Malesko, 534 U.S. at 74, 122 S.Ct. 515, see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 485, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (declining to allow a Bivens claim to proceed against a federal agency for similar reasons). Here, by contrast, Boule's suit against Agent Egbert directly advances that core purpose.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,108,"At bottom, Boule's claim is materially indistinguishable from the claim brought in Bivens. His case therefore does not present a new context for the purposes of assessing whether a Bivens remedy is available.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,110,"Even assuming that this case presents a new context, no special factors warrant foreclosing a Bivens action.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,111,"The Court has not defined the phrase `special factors counselling hesitation,' but it has recognized that the inquiry must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1857-1858, see also Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140  S.Ct., at 742-744. For example, where a claim would call into question the formulation and implementation of a general policy or require courts to interfere in an intrusive way with sensitive functions of the Executive Branch, recognizing a Bivens action may be inappropriate. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ - ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1860-1861, see also, e.g., Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 300, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983) (declining to extend Bivens where military personnel sought damages from superior officers, citing concerns about tampering with the established relationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers, which lies at the heart of the necessarily unique structure of the Military Establishment).

2021-048,112,"Here, the only possible special factor is that Boule's property abuts an international border. Boule's case, however, is a far cry from others in which the Court declined to extend Bivens for reasons of national security or foreign relations. In Hernández, for example, a CBP agent shot and killed a Mexican child across the U. S.-Mexico border. 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 740. The Mexican Government unsuccessfully sought extradition of the agent to Mexico, and after an investigation, the U. S. Department of Justice declined to bring charges against the agent. Ibid. The parents of the deceased child attempted to bring a Bivens action against the CBP agent, but this Court held that several warning flags counseled caution, including a potential effect on foreign relations. Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 744. The Court observed that a cross-border shooting is by definition an international incident, and that both the United States and Mexico had legitimate and important interests that may be affected by the way in which this matter is handled. Id., at ___, ___, 140 S.Ct., at 744, 745. The Court concluded that because regulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestionably has national security implications, the risk of undermining border security provides reason to hesitate before extending Bivens into this field. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 747.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,113,"The conduct here took place near an international border and involved a CBP agent. That, however, is where the similarities with Hernández begin and end. The conduct occurred exclusively on U. S. soil, and the injury was to a U. S. citizen. This case therefore does not present an international incident that might affect diplomatic relations, unlike the cross-border killing of a foreign-national child. As for national-security concerns, the Court in Hernández emphasized that some CBP agents are stationed right at the border and have the responsibility of attempting to prevent illegal entry, it was for this reason, among others, that their conduct had a clear and strong connection to national security. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 746. Here, by contrast, Agent Egbert was not attempting to prevent illegal entry or otherwise engaged in activities with a strong connection to national security. Ibid. Agent Egbert was aware (because Boule had told him earlier in the day and again at the scene) that the foreign national arriving at the inn had already entered the United States by airplane and had been processed by U. S. customs at the airport in New York the previous day.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,114,"Nor does this case present special factors similar to those that deterred the Court from recognizing a Bivens action in Ziglar. In that case, foreign nationals who had been unlawfully present in the United States brought a Bivens action against three high executive officers in the Department of Justice and two wardens of  the facility where they had been held. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1851. The Court reasoned that allowing the plaintiffs' claims to proceed against the executive officers would call into question the formulation and implementation of a general policy, and that the discovery and litigation process would border upon or directly implicate the discussion and deliberations that led to the formation of the policy in question, thereby implicating sensitive national-security functions entrusted to Congress and the President. Id., at ___ - ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1860-1861. If Bivens liability were imposed, the Court explained, high officers who face personal liability for damages might refrain from taking urgent and lawful action in a time of crisis, and the costs and difficulties of later litigation might intrude upon and interfere with the proper exercise of their office. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1863.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,115,"Here, Boule plainly does not seek to challenge or alter high-level executive policy. Id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1860. Allowing his claim to proceed would not require courts to intrude into the discussion and deliberations that led to the formation of any policy or national-security decision or interest. Id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1861. Agent Egbert, a line officer, was engaged in a run-of-the-mill inquiry into the status of a foreign national on U. S. soil who had no actual or suggested ties to terrorism, and who recently had been through U. S. customs to boot. See id., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1862-1863 (distinguishing a challenge to individual instances of discrimination or law enforcement overreach, which lends itself to a Bivens action, from a challenge to large-scale policy decisions, which does not). No special factors counsel against allowing Boule's Bivens action to proceed.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,117,"Boule also argues that his First Amendment retaliatory-investigation claim is cognizable under Bivens. I concur in the Court's judgment that it is not, but I arrive at that conclusion by following precedent rather than by applying the Court's new, single-step inquiry. Ante, at 1803, see infra, at 1818-1820.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,118,"This Court has repeatedly assumed without deciding that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims, see Wood v. Moss, 572 U.S. 744, 757, 134 S.Ct. 2056, 188 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2014), but has never squarely held as much, see Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 663, n. 4, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012). Accordingly, Boule's First Amendment retaliation presents a new context for the purpose of the Bivens analysis. See Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (noting that a case can present a new context if it implicates a different constitutional right than those already recognized as cognizable under Bivens).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,119,"Moving to the second step of the Bivens inquiry, unlike Boule's Fourth Amendment claim, there is reason to pause before extending Bivens to Boule's First Amendment claim. Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 742-743. In particular, his First Amendment claim raises line-drawing concerns similar to those this Court identified in Wilkie, 551 U.S. 537, 127 S.Ct. 2588, 168 L.Ed.2d 389. In Wilkie, a landowner sought to bring a Bivens action against federal officials whom the landowner accused of harassment and intimidation meant to extract an easement across his property. 551 U.S. at 541, 127 S.Ct. 2588. The Court observed that defining a workable cause of action for such a claim was difficult. Id., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 2588, see also id., at 557, 127 S.Ct. 2588. Recognizing a Bivens action to redress retaliation under such circumstances would, in the Court's view, invite claims in every sphere of legitimate governmental action  affecting property interests and across this enormous swath of potential litigation would hover the difficulty of devising a  standard that could guide an employee's conduct and a judicial factfinder's conclusion. 551 U.S. at 561, 127 S.Ct. 2588. Because of the elusiveness of a limiting principle for claims like the landowner's, id., at 561, n. 11, 127 S.Ct. 2588, the Court decided that courts were ill equipped to tailor an appropriate remedy, id., at 562, 127 S.Ct. 2588.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,120,"Boule's First Amendment retaliation claim raises similar concerns. Unlike the constitutional rights this Court has recognized as cognizable under Bivens, First Amendment retaliation claims could potentially be brought against many different federal officers, stretching substantially beyond the common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement to reach virtually all federal employees. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 756. Under such circumstances, this Court's precedent holds that `evaluating the impact of a new species of litigation' on the efficiency of civil service is a task for Congress, not the courts. Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 562, 127 S.Ct. 2588, see also Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858. I therefore concur in the judgment as to the Court's reversal of the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Boule's First Amendment Bivens action may proceed, not for the reasons the Court identifies, ante, at 1806-1808, but because precedent requires it.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,122,"If the legal standard the Court articulates to reject Boule's Fourth Amendment claim sounds unfamiliar, that is because it is. Just five years after circumscribing the standard for allowing Bivens claims to proceed, a restless and newly constituted Court sees fit to refashion the standard anew to foreclose remedies in yet more cases. The measures the Court takes to ensure Boule's claim is dismissed are inconsistent with governing precedent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,124,"Two Terms ago, this Court reiterated and reaffirmed Ziglar's two-step test for assessing whether a claim may be brought as a Bivens action. See Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 743 (When asked to extend Bivens, we engage in a two-step inquiry). Today, however, the Court pays lip service to the test set out in our precedents, but effectively replaces it with a new single-step inquiry designed to constrict Bivens. Ante, at 1803 (acknowledging this Court's previous two step standard but insisting that those steps often resolve to a single question: whether there is any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy), ante, at 1804 (positing that the newness of some `new contexts' should alone require dismissal (some internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court goes so far as to announce that the Bivens inquiry does not invite federal courts to independently assess the costs and benefits of implying a cause of action, ante, at 1805, instead, courts must only decide whether there is any rational reason (even one) to think that Congress is better suited to `weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed,' ibid. (quoting Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1857-1858).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,125,"That approach contrasts starkly with the standard the Court announced in Ziglar and applied in Hernández. This Court regularly has considered whether courts are well suited  to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed, Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1858, and have never held that such weighing is categorically impermissible, contrary to the Court's  analysis today. See also Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 554, 127 S.Ct. 2588 (noting that the Bivens inquiry asks courts to weigh reasons for and against the creation of a new cause of action).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,126,"The Court justifies its innovations by selectively quoting our precedents and presenting its newly announced standard as if it were always the rule. The Court's repeated citation to United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987), is just one example. The Court cites Stanley for, among other things, the proposition that the special-factors analysis must be conducted at a very broad level of generality. Ante, at 1805. Stanley, however, cautioned against a case-specific special-factors analysis in the narrow context of judicial intrusion upon military discipline. 483 U.S. at 681, 107 S.Ct. 3054. As it had in previous cases seeking to raise Bivens actions in the military context, the Stanley Court emphasized the need to be protective of military concerns, 483 U.S. at 681, 107 S.Ct. 3054, and to avoid calling into question military discipline and decisionmaking, id., at 682, 107 S.Ct. 3054. The Court therefore determined that in the military sphere, the special-factors analysis should be applied somewhat more broadly than the respondent urged. Id., at 681, 107 S.Ct. 3054. Stanley, in other words, reflected the Court's longstanding approach to Bivens cases: considering the facts and the substantive context of each case and determining whether special factors counseled hesitation. Stanley did not purport to articulate a special-factors framework that should apply to all Bivens cases going forward.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,127,"The Court further declares that a plaintiff cannot justify a Bivens extension based on `parallel circumstances' with previous cases that have recognized a Bivens remedy. Ante, at 1808-1809. To the extent these statements suggest an exacting new-context inquiry, they are in serious tension with the Court's longstanding rule that trivial differences alone do not create a new Bivens context. See Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1865, see also ante, at 1809-1810 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment) (Candidly, I struggle to see how this set of facts differs meaningfully from those in Bivens itself ). Indeed, until today, the Court has never so much as hinted that courts should refuse to permit a Bivens action in a case involving facts substantially identical to those in Bivens itself. Supra, at 1814-1815.3",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,129,"The Court's application of its new standard to Boule's Fourth Amendment claim underscores just how novel that standard is. Even assuming the claim presents a new context, the Court's insistence that national-security concerns bar the claim directly contravenes Ziglar. Moreover, the Court's holding that a nonbinding administrative investigation process, internal to the agency and offering no meaningful  protection of the constitutional interests at stake, constitutes an alternative remedy that forecloses Bivens relief blinks reality.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,131,"The Court acknowledges the force of the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Bivens and this case present `almost parallel circumstances,' but it nonetheless concludes that a most unlikely special factor counsels hesitation: the national-security context. Ante, at 1805. By the Court's telling, Hernández declined to recognize a Bivens action because `regulating the conduct of agents at the border unquestionably has national security implications,' and the `risk of undermining border security provides reason to hesitate before extending Bivens into this field.' Ante, at 1804 (quoting Hernández, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 747). That reasoning, the Court concludes, applies here with full force because national security is at issue. Ante, at 1804-1805.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,132,"This is sheer hyperbole. Most obviously, the Court's conclusion that this case, which involves a physical assault by a federal officer against a U. S. citizen on U. S. soil, raises national security concerns does exactly what this Court counseled against just four years ago. Back then, the Court advised that national-security concerns must not become a talisman to use to ward off inconvenient claims—a `label' used to `cover a multitude of sins.' Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1862 (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 523, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)). It explained that this danger of abuse is even more heightened given the difficulty of defining the security interest in domestic cases. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1862 (internal quotation marks omitted). This case does not remotely implicate national security. The Court may wish it were otherwise, but on the facts of this case, its effort to raise the specter of national security is mere sleight of hand.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,133,"Nor is there any indication that Congress acted to deny a Bivens remedy for a case like this, which otherwise might counsel hesitation. See Bush, 462 U.S. at 368, 103 S.Ct. 2404 (declining to supplement Congress' existing scheme with a new judicial remedy). Congress has not provided that federal law enforcement officers may enter private property near a border at any time or for any purpose. Quite the contrary: Congress has determined that immigration officers may enter private lands within 25 miles of an international border without a warrant only for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States. 66 Stat. 233, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(3). This allowance is itself subject to exceptions: Officers cannot enter a dwelling for immigration enforcement purposes without a warrant. Ibid. Mere proximity to a border, in other words, did not give Agent Egbert greater license to enter Boule's property. Nor does it diminish or call into question the remedies for constitutional violations that a plaintiff may pursue, particularly where, as here, an agent unquestionably was not acting for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,134,"Remarkably, the Court goes beyond invoking its national-security talisman in this case alone. In keeping with the unprecedented level of generality the Court imports into the special-factors analysis, the Court holds that courts are not competent to authorize a damages action  against Border Patrol agents generally. Ante, at 1806. This extraordinary and gratuitous conclusion contradicts decades of precedent requiring a context-specific determination of whether a particular claim presents  special factors counseling hesitation. See supra, at 1813-1815.4",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,135,"The consequences of the Court's drive-by, categorical assertion will be severe. Absent intervention by Congress, CBP agents are now absolutely immunized from liability in any Bivens action for damages, no matter how egregious the misconduct or resultant injury. That will preclude redress under Bivens for injuries resulting from constitutional violations by CBP's nearly 20,000 Border Patrol agents, including those engaged in ordinary law enforcement activities, like traffic stops, far removed from the border. U. S. Customs and Border Protection, On a Typical Day in Fiscal Year 2021, CBP  (2022), https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/typical-day-fy2021. This is no hypothetical: Certain CBP agents exercise broad authority to make warrantless arrests and search vehicles up to 100 miles away from the border. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a), 8 C.F.R. § 287.1(a)(2) (2021). The Court's choice to foreclose liability for constitutional violations that occur in the course of such activities, based on even the most tenuous and hypothetical connection to the border (and thereby, to the nationalsecurity context), betrays the context-specific nature of Bivens and shrinks Bivens in the core Fourth Amendment law enforcement sphere where it is needed most. See Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1856-1857.5",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,137,"The Court further proclaims that Congress has provided alternative remedies that independently foreclose a Bivens action in this case. Ante, at 1806. The administrative remedy the Court perceives, however, is no remedy whatsoever.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,138,"The sole remedy the Court cites is an administrative grievance procedure that does not provide Boule with any relief. The statute on which the Court relies provides: The Secretary of Homeland Security shall have control, direction, and supervision of all employees and of all the files and records of CBP. 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(2), see ante, at 1806. Administrative regulations direct CBP to investigate alleged violations of its own standards by its own employees. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.10(a)-(b).6 The Court sees fit to defer to this procedure, even while acknowledging that complainants in Boule's position have no right to participate in the proceedings or to seek judicial review of any determination. Ante, at 1806. The Court supports its conclusion  that CBP's internal administrative grievance procedure offers an adequate remedy by insisting that we have never held that a Bivens alternative must afford rights to participation or appeal. Ante, at 1806. In the Court's view, so long as Congress or the Executive has created a remedial process that it finds sufficient to secure an adequate level of deterrence, the courts cannot second-guess that calibration by superimposing a Bivens remedy. Ibid. (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,139,"This analysis drains the concept of remedy of all meaning. To be sure, the Court has previously deemed Bivens claims foreclosed by substantive remedies to claimants that are in significant part administrative. Bush, 462 U.S. at 385, 103 S.Ct. 2404, see also, e.g., Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 424-425, 108 S.Ct. 2460. The Court also has recognized that existing remedies need not provide complete relief for the plaintiff, Bush, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S.Ct. 2404, including loss due to emotional distress or mental anguish, or attorney's fees, Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 424-425, 108 S.Ct. 2460. Until today, however, this Court has never held that a threadbare disciplinary review process, expressly conferring no substantive rights, secures adequate deterrence and affords  an alternative remedy. Ante, at 1807. Nor has it held that remedies providing no relief to the individual whose constitutional rights have been violated are adequate for the purpose of foreclosing a Bivens action. To the contrary, each of the alternative remedies the Court has recognized has afforded participatory rights, an opportunity for judicial review, and the potential to secure at least some meaningful relief. See, e.g., Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U.S. 118, 127, 132 S.Ct. 617, 181 L.Ed.2d 606 (2012) (state tort law), Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1864-1865 (petition for writ of habeas corpus or injunctive relief), Bush, 462 U.S. at 385, 103 S.Ct. 2404.7",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,140,"The Court previously has emphasized that a Bivens action may be inappropriate where Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective. Carlson, 446 U.S. at 18-19, 100 S.Ct. 1468 (emphasis deleted). Thus, our cases declining to extend Bivens have done so where Congress, sometimes in conjunction with the Executive Branch, provided comprehensive and meaningful remedies. Bush, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S.Ct. 2404, see also Schweiker, 487 U.S. at 414, 423, 428, 108 S.Ct. 2460 (emphasizing that the design of the elaborate remedial scheme in the Social Security disability program  suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration), Malesko, 534 U.S. at 72, 122 S.Ct. 515 (noting that remedies available to the plaintiff were at least as great, and in many respects greater, than anything that could be had under Bivens), Minneci, 565 U.S. at 120, 132 S.Ct. 617 (rejecting Bivens action for Eighth Amendment violations against employees of a privately operated federal prison because state tort law authorizes adequate alternative damages actions —actions that provide both significant deterrence and compensation). By the Court's logic, however, the existence of any disciplinary framework, even if crafted by the Executive Branch rather than Congress, and even if wholly nonparticipatory and lacking any judicial review, is sufficient to bar a court from recognizing a Bivens remedy. That reasoning, as disturbing as it is wrong, marks yet another erosion of Bivens' deterrent function in the law enforcement sphere.8",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,142,"The Court thinly veils its disapproval of Bivens, ending its opinion by citing a string of dissenting opinions and single-Member concurrences by various Members of this Court expressing criticisms of Bivens. Ante, at 1808-1809. But the Court unmistakably stops short of overruling Bivens and its progeny, and appropriately so. Even while declining to extend Bivens to new contexts, this Court has reaffirmed that it did not intend to cast doubt on the continued force, or even the necessity, of Bivens in the search-and-seizure context in which it arose. Ziglar, 582 U. S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1856. Although today's opinion will make it harder for plaintiffs to bring a successful Bivens claim, even in the Fourth Amendment context, the lower courts should not read it to render Bivens a dead letter.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,143,"That said, the Court plainly modifies the Bivens standard in a manner that forecloses Boule's claims and others like them that should be permitted under this Court's Bivens precedents. That choice is in tension with the Court's insistence that prescribing a cause of action is a job for Congress, not the courts. Ante, at 1800, see ante, at 1805 (cautioning against frustrating Congress's policymaking role when considering whether special factors counsel hesitation). Faithful adherence to this logic counsels maintaining Bivens in its current scope, but does not support changing the status quo to constrict Bivens, as the Court does today. Congress, after all, has recognized and relied on the Bivens cause of action in creating and amending other remedies, including the FTCA. By nevertheless repeatedly amending the legal standard that applies to Bivens claims and whittling down the number of claims that remain viable, the Court itself is making a policy choice for Congress. Whatever the merits of that choice, the Court's decision today is no exercise in judicial modesty.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2021-048,144,"This Court's precedents recognize that suits for damages play a critical role in deterring unconstitutional conduct by federal law enforcement officers and in ensuring that those whose constitutional rights have been violated receive meaningful redress. The Court's decision today ignores our repeated recognition of the importance  of Bivens actions, particularly in the Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure context, and closes the door to Bivens suits by many who will suffer serious constitutional violations at the hands of federal agents.

The Preamble makes the common defence one of the document's central projects. Article I gives Congress authority to provide for that common Defence in six numbered paragraphs: to declare War, raise and support Armies, provide and maintain a Navy, make Rules for the Armed Forces, provide for calling forth the Militia, and provide for their organizing, arming, and disciplining. § 8, cls. 1, 11-16.

See post, at 2472-2473 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). But USERRA's text is clear: Congress sought to authorize suits against state employers. The very provision to which the dissent cites is entitled Enforcement of rights with respect to a State or private employer. 38 U.S.C. § 4323. USERRA elsewhere expressly supersedes any State law  that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter, including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or the receipt of any such benefit. § 4302(b). Congress' clarification that suits proceed in a State court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of the State merely addresses the fact that USERRA suits must be brought in state (rather than federal) court. § 4323(b)(2). Under Supremacy Clause principles, Texas courts may not enforce contrary state laws to block these suits. Cf. Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 390-394, 67 S.Ct. 810, 91 L.Ed. 967 (1947).",Breyer,0,
2021-049,68,"Texas and the dissent go on to suggest that the fact that an area of law is under  the exclusive control of the Federal Government is not alone sufficient to do away with sovereign immunity. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114, see post, at 2475-2476. We agree. In Seminole Tribe, we held that Congress could not rely on its Article I commerce powers to abrogate state sovereign immunity simply because that power was exclusive. 517 U.S. at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114. But later, in PennEast, we found that the federal eminent domain power was `complete in itself,' and held that was enough to find a waiver of sovereign immunity in the constitutional structure. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2263. It thus matters to the analysis that federal regulation of commerce (at issue in Seminole Tribe) involves goods that, before they travel between States or outside a tribe, are subject to regulation by a sovereign other than the Federal Government (a State or tribe). That feature of commerce arguably makes the federal regulatory power less than complete. The dissent takes issue with this complete in itself inquiry. See post, at 2481-2486. But its quarrel lies with PennEast, which used the formulation we rely upon today.",Breyer,0,
2021-049,69,"In any event, the text, history, and precedent we have described indicate that an assertion of state sovereignty to frustrate federal prerogatives to raise and maintain military forces would be strongly contradictory and repugnant to the constitutional order.

Neither Seminole Tribe nor the cases that followed it, such as Florida Prepaid, 527 U.S. 627, 119 S.Ct. 2199, 144 L.Ed.2d 575, considered federal powers that give rise to these same structural inferences. None of those powers (e.g., Indian commerce, interstate commerce, or intellectual property) is expressly denied to the States, or operates for the benefit of the entire Nation, or proves comparably essential to the survival of the Union—itself a foundational purpose for drafting the Constitution. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30-31. These factors, taken together, lead us to conclude that the results in PennEast and Katz, not dicta in Seminole Tribe, control this case.",Breyer,0,
2021-049,70,"The dissent makes two further points. First, it quotes Alden v. Maine for the proposition that `the powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts.' Post, at 2469-2470, 2473-2474 (quoting 527 U.S. at 712, 119 S.Ct. 2240, emphasis deleted). But the dissent would give this sentence more weight than it can bear. The quoted passage appears in the introduction to the Court's opinion, and it refers summarily to Article I's general delegations (i.e., Congress' broad authority under the Supremacy Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause). See Alden, 527 U.S. at 712, 119 S.Ct. 2240, see also id., at 731-733, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (discussing same). Alden did not, in this sentence or elsewhere, suggest that there were no exceptions under which Congress could authorize private suits against States. In fact, Alden said the opposite. The Court expressly embraced `the postulate that States  shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where there has been a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention.' Id., at 730, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (quoting Principality of Monaco, 292 U.S. at 322-323, 54 S.Ct. 745, in turn quoting The Federalist No. 81, emphasis added). So, Alden made clear: In exercising its Article I powers Congress may subject the States to private suits in their own courts  if there is `compelling evidence' that the States were required to surrender this power to Congress pursuant to the Constitutional design. 527 U.S. at 730-731, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (quoting Blatchford,  501 U.S. at 781, 111 S.Ct. 2578, emphasis added). As we have discussed, PennEast and Katz recognize such exceptions as to the federal eminent domain power and the Bankruptcy Clause. And they establish the test for what constitutes compelling evidence of structural waiver.",Breyer,0,
2021-049,71,"The dissent next implies that PennEast and Katz create special rules regarding waivers of sovereign immunity in federal courts that do not apply in state courts. See post, at 2474-2475, and n. 4, 2478-2479, and n. 7. But those opinions' reasoning about our constitutional structure is not so limited, as Alden reflects. Alden held that Article I did not, in general, give Congress the power to set aside States' immunity from suit in their own courts, despite the Eleventh Amendment's silence on the subject of state courts. (The Amendment's text refers only to federal courts—The Judicial power of the United States.) Like our other state sovereign immunity cases, Alden understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms. Blatchford, 501 U.S. at 779, 111 S.Ct. 2578, see Alden, 527 U.S. at 755, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (explaining its holding is implicit in the constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity). It follows that a waiver pursuant to the plan of the Convention, as we found in PennEast and Katz, displaces the background principles of state sovereign immunity wherever those suits proceed. Neither Alden nor any other case holds to the contrary.",Breyer,0,
2021-049,72,"The dissent would leave us with a constitutional structure that allows Congress to authorize private suits against States only by abrogation under the Fourteenth Amendment, by legislation under the Bankruptcy Clause (but only for suits in federal courts), or by delegation of the federal eminent domain power (but, again, only in federal courts). The logic of that constitutional design is anything but clear.",Breyer,0,
2021-049,73,"Texas tries another tack to distinguish PennEast and Katz, focusing on a technical aspect of those cases. Texas says that both eminent domain and bankruptcy involved in rem proceedings, which are `inextricably intertwined' with the exercise of those federal powers. See Brief for Respondent 40 (quoting PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2260), see also post, at 2482-2483. The proceeding before us, Texas adds, is not in rem or so intertwined. We agree, of course, that PennEast discussed the close connection between the exercise of eminent domain and condemnation actions. See 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2260, see also Katz, 546 U.S. at 369-372, 126 S.Ct. 990. But we read PennEast as resting on a broader point: The Federal Government's eminent domain power is complete, such that no State may frustrate its exercise by claiming immunity to forestall the transfer of property. And that conclusion applies equally to Congress' powers to raise and maintain the military.",Breyer,0,
2021-049,74,"Texas further argues that Congress cannot subject it to suit under USERRA because there is no founding-era history of similar litigation against States. See Brief for Respondent 25. But PennEast did not require any such history, as the dissent acknowledges. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2261 (citing Texas, 143 U.S. at 646, 12 S.Ct. 488), see post, at 2477, n. 6. Again, in PennEast, we considered the inferences that flow from our constitutional structure and asked whether States may, consistent with that structure, claim immunity to frustrate federal objectives. And again, answering that question here, we find that the States waived their immunity under Article I, § 8, cls. 12 and 13.",Breyer,0,

2021-049,81,"In my view, our sovereign immunity decisions have not followed a straight line. Two years ago, I described Katz's plan of the Convention analysis as good for one clause only—i.e., Article I's Bankruptcy Clause. Allen v. Cooper, 589 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1002-1003, 206 L.Ed.2d 291 (2020) (hyphens omitted), see Central Va. Community College v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 373-379, 126 S.Ct. 990, 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006). I thought then that our precedents had shut the door on further Article I exceptions to state sovereign immunity. But PennEast proved me wrong. See PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2244, 210 L.Ed.2d 624 (2021). The question there was whether the States had consented in the plan of the Convention to the Federal Government's exercise of Article I's eminent domain power, including through private parties' suits. Relying on our prior decisions, I concluded that the States had not so consented. See id., at ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2265-2267 (BARRETT, J., dissenting). But the Court ruled otherwise. Using a new test, it held that the eminent domain power was complete in itself, meaning that the States had consented to the federal exercise of that power in its entirety. Id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2263. The question today, given PennEast, is whether the same is true of the war powers. Were those powers also complete in themselves, so that the States likewise consented to congressionally authorized private litigation?",Kagan,0,
2021-049,82,"The answer is yes, as the Court holds. Much more than eminent domain, war powers lie at the heart of the Convention's plan. The overriding goal of the Convention was to create a cohesive national sovereign in response to the failings of the Articles of Confederation. Ibid.

Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 381, 38 S.Ct. 159, 62 L.Ed. 349 (1918). For that reason, the war powers—more than any other power, and surely more than eminent domain—were complete in themselves. They were given by the States, entirely and exclusively, to the Federal Government. See ante, at 2463-2467, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cls. 11-16, § 10, cls. 1, 3.

Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 779, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991)), retaining a substantial portion of the Nation's primary sovereignty, together with the dignity and essential attributes inhering in that status, Alden, 527 U.S. at 714, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,

S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1493 (quoting Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 751-752, 122 S.Ct. 1864). That doctrine  was universal in the States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified, Alden, 527 U.S. at 715-716, 119 S.Ct. 2240, see also Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 16, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), because the generation that designed and adopted our federal system considered immunity from private suits central to sovereign dignity, 527 U.S. at 715, 119 S.Ct. 2240, see also, e.g., Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 760, 122 S.Ct. 1864. In fact, sovereign immunity was so important that the Constitution never would have been ratified if the States and their courts were to be stripped of their sovereign authority except as expressly provided by the Constitution itself.

Federal Maritime  Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 752, 122 S.Ct. 1864. As Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist, sovereign immunity was part of the general sense and the general practice of mankind, and the Constitution therefore left it with the States unless they had surrendered some portion of this immunity in the plan of the convention. The Federalist No. 81, pp. 487-488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), see also Hans, 134 U.S. at 13, 10 S.Ct. 504, Alden, 527 U.S. at 755, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,90,"During the Nation's first 200 years, this Court recognized only two instances in which the States had surrendered their sovereign immunity in the constitutional plan, both of which involved suits prosecuted by other sovereigns. The States had agreed to be sued by other States in this Court, see Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 328, 54 S.Ct. 745, 78 L.Ed. 1282 (1934), and by the United States in federal court, see United States v.

When it came to private litigation, however, this Court long maintained that the Framers thought it an impermissible affront to a State's dignity to be required to answer the complaints of private parties in federal courts, Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 760, 122 S.Ct. 1864, and that the Convention did not disturb States' immunity from private suits, id., at 752, 122 S.Ct. 1864.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,91,"Nevertheless, in the last two decades, the Court has recognized two surrenders of sovereign immunity in cases implicating private parties. First, in Central Va. Community College v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 126 S.Ct. 990, 163 L.Ed.2d 945 (2006), this Court held that States waived immunity against the federal discharge of debts when they ratified the Bankruptcy Clause. And, in PennEast, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2244, 210 L.Ed.2d 624, it held that States waived immunity against condemnation proceedings brought by private parties to whom the Federal Government has delegated its eminent domain power. Taken together, Katz and PennEast centered on whether or not the plan of the Convention— i.e., the Constitution itself—required States to surrender their sovereign immunity. See Katz, 546 U.S. at 379, 126 S.Ct. 990, PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2259.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,92,"These cases contrast with those that involve congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity. Abrogation rests on some statement Congress has made on the subject of state sovereign immunity. Katz, 546 U.S. at 378-379, 126 S.Ct. 990. Specifically, we have held that Congress must enact unequivocal statutory language abrogating States' immunity. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 56, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). That said, the line between plan-of-the-Convention waiver and congressional abrogation is a murky one. Both inquiries ask the same basic question: whether Congress has authorized suit against a nonconsenting State pursuant to a valid exercise of constitutional authority. Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 78, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000), see also Katz, 546 U.S. at 379, 126 S.Ct. 990 (asking whether Congress' decision to bind States to discharge orders in bankruptcy proceedings is within the scope of its power to enact `Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies'). And both inquiries center on history, practice, precedent, and the structure of the Constitution, Alden, 527 U.S. at 741, 119 S.Ct. 2240, to determine whether the Constitution either grants authority to Congress to abrogate immunity or strips States of their immunity on its own.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,93,"The parties agree that this case involves only plan-of-the-Convention waiver. Thus, the question presented is whether, in ratifying the Constitution, the States surrendered their immunity in their own courts against private damages actions authorized by Congress' war powers.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,95,"In answering that question, the Court discounts two important points. First, it creates a constitutional problem by adopting a questionable interpretation of USERRA that assumes Congress intended to legislate with indifference to States' state-law immunity. Second, the Court cannot escape the fact that Alden already answered the question presented and held that the States did not surrender their state-court immunity when ratifying Article I of the Constitution.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,97,"When it was originally enacted, USERRA authorized covered employees to sue States in federal district court. See 38 U.S.C. § 4323(b) (1994 ed.). In 1996, this Court decided Seminole Tribe, holding that Congress could not abrogate state sovereign immunity in federal courts using its Article I powers. See 517 U.S. at 72-73, 116 S.Ct. 1114. In response to Seminole Tribe, Congress amended USERRA in 1998, and the statute now provides: In the case of an action against a State (as an employer) by a person, the action may be brought in a State court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of the State. § 4323(b)(2) (emphasis added).",Thomas,0,
2021-049,98,"USERRA's requirement that employee damages actions be in accordance with the laws of the State would seem to include a State's laws that render it immune from suit in the State's own courts, as well as any laws that expressly waive such immunity. See, e.g., Tex. Govt. Code Ann. § 311.034 (West 2013), Prairie View A & M Univ. v. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d 500, 512 (Tex. 2012). In other words, there is nothing in the text of USERRA necessarily implying that Congress intended to require nonconsenting States to defend themselves in their own courts.1 The Court, however, breezes past USERRA's language to conclude that the statute authorizes private litigation against noncompliant state employers that do not wish to consent to suit. Ante, at 2461.2  To be clear, I am not disputing whether USERRA speaks clearly enough to express a congressional intent to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity in their own courts, plan-of-the-Convention waiver asks whether the States surrendered that immunity when the Constitution was ratified and thus agreed  not to assert that immunity in particular contexts. Katz, 546 U.S. at 373, 126 S.Ct. 990. But even if the Constitution itself partially strips state sovereign immunity, it would still fall to Congress to decide whether, and on what terms, to render States amenable to suit, or to permit States to assert immunity. Cf. id., at 379, 126 S.Ct. 990 (Congress may, at its option, either treat States in the same way as other creditors insofar as concerns `Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies' or exempt them from the operation of such laws).",Thomas,0,
2021-049,99,"The Court should not casually consider the constitutionality of USERRA's supposed subjection of nonconsenting States to damages actions in state court when it is not clear the statute does any such thing. By doing so, the Court gives short shrift to the well-established principle governing the prudent exercise of this Court's jurisdiction that normally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case. Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 205, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-049,101,"Having interpreted USERRA to render nonconsenting States amenable to suit, the Court goes on to distinguish Alden v. Maine without any plausible basis for doing so. In truth, Alden directly controls this case.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,102,"In Alden, a group of private plaintiffs sued the State of Maine in state court, invoking a private cause of action created by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). See 527 U.S. at 711-712, 119 S.Ct. 2240. The question presented was whether Congress has the power, under Article I, to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts. Id., at 730, 119 S.Ct. 2240. In a detailed opinion, the Court in Alden held—without qualification—that the States had not consented in the plan of the Convention to any congressionally created private damages actions in state court.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,103,"To begin, Alden framed its inquiry around plan-of-the-Convention waiver, not congressional abrogation: In exercising its Article I powers Congress may subject the States to private suits in their own courts only if there is compelling evidence that the States were required to surrender this power to Congress pursuant to the constitutional design—i.e., in the plan of the Convention. Id., at 730-731, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted), see also ante, at 2461-2462. In determining whether such evidence existed, Alden began with the text of the Constitution. See 527 U.S. at 731, 119 S.Ct. 2240. It recognized that Article I, § 8, grants  Congress broad powers to enact legislation in several enumerated areas of national concern—including, of course, the war powers. Ibid. But neither the breadth of those powers nor their connection to areas of national concern sufficed to show that States ratified the Constitution with the understanding that they had surrendered to Congress any power to authorize private damages actions against them in their own courts. See id., at 731-733, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,104,"Alden spoke emphatically and categorically when explaining why the States had effected no such surrender. We found it  telling that no one, not even the Constitution's most ardent opponents, suggested the document might strip the States of their immunity from suit in their own courts. Id., at 741, 119 S.Ct. 2240. That was likely because the sovereign's right to assert immunity from suit in its own courts was a principle so well established that no one conceived it would be altered by the new Constitution. Ibid. (emphasis added). We explained how the founding generation's concern that Article III might be used to circumvent state-court immunity counseled against inferring that the Constitution stripped the States of immunity in their own courts and allowed Congress to subject them to suit there. Id., at 743, 119 S.Ct. 2240. Rather, in light of the historical record, we found it difficult to conceive that the Constitution would have been adopted if it had been understood to strip the States of immunity from suit in their own courts and cede to the Federal Government a power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits in these fora. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,105,"Importantly, the scope of Alden's holding was broad: We hold that the powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts. Id., at 712, 119 S.Ct. 2240, see also id., at 754, 119 S.Ct. 2240. That holding plainly applied to all Article I powers. Thus, we did not engage in a clause-by-clause parsing of Article I's various powers, nor did we even mention which Article I power authorized the FLSA. It did not matter because the States would not have surrendered to Congress any of the immunity they enjoyed in their own courts.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,106,"Finally, concluding its analysis, Alden contrasted the States' amenability to suit by the United States on behalf of the employees with a suit by the employees themselves, holding that history, precedent, and the structure of the Constitution make clear that, under the plan of the Convention, the States have consented to suits of the first kind but not of the second. Id., at 759-760, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (emphasis added).3 The question that Alden answered plainly embraces the one that the Court answers today. And there is no serious dispute that Alden's explicit holding is irreconcilable with the Court's holding here.* * *",Thomas,0,
2021-049,107,"Until today, Alden meant what it said. Both Katz and PennEast considered plan-of-the-Convention waivers applicable to federal, not state, court. See Katz, 546 U.S. at 360, 126 S.Ct. 990, PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2253. Nothing in those decisions, therefore, undermined Alden's categorical holding.4 It is only the  Court's holding today that does so. I would adhere to Alden and reaffirm that the States did not surrender the immunity applicable in their own courts when they delegated the enumerated powers—including the war powers—to Congress in Article I. And, because Torres has not invoked a waiver of immunity under state law, I would affirm the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,109,"Even if Alden's holding were not alone dispositive, thus requiring us to consider our plan of the Convention precedents applicable to private actions in federal court, I would still conclude that the States have not waived their immunity to private damages actions authorized by the war powers.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,110,"Our settled test for plan-of-the-Convention waiver is a stringent one: We cannot infer a waiver of sovereign immunity unless there is compelling evidence that the Founders thought such a surrender inherent in the constitutional compact. Blatchford, 501 U.S. at 781, 111 S.Ct. 2578, see also Alden, 527 U.S. at 731, 119 S.Ct. 2240. Compelling evidence of this sort includes evidence of the original understanding of the Constitution, id., at 741, 119 S.Ct. 2240, early congressional practice, id., at 743, 119 S.Ct. 2240, the structure of the Constitution itself, id., at 748, 119 S.Ct. 2240, and the theory and reasoning of our earlier cases, id., at 745, 119 S.Ct. 2240, see also id., at 754, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,111,"Applying this test, it is clear that the States did not implicitly agree to surrender their state-court immunity against congressional exercises of the war powers.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,113,"Torres claims (and the Court agrees) that the original understanding of the Constitution's text implies that the States agreed to surrender their immunity against private actions authorized by Congress' war powers, which include eight powers enumerated in Article I, § 8, along with the Necessary and Proper Clause. See Brief for Petitioner 4 (invoking Art. I, § 8, cls. 1, 10-16, 18), see also ante, at 2463-2464 (listing Art. I, § 8, cls. 1, 11-16). In support of that argument, Torres and the Court point out that the war powers delegated to Congress are sweeping, and that Article I, § 10, expressly and completely divests States of various war-related powers. See ante, at 2463-2464, Brief for Petitioner 24. This argument falters on at least two fronts.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,114,"First, Seminole Tribe long ago explained that the breadth and exclusivity of a federal power does not authorize Congress to subject nonconsenting States to private damages actions. Seminole Tribe involved a federal cause of action created pursuant to Congress' authority under the Indian Commerce Clause, see 517 U.S. at  60, 116 S.Ct. 1114, which this Court has said grants Congress `plenary and exclusive' powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes, United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004). Although Seminole Tribe recognized that States had been divested of virtually all authority over Indian commerce and Indian tribes, 517 U.S. at 62, 116 S.Ct. 1114, the Court nonetheless held that state sovereign immunity  is not so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an area  that is under the exclusive control of the Federal Government, id., at 72, 116 S.Ct. 1114. That the Constitution vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area, we explained, does not implicitly authorize Congress to abrogate immunity with respect to that power. Ibid.5",Thomas,0,
2021-049,115,"Nor is the answer different when the exclusive federal exercise of a particular power is reinforced by an explicit divestment of state authority under Article I, § 10. Our precedents teach that whenever a power is exercised exclusively by Congress, the subject is as completely taken from the State Legislatures, as if they had been expressly forbidden to act on it. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 193, 17 U.S. 122, 4 L.Ed. 529 (1819) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court) (emphasis added). Whether or not a prohibition on state power also appears in Article I, § 10, is irrelevant when deciding whether the Constitution has granted Congress power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,116,"Second, even if express textual divestment of state power were relevant, Torres and the Court incorrectly conclude that the specific divestments listed in Article I, § 10, provide strong evidence supporting a complete delegation of authority to the Federal Government to provide for the common defense. Ante, at 2463-2464. States obviously have no authority to take certain actions specified in Article I, § 10. They cannot, for example, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace  unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay without the consent of Congress. Art. I, § 10, cl. 3. But to say that Congress' much more general authority to raise and support Armies, Art. I, § 8, cl. 12, acts to completely derogate all state authority related to the subject is inaccurate.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,117,"States have significant residual police powers that overlap with Congress' power over the military. For example, we have sustained state legislation related to the enlistment of men in the U. S. Army and Navy against the charge that `all power of legislation regarding the subject matter is conferred upon Congress and withheld from the States.' Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U.S. 325, 327-328, 41 S.Ct. 125, 65 L.Ed. 287 (1920). In doing so, we rejected the idea that a State has no interest or concern in the United States or its armies or power of protecting them from public enemies, and eschewed any cold and technical reasoning that insists on a separation of the sovereignties in the army-raising context. Id., at 328-329, 41 S.Ct. 125. Similarly, we have held that there is no clause of the Constitution which purports, unaided by Congressional enactment, to prohibit States from exercising their police powers in ways that arguably burden Congress' power to raise and support armies. Penn Dairies, Inc. v. Milk Control Comm'n of Pa., 318 U.S. 261,  269, 63 S.Ct. 617, 87 L.Ed. 748 (1943). Nor have we implied from the relationship of the two governments established by the Constitution any such prohibition. Ibid. State regulations inevitably impose some burdens on the national government, but those are the normal incidents of the operation within the same territory of a dual system of government, and they may persist save as Congress may act to remove them. Id., at 271, 63 S.Ct. 617. Therefore, even though the Army and Navy Clauses grant Congress exclusive authority over raising and supporting armies and navies, that exclusivity is no different from that which attends any other Article I power.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,118,"To nonetheless find plan-of-the-Convention waiver, as Torres proposes and the Court accepts, is to hold that a congressional power to pre-empt state law alone demonstrates a State's surrender of sovereign immunity. That line of reasoning, apart from being foreclosed by Seminole Tribe, proves too much. The upshot is that the States would have consented in the plan of the Convention to surrender their immunity against the exercise of any Article I power. Because such a result is a dramatic departure from our precedents, and the power granted to Congress under the Army and Navy Clauses does not displace state regulation any more readily or completely than other Article I powers, these arguments from constitutional text provide no sound basis for authorizing private actions against nonconsenting States.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,120,"Constitutional history and practice do Torres and the Court no better. To begin, we must view the historical evidence in light of the presumption that no anomalous and unheard-of proceedings or suits were intended to be raised up by the Constitution. Hans, 134 U.S. at 18, 10 S.Ct. 504, see also Alden, 527 U.S. at 727, 119 S.Ct. 2240. Applying that presumption, the Court in the past has attributed great significance to the absence of analogous suits at the time of the founding or for many years thereafter. Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 755, 122 S.Ct. 1864.6 Moreover, the presumption is arguably at its strongest here, for private damages actions were precisely the type of proceedings from which the Framers would have thought the States possessed immunity. Id., at 756, 122 S.Ct. 1864. The Framers would have thought it an impermissible affront to a State's dignity to require it to defend itself in an adversarial proceeding against a private party. Id., at 760-761, 122 S.Ct. 1864.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,121,"To overcome that presumption, Torres and the Court invoke some historical sources that generally discuss the scope and importance of Congress' war-related powers. See Brief for Petitioner 26-37, ante, at 2464-2465. But virtually none of them addresses directly the central question  here: whether the States understood that they had surrendered their sovereign immunity from suit in their own courts when delegating those powers to Congress. Instead, the founding-era history is largely silent on this question, and that silence is most instructive in confirming that no one conceived that state sovereign immunity would be altered by the new Constitution's distribution of war powers. Alden, 527 U.S. at 741, 119 S.Ct. 2240. The Founders' silence is best explained by the simple fact that no one  suggested the document might strip the States of their immunity under the war powers. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,122,"More specifically, Torres (but not the Court) points to the 1783 Treaty of Paris. He maintains that private actions would not have been anomalous to the Founders because they expected British creditors to sue States under the treaty in order to collect on their debts. See Brief for Petitioner 27-31. But it is not likely that the Founders did, in fact, expect foreign creditor suits against States, it is more likely that they expected creditors to sue their individual debtors and rely on the Treaty to defeat any state law defenses. B. Clark, The Eleventh Amendment and the Nature of the Union, 123 Harv. L. Rev. 1817, 1910 (2010). And when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted to restore the original constitutional design after Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793), Alden, 527 U.S. at 722, 119 S.Ct. 2240, Congress refused to make an exception for cases arising under treaties made under the authority of the United States, id., at 721, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress' refusal to modify the text of the Eleventh Amendment to create an exception to sovereign immunity for cases arising under treaties suggests that the States' immunity from private-party litigation extended even to treaty-based claims. Id., at 735, 119 S.Ct. 2240, see also D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period 1789-1801, p. 197 (1997).",Thomas,0,
2021-049,123,"Early congressional practice accords with the Framers' assumption that Congress could not use any Article I power to subject the States to private damages actions in their own courts. In fact, we already have discovered no instance in which early Congresses purported to authorize suits against nonconsenting States in state courts. Alden, 527 U.S. at 744, 119 S.Ct. 2240. Contrasted against the numerous statutes authorizing other federal suits in state courts, it appears early Congresses did not believe they had the power to authorize private suits against the States in their own courts. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,125,"Constitutional structure also cuts decisively against inferring a surrender of state sovereign immunity in this context. See id., at 748-754, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,126,"First and most fundamentally, all private suits against nonconsenting States present `the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.' Id., at 749, 119 S.Ct. 2240 (quoting In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 505, 8 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.Ed. 216 (1887)). USERRA's cause of action is uniquely offensive to the States' dignity because it purports to press a State's own courts into federal service to coerce the other branches of the State, thereby turning the State against itself and commandeering the entire political machinery of the State against its will and at the behest of individuals. Alden, 527 U.S. at 749, 119 S.Ct. 2240. That kind of plenary federal control of state governmental processes denigrates the separate sovereignty of the States. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,127,"Second, congressional authorization of private damages actions threatens the financial integrity of the States. Id., at 750, 119 S.Ct. 2240. It can create staggering burdens and give Congress a power and a leverage over the States that is not contemplated by our constitutional design. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,128,"Third, representative government itself is jeopardized when deliberation by the political process established by the citizens of the State is replaced with judicial decree mandated by the Federal Government and invoked by the private citizen. Id., at 751, 119 S.Ct. 2240.

2021-049,129,"Notwithstanding these countervailing structural concerns, both Torres and the Court think that constitutional structure supports finding plan-of-the-Convention waiver because confirming States' sovereign immunity in their own courts would supposedly threaten the Federal Government's power to wage war successfully and jeopardize the Nation's safety. Ante, at 2465 (quoting Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 780, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694 (1948), internal quotation marks omitted), Brief for Petitioner 26. But this argument conflates the preservation of state sovereign immunity with a license to interfere with federal warmaking. As we already cautioned in Alden, The constitutional privilege of a State to assert its sovereign immunity in its own courts does not confer upon the State a concomitant right to disregard the Constitution or valid federal law. 527 U.S. at 754-755, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,130,"For example, the Court notes that early Congresses established military bonuses to reward service, even requiring Virginia to give land to some Revolutionary War officers. Ante, at 2464 (citing Act of Aug. 10, 1790, ch. 40, 1 Stat. 182).8 It asks, incredulously, Could Virginia have refused to go along? Ante, at 2464. But that question is a non sequitur. No one disputes the supremacy of federal power in the area of military affairs. Perpich v. Department of Defense, 496 U.S. 334, 351, 110 S.Ct. 2418, 110 L.Ed.2d 312 (1990). Instead, all agree that the United States could lawfully sue Virginia in federal court to secure an injunction requiring it to comply  with federal law. In fact, USERRA already authorizes suits by the United States to enforce USERRA's requirements. § 4323(a)(1). And even if private suits were necessary to enforce the federal scheme, individuals could still sue in equity to enjoin state officials from violating federal law, see Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), or, if Congress authorizes it, pursue damages actions against such state officials in their individual capacities, see, e.g., Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Ultimately, if the Court reaffirmed Texas' sovereign immunity, established rules provide ample means to correct ongoing violations of law and to vindicate the interests which animate the Supremacy Clause. Alden, 527 U.S. at 757, 119 S.Ct. 2240.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,132,"Finally, our precedents do not support finding a surrender of state sovereign immunity here. As explained above, Alden is the most on-point precedent—and, in fact, our only recent precedent discussing States' immunity from suit in their own courts. It therefore disposes of this case. Neither Katz nor PennEast supports a different result.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,133,"Katz found plan-of-the-Convention waiver based on the singular nature of bankruptcy jurisdiction and the Bankruptcy Clause's unique history. 546 U.S. at 369, n. 9, 126 S.Ct. 990. As the Court later explained, Katz viewed bankruptcy as on a different plane, governed by principles all its own, and nothing in its analysis invites the kind of general, clause-by-clause reexamination of Article I that the Court endorses today.

2021-049,134,"For its part, PennEast emphasized several factors unique to the eminent domain context. First, PennEast discussed the Federal Government's long history of exercising the power of eminent domain— including its delegation of that power to private parties to take property within state boundaries. See 594 U.S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2254-2255. Here, there is a long history showing that the Federal Government exercised its war powers, but there is no comparable history of the Federal Government using those powers to impose financial liabilities on States enforceable by private parties. Nor is there any evidence demonstrating that any kind of judicial proceedings—let alone private damages actions—are inextricably intertwined with the war powers in the way that judicial condemnation actions are intertwined with eminent domain. See supra, at 2477, n. 6.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,135,"Second, PennEast emphasized that the Constitution vests the Federal Government `with full and complete power to execute and carry out its purposes'— including the power of eminent domain— and that history shows that the Government may exercise that sovereign power through private delegatees. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2259. Here, there is no argument that employees granted a cause of action under USERRA are delegatees of the war powers in any meaningful sense.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,136,"Third, PennEast reasoned that recognizing New Jersey's immunity claim would require federal delegatees to take state property, thereby forcing States to file inverse condemnation actions for just compensation. See id., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2260. The Court did not think that kind of arrangement would vindicate the principles underlying state sovereign immunity, including the principle of affording States the respect owed them as joint sovereigns. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, by contrast, there is no  sense in which confirming Texas' immunity would similarly undermine the principles underlying that immunity.* * *",Thomas,0,
2021-049,137,"In the end, the history, practice, precedent, and the structure of the Constitution all demonstrate that States did not surrender their sovereign immunity in their own courts when Congress legislates pursuant to one of its war powers.

2021-049,139,"The Court nevertheless holds that States surrendered their sovereign immunity for any congressional causes of action passed pursuant to Article I's Army and Navy Clauses. Ante, at 2465-2467.9 To reach that conclusion, the Court adopts a test that even Torres did not press. Relying exclusively on PennEast, the Court maintains that plan-of-the-Convention waiver distills to a single question: whether the federal power at issue is `complete in itself.' Ante, at 2462-2463 (quoting PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2262). If so, then the States have surrendered their sovereign immunity against any exercises of that power. After framing the inquiry this way, the Court concludes that because Congress' power to build and maintain the Armed Forces is `complete in itself,' States necessarily relinquished their sovereign immunity against private damages actions authorized by that power. Ante, at 2462-2463, 2465-2466.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,140,"In my view, the Court is asking the wrong question. It unjustifiably asserts that the entire plan-of-the-Convention inquiry rests on whether a power is complete in itself. Further, its complete in itself standard misreads PennEast, which suggested only that because the federal eminent domain power was complete in itself and, by its nature, inextricably intertwined with judicial condemnation proceedings, States surrendered any sovereign immunity that would otherwise render the eminent domain power incomplete. PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2260. By saddling completeness with more analytical weight than it can bear, the Court has devised a method that has the certainty and objectivity of a Rorschach test. Beyond its inconsistency with PennEast, this contrivance also threatens to rework or erase the Court's prevailing sovereign immunity jurisprudence.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,142,"The sentence in PennEast upon which the Court fabricates its test for plan-of-the-Convention waiver reads as follows: The federal eminent domain power is `complete in itself,' and the States consented to the exercise of that power—in its entirety—in the plan of the Convention. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2263 (quoting Kohl v. United States, 91 U.S. 367, 374, 23 L.Ed. 449 (1876), citation omitted). The Court today claims that this sentence in PennEast reduced our decadesold State sovereign immunity jurisprudence  to merely asking whether a federal power is complete in itself. That cannot be correct.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,143,"The Court in PennEast borrowed the complete in itself idea from Kohl, which had approved the Federal Government's condemnation of private land to build a post office in Cincinnati, Ohio. 91 U.S. at 373-374. Although the Federal Government had relied on Ohio's eminent domain power, rather than its own, Kohl made clear that the Federal Government's authority to condemn land did not depend upon state law. In doing so, Kohl stated that if the United States have the eminent domain power, it must be complete in itself. Id., at 374. It can neither be enlarged nor diminished by a State. Nor can any State prescribe the manner in which it must be exercised. The consent of a State can never be a condition precedent to its enjoyment. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,144,"Before PennEast, the phrase complete in itself never appeared in our modern state sovereign immunity precedents. PennEast itself invoked the concept for one purpose: to reject the contention that one could separate the eminent domain power from the power to condemn—i.e., to disaggregate those inextricably intertwined powers—when determining whether the history of federal eminent domain supported finding a waiver of state sovereign immunity. 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2260. According to PennEast, to deprive the Federal Government of a power to condemn property in judicial proceedings brought by private delegatees would be tantamount to depriving the Government of part of the eminent domain power itself, contrary to Kohl's characterization of that power as complete in itself. 594 U. S., at ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2260-2261.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,145,"The Court today errs by attributing to Kohl an outsized role in PennEast's sovereign immunity analysis. The Court in PennEast never stated that completeness in itself represented the governing test for plan-of-the-Convention waiver. Likewise, PennEast made no effort to explain how the complete in itself inquiry would work beyond the context of eminent domain. And because PennEast did not invoke Kohl to break new doctrinal ground, the Court made no attempt to reconcile the complete in itself inquiry with this Court's longstanding sovereign immunity precedents (e.g., Alden, Seminole Tribe, Federal Maritime Comm'n, Hans, etc.). Again, if PennEast had made completeness in itself the applicable test, surely the Court would have discussed the concept more thoroughly.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,146,"The Court compounds its overreading of PennEast's complete in itself language by unjustifiably dismissing PennEast's inextricably intertwined rationale as a mere technical aspect of the decision. Ante, at 2467-2468. PennEast is best read to stand for the proposition that, because every federal power must be complete in itself, the States surrendered their sovereign immunity with respect to any federal power that is inextricably intertwined with judicial proceedings, like eminent domain, otherwise, sovereign immunity would excuse the States from the judicial proceeding and the federal power would be incomplete. PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___ - ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2259-2260 (linking completeness of eminent domain power to condemnation proceedings). Yet, now, the Court abandons the only limiting principle in PennEast's test.10  That is mistaken. To begin with, disaggregating the complete in itself standard from PennEast's inextricably intertwined justification renders meaningless the idea of completeness in the context of state sovereign immunity. Consider the Court's opinion here, which says that any federal power complete in itself must be accompanied with a surrender of state sovereign immunity. The Court does not define what it means for a federal power to be complete in itself, except that `the States consented to the exercise of that power—in its entirety—in the plan of the Convention.' Ante, at 2463 (quoting PennEast, 594 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 2263). But that self-referential definition begs the question. If the Court tied the completeness of a federal power to an inherent connection with judicial proceedings, it could give the term independent meaning and make sense of PennEast's actual analysis.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,147,"Worse still, today's decision removes the one important guardrail on the completeness inquiry that PennEast described. Absent that limit, the Court's indefinite test will provide future courts cover to further erode the States' sovereign immunity.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,149,"To the extent that the Court's new complete in itself standard has any definable contours, it is inconsistent with our modern sovereign immunity doctrine and, in particular, Seminole Tribe.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,150,"As I noted above, the Court does not define what it means for a federal power to be complete in itself under PennEast and Kohl. All we are told is that eminent domain and the powers to raise and support armies and navies are powers complete in themselves. See ante, at 2462-2463, 2465-2466.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,151,"The Court's completeness standard is indeterminate in large part because the Court fails to recognize that the concept of a federal power being complete in itself long predates Kohl and means something quite different from what the Court says it does. In fact, the phrase's provenance in our jurisprudence dates back to no less seminal a decision than Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824). There, the Court stated that Congress' power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution, 9 Wheat. at 196 (emphasis added).",Thomas,0,
2021-049,152,"Gibbons' discussion is revealing. First, unlike the Court's decision today, which attempts to cabin congressional powers that are complete in themselves to only a few, Gibbons is explicit that it considered every power vested in Congress to be complete in itself. Ibid. That understanding would explain why Kohl said that if the United States have the power, it must be complete in itself. 91 U.S. at 374 (emphasis added). Second, unlike the Court today, Gibbons defines what it means for a power to be complete in itself—the power may be exercised to its utmost extent with no limitations beyond those in Constitution itself. 9 Wheat. at 196. In other words, the power is plenary as to those subjects to which it applies. See id., at 197.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,153,"Gibbons' understanding of a congressional power being complete in itself was repeated by this Court time and time again for nearly two centuries. Almost always,  the Court used the term to refer to Congress' authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.11 And, over time, the Court confirmed that because Congress' power over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself  it follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110, 119, 62 S.Ct. 523, 86 L.Ed. 726 (1942), see also Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 124, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942). This language echoes Kohl's holding that the federal eminent domain power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by a State. 91 U.S. at 374.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,154,"Ignoring this long history about the very completeness standard that it purports to apply, the Court grasps for some basis to explain how its decision is consistent with this Court's understanding of Congress' commerce power in Seminole Tribe. It asserts that Congress' power under the Army and Navy Clauses is somehow complete in itself while its power under the Commerce Clause is less than complete because federal regulation of commerce (at issue in Seminole Tribe) involves goods that, before they travel between States or outside a tribe, are subject to regulation by a sovereign other than the Federal Government (a State or tribe). Ante, at 2467.",Thomas,0,
2021-049,155,"But the Court's proposed distinction makes no sense. For one, it conflicts with the Court's longstanding characterization of Congress' commerce power as plenary. See, e.g., Armour & Co. v. Virginia, 246 U.S. 1, 6, 38 S.Ct. 267, 62 L.Ed. 547 (1918). As long as the goods mentioned by the Court are in fact part of interstate commerce, then Congress has authority to regulate their travel at all times. For another, it does nothing to distinguish Congress' commerce power from its power to raise and maintain a military. Following the Court's logic, one could just as easily say that Congress' power under the Army and Navy Clauses is less than complete because federal regulation of soldiers involves men and women who, before they join the military, are subject to regulation by a sovereign other than the Federal Government. Despite the Court's efforts, its completeness analysis simply fails to distinguish the Army and Navy Clauses from other Article I powers delegated to Congress in the plan of the Convention.12  Most troubling, however, is the clear parallel between the Court's analysis today and the discredited approach to sovereign immunity that we rejected in Seminole Tribe. For example, in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), the Court relied on Gibbons' complete in itself language to hold that the States surrendered a portion of their sovereignty when they granted Congress the power to regulate commerce. Id., at 191, 84 S.Ct. 1207, see also id., at 192, 84 S.Ct. 1207. Parden reasoned, not unlike the Court today, that the sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution, and that granting Congress plenary power to regulate commerce amounts to a surrender of immunity. Id., at 191, 84 S.Ct. 1207 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Thomas,0,
2021-049,156,"Similarly, in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 2273, 105 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989), the plurality emphasized how it would be difficult to overstate the breadth and depth of the commerce power, id., at 20, 109 S.Ct. 2273, and how the the Commerce Clause with one hand gives power to Congress while, with the other, it takes power away from the States, id., at 16, 109 S.Ct. 2273. In light of this dual grant of federal authority and divestment of state authority, the plurality thought Congress' commerce power would be incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages. Id., at 19, 109 S.Ct. 2273 (emphasis added). To complete that congressional power, the plurality reasoned that to the extent that the States gave Congress the authority to regulate commerce, they also relinquished their immunity where Congress found it necessary, in exercising this authority, to render them liable.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 81a.4 Saada had proposed that he would provide Golan with $30,000 for expenses pending a decision in Italian courts as to financial support, stay away from Golan until the custody dispute was resolved, pursue dismissal of the criminal charges he had filed against Golan, begin cognitive behavioral therapy, and waive any right to legal fees or expenses under the Convention. The court concluded that these measures, combined with the fact that Saada and Golan would be living separately, would reduce the occasions for violence, thereby ameliorating the grave risk to B. A. S. sufficiently to require his return. Id., at 81a-82a.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,44,"On Golan's appeal of this return order, the Second Circuit vacated the order, finding the District Court's measures insufficient to mitigate the risk of harm to B. A. S. Emphasizing that the District Court's factual findings provided ample reason to doubt that Mr. Saada will comply with these conditions, the Second Circuit concluded that the District Court erred in granting the petition subject to (largely) unenforceable undertakings without sufficient guarantees of performance. 930 F.3d 533, 540, 542-543 (2019). Because the record did not support the conclusion that there exist no protective measures sufficient to ameliorate the grave risk of harm  B. A. S. faces if repatriated, the court remanded for the District Court to consider whether there exist alternative ameliorative measures that are either enforceable by the District Court or supported by other sufficient guarantees of performance. Id., at 543 (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,45,"To comply with the Second Circuit's directive, over the course of nine months, the District Court conducted an extensive examination of the measures available to ensure B. A. S.'s safe return to Italy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. The District Court directed the parties to appear for status conferences and to submit status reports and supplemental briefs, and the court corresponded with the U. S. Department of State and the Italian Ministry of Justice. At the court's instruction, the parties petitioned the Italian courts for a protective order, and the Italian court overseeing the underlying custody dispute issued a protective order barring Saada from approaching Golan for one year. In addition, the Italian court ordered that an Italian social services agency oversee Saada's parenting classes and therapy and that visits between Saada and B. A. S. be supervised.5",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,46,"The District Court concluded that these measures were sufficient to ameliorate the harm to B. A. S. and again granted Saada's petition for B. A. S.' return. It rejected Golan's argument that Saada could not be trusted to comply with a court order, expressing confidence in the Italian courts' abilities to enforce the protective order. The District Court additionally ordered Saada to pay Golan $150,000 to facilitate B. A. S.' return to Italy and to cover Golan's and B. A. S.' living costs while they resettled. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the District Court did not clearly err in determining that Saada likely would comply with the Italian protective order, given his compliance with other court orders and the threat of enforcement by Italian authorities of its order. 833 Fed. Appx. 829 (2020).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,47,"This Court granted certiorari to decide whether the Second Circuit properly required the District Court, after making a grave-risk finding, to examine a full range of possible ameliorative measures before reaching a decision as to whether to deny return, and to resolve a division in the lower courts regarding whether ameliorative measures must be considered after a grave-risk finding.6 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 638, 211 L.Ed.2d 397 (2021).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,50,"The interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text. Abbott, 560 U.S. at 10, 130 S.Ct. 1983 (internal quotation marks omitted). As described above, when a child has been wrongfully removed or retained from his country of habitual residence, Article 12 of the Hague Convention generally requires the deciding authority (here, a district court) to order the return of the child. Treaty Doc., at 9. Under Article 13(b) of the Convention, however, a court is not bound to order the return of the child if the court finds that the party opposing return has established that return  would expose the child to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm. Id., at 10, 130 S.Ct. 1983. By providing that a court is not bound to order return upon making a grave-risk finding, Article 13(b) lifts the Convention's return requirement, leaving a court with the discretion to grant or deny return.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,51,"Nothing in the Convention's text either forbids or requires consideration of ameliorative measures in exercising this discretion. The Convention itself nowhere mentions ameliorative measures. Nor does ICARA, which, as relevant, instructs courts to decide the case in accordance with the Convention and accordingly leaves undisturbed the discretion recognized in the Convention. 22 U.S.C. § 9003(d). The longstanding interpretation of the Department of State offers further support for the view that the Convention vests a court with discretion to determine whether to order return if an exception to the return mandate applies. See 51 Fed. Reg. 10510 (1986) (explaining that a court in its discretion need not order a child returned upon a finding of grave risk), see also Abbott, 560 U.S. at 15, 130 S.Ct. 1983 (explaining that the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Convention is entitled to great weight (internal quotation marks omitted)).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,52,"Unable to point to any explicit textual mandate that courts consider ameliorative measures, Saada's primary argument is that this requirement is implicit in the Convention's command that the court make a determination as to whether a grave risk of harm exists. Essentially, Saada argues that determining whether a grave risk of harm exists necessarily requires considering whether any ameliorative measures are available.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,53,"The question whether there is a grave risk, however, is separate from the question whether there are ameliorative measures that could mitigate that risk. That said, the question whether ameliorative measures would be appropriate or effective will often overlap considerably with the inquiry into whether a grave risk exists. See Simcox v. Simcox, 511 F.3d 594, 607-608 (C.A.6 2007) (explaining that the appropriateness and utility of ameliorative measures correlate with the gravity of the risk to the child). In many instances, a court may find it appropriate to consider both questions at once. For example, a finding of grave risk as to a part of a country where an epidemic rages may naturally lead a court simultaneously to consider whether return to another part of the country is feasible. The fact that a court may consider ameliorative measures concurrent with the grave-risk determination, however, does not mean that the Convention imposes a categorical requirement on a court to consider any or all ameliorative measures before denying return once it finds that a grave risk exists.7  Under the Convention and ICARA, district courts' discretion to determine whether to return a child where doing so would pose a grave risk to the child includes the discretion whether to consider ameliorative measures that could ensure the child's safe return. The Second Circuit's rule, in practice, rewrites the treaty, Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.S. 1, 17, 134 S.Ct. 1224, 188 L.Ed.2d 200 (2014), by imposing an atextual, categorical requirement that courts consider all possible ameliorative measures in exercising this discretion, regardless of whether such consideration is consistent with the Convention's objectives (and, seemingly, regardless of whether the parties offered them for the court's consideration in the first place). See Blondin I, 189 F.3d at 249 (requiring district court not to limit itself to the single alternative placement initially suggested by the appellant but instead affirmatively to develop a thorough record to facilitate its decision, including by making any appropriate or necessary inquiries of the government of the country of habitual residence and invoking the aid of the Department of State).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,55,"While consideration of ameliorative measures is within a district court's discretion, discretion is not whim. Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 139, 126 S.Ct. 704, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005). A motion to a court's discretion is a motion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment, and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles. Ibid. (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). As a threshold matter, a district court exercising its discretion is still responsible for addressing and responding to nonfrivolous arguments timely raised by the parties before it. While a district court has no obligation under the Convention to consider ameliorative measures that have not been raised by the parties, it ordinarily should address ameliorative measures raised by the parties or obviously suggested by the circumstances of the case, such as in the example of the localized epidemic. See supra, at 1892-1893.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,56,"In addition, the court's consideration of ameliorative measures must be guided by the legal principles and other requirements set forth in the Convention and ICARA. The Second Circuit's rule, by instructing district courts to order return if at all possible, improperly elevated return above the Convention's other objectives. Blondin I, 189 F.3d at 248. The Convention does not pursue return exclusively or at all costs. Rather, the Convention is designed to protect the interests of children and their parents, Lozano, 572 U.S. at 19, 134 S.Ct. 1224 (ALITO, J., concurring), and children's interests may point against return in some circumstances. Courts must remain conscious of this purpose, as well as the Convention's other objectives and requirements, which constrain courts' discretion to consider ameliorative measures in at least three ways.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,57,"First, any consideration of ameliorative measures must prioritize the child's physical and psychological safety. The Convention explicitly recognizes that the child's interest in avoiding physical or psychological harm, in addition to other interests, may overcome the return remedy. Id., at 16, 134 S.Ct. 1224 (majority opinion) (cataloging interests).8 A court  may therefore decline to consider imposing ameliorative measures where it is clear that they would not work because the risk is so grave. Sexual abuse of a child is one example of an intolerable situation. See 51 Fed. Reg. 10510. Other physical or psychological abuse, serious neglect, and domestic violence in the home may also constitute an obvious grave risk to the child's safety that could not readily be ameliorated. A court may also decline to consider imposing ameliorative measures where it reasonably expects that they will not be followed. See, e.g., Walsh v. Walsh, 221 F.3d 204, 221 (C.A.1 2000) (providing example of parent with history of violating court orders).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,58,"Second, consideration of ameliorative measures should abide by the Convention's requirement that courts addressing return petitions do not usurp the role of the court that will adjudicate the underlying custody dispute. The Convention and ICARA prohibit courts from resolving any underlying custody dispute in adjudicating a return petition. See Art. 16, Treaty Doc., at 10, 22 U.S.C. § 9001(b)(4). Accordingly, a court ordering ameliorative measures in making a return determination should limit those measures in time and scope to conditions that would permit safe return, without purporting to decide subsequent custody matters or weighing in on permanent arrangements.9",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,59,"Third, any consideration of ameliorative measures must accord with the Convention's requirement that courts act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children. Art. 11, Treaty Doc., at 9.10 Timely resolution of return petitions is important in part because return is a provisional remedy to enable final custody determinations to proceed. Monasky, 589 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 723 (internal  quotation marks omitted). The Convention also prioritizes expeditious determinations as being in the best interests of the child because expedition will help minimize the extent to which uncertainty adds to the challenges confronting both parents and child. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 180, 133 S.Ct. 1017, 185 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013). A requirement to examine the full range of options that might make possible the safe return of a child, Blondin II, 238 F.3d at 163, n. 11, is in tension with this focus on expeditious resolution. In this case, for example, it took the District Court nine months to comply with the Second Circuit's directive on remand. Remember, the Convention requires courts to resolve return petitions using the most expeditious procedures available, Art. 2, Treaty Doc., at 7, and to provide parties that request it with an explanation if proceedings extend longer than six weeks, Art. 11, id., at 9. Courts should structure return proceedings with these instructions in mind. Consideration of ameliorative measures should not cause undue delay in resolution of return petitions.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,60,"To summarize, although nothing in the Convention prohibits a district court from considering ameliorative measures, and such consideration often may be appropriate, a district court reasonably may decline to consider ameliorative measures that have not been raised by the parties, are unworkable, draw the court into determinations properly resolved in custodial proceedings, or risk overly prolonging return proceedings. The court may also find the grave risk so unequivocal, or the potential harm so severe, that ameliorative measures would be inappropriate. Ultimately, a district court must exercise its discretion to consider ameliorative measures in a manner consistent with its general obligation to address the parties' substantive arguments and its specific obligations under the Convention. A district court's compliance with these requirements is subject to review under an ordinary abuse-of-discretion standard.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,62,"The question now becomes how to resolve the instant case. Golan urges that this Court reverse, arguing that the ameliorative measures adopted by the District Court are inadequate for B. A. S.' protection and otherwise improper. The United States, as amicus curiae, suggests remanding to allow the District Court to exercise its discretion in the first instance under the correct legal standard. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,63,"Under the circumstances of this case, this Court concludes that remand is appropriate. The Convention requires courts to make a discretionary determination as to whether to order return after making a finding of grave risk. The District Court made a finding of grave risk, but never had the opportunity to engage in the discretionary inquiry as to whether to order or deny return under the correct legal standard. This Court cannot know whether the District Court would have exercised its discretion to order B. A. S.' return absent the Second Circuit's rule, which improperly weighted the scales in favor of return. Accordingly, it is appropriate to follow the ordinary course and allow the District Court to apply the proper legal standard in the first instance. Cf. Monasky, 589 U. S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 731 (declining to follow the ordinary course of ordering remand where the determination in question was nondiscretionary and there was no reason to anticipate that the District Court's judgment would change on a remand).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-051,64,"Remand will as a matter of course add further delay to a proceeding that has already spanned years longer than it should have. The delay that has already occurred, however, cannot be undone. This  Court trusts that the District Court will move as expeditiously as possible to reach a final decision without further unnecessary delay. The District Court has ample evidence before it from the prior proceedings and has made extensive factual findings concerning the risks at issue. Golan argues that the ameliorative measures ordered intrude too greatly on custodial determinations and that they are inadequate to protect B. A. S.' safety given the District Court's findings that Saada is unable to control or take responsibility for his behavior. The District Court should determine whether the measures in question are adequate to order return in light of its factual findings concerning the risk to B. A. S., bearing in mind that the Convention sets as a primary goal the safety of the child.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

Cal. Lab. Code Ann. § 2698 et seq. (West 2022).",Alito,0,
2021-053,32,"The California Legislature enacted the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) to address a perceived deficit in the enforcement of the State's Labor Code. California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) had the authority to bring enforcement actions to impose civil penalties on employers for violations of many of the code's provisions. But the legislature believed the LWDA did not have sufficient resources to reach the  appropriate level of compliance, and budgetary constraints made it impossible to achieve an adequate level of financing. The legislature thus decided to enlist employees as private attorneys general to enforce California labor law, with the understanding that labor-law enforcement agencies were to retain primacy over private enforcement efforts.",Alito,0,
2021-053,33,"By its terms, PAGA authorizes any aggrieved employee to initiate an action against a former employer on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees to obtain civil penalties that previously could have been recovered only by the State in an LWDA enforcement action. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. § 2699(a). As the text of the statute indicates, PAGA limits statutory standing to aggrieved employees—a term defined to include any person who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed. § 2699(c). To bring suit, however, an employee must also exhaust administrative remedies. That entails providing notice to the employer and the LWDA of the violations alleged and the supporting facts and theories. § 2699.3(a)(1)(A). If the LWDA fails to respond or initiate an investigation within a specified timeframe, the employee may bring suit. § 2699.3(a)(2). In any successful PAGA action, the LWDA is entitled to 75 percent of the award. § 2699(i). The remaining 25 percent is distributed among the employees affected by the violations at issue.

Although the statute's language suggests that an aggrieved employee sues on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees, § 2699(a), California precedent holds that a PAGA suit is a `representative action' in which the employee plaintiff sues as an `agent or proxy' of the State. Id., at 380, 173 Cal.Rptr.3d 289, 327 P.3d at 147 (quoting Arias v. Superior Court, 46 Cal.4th 969, 986, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 209 P.3d 923, 933 (2009)).",Alito,0,

In other words, the statute gives employees a right to assert the State's claims for civil penalties on a representative basis, but it does not create any private rights or private claims for relief.

Iskanian, 59 Cal.4th at 381, 173 Cal.Rptr.3d 289, 327 P.3d at 147. Other, distinct provisions of the code create individual rights, and claims arising from violations of those rights are actionable through separate private causes of action for compensatory or statutory damages.

2021-053,36,"California precedent also interprets the statute to contain what is effectively a rule of claim joinder. Rules of claim joinder allow a party to unite multiple claims against an opposing party in a single action. See 6A C. Wright, H. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1582 (3d ed. 2016) (Wright & Miller). PAGA standing has the same function. An employee with statutory standing may seek any civil penalties the state can, including penalties for violations involving employees other than the PAGA litigant herself. ZB, N. A. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal.5th 175, 185, 252 Cal.Rptr.3d 228, 448 P.3d 239, 243-244 (2019). An employee who alleges he or she suffered a single violation is entitled to use that violation as a gateway to assert a potentially limitless number of other violations as predicates for liability. This mechanism radically expands the scope of PAGA actions. The default penalties set by PAGA are $100 for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and $200 for each aggrieved employee per pay period for each subsequent violation. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. § 2699(f)(2). Individually, these penalties are modest, but given PAGA's additive dimension, low-value claims may easily be welded together into high-value suits.",Alito,0,
2021-053,38,"Petitioner Viking River Cruises, Inc. (Viking), is a company that offers ocean and river cruises around the world. When respondent Angie Moriana was hired by  Viking as a sales representative, she executed an agreement to arbitrate any dispute arising out of her employment. The agreement contained a Class Action Waiver providing that in any arbitral proceeding, the parties could not bring any dispute as a class, collective, or representative PAGA action. It also contained a severability clause specifying that if the waiver was found invalid, any class, collective, representative, or PAGA action would presumptively be litigated in court. But under that severability clause, if any portion of the waiver remained valid, it would be enforced in arbitration.",Alito,0,
2021-053,39,"After leaving her position with Viking, Moriana filed a PAGA action against Viking in California court. Her complaint contained a claim that Viking had failed to provide her with her final wages within 72 hours, as required by §§ 101-102 of the California Labor Code. But the complaint also asserted a wide array of other code violations allegedly sustained by other Viking employees, including violations of provisions concerning the minimum wage, overtime, meal periods, rest periods, timing of pay, and pay statements. Viking moved to compel arbitration of Moriana's individual PAGA claim—here meaning the claim that arose from the violation she suffered—and to dismiss her other PAGA claims. The trial court denied that motion, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that categorical waivers of PAGA standing are contrary to state policy and that PAGA claims cannot be split into arbitrable individual claims and nonarbitrable representative claims.",Alito,0,
2021-053,40,"This ruling was dictated by the California Supreme Court's decision in Iskanian. In that case, the court held that pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to bring representative PAGA claims are invalid as a matter of public policy. What, precisely, this holding means requires some explanation. PAGA's unique features have prompted the development of an entire vocabulary unique to the statute, but the details, it seems, are still being worked out. An unfortunate feature of this lexicon is that it tends to use the word representative in two distinct ways, and each of those uses of the term representative is connected with one of Iskanian's rules governing contractual waiver of PAGA claims.",Alito,0,
2021-053,41,"In the first sense, PAGA actions are representative in that they are brought by employees acting as representatives— that is, as agents or proxies—of the State. But PAGA claims are also called representative when they are predicated on code violations sustained by other employees. In the first sense, `every PAGA action is  representative' and there is no individual component to a PAGA action, Kim, 9 Cal.5th at 87, 259 Cal. Rptr.3d 769, 259 Cal.Rptr.3d, 459 P.3d at 1131 (quoting Iskanian, 59 Cal.4th at 387, 173 Cal.Rptr.3d 289, 327 P.3d at 151), because every PAGA claim is asserted in a representative capacity. But when the word representative is used in the second way, it makes sense to distinguish individual PAGA claims, which are premised on Labor Code violations actually sustained by the plaintiff, from representative (or perhaps quasi-representative) PAGA claims arising out of events involving other employees. For purposes of this opinion, we will use individual PAGA claim to refer to claims based on code violations suffered by the plaintiff. And we will endeavor to be clear about how we are using the term representative.",Alito,0,
2021-053,42,"Iskanian's principal rule prohibits waivers of representative PAGA claims in the first sense. That is, it prevents parties from waiving representative standing to bring PAGA claims in a judicial or arbitral forum. But Iskanian also adopted a secondary  rule that invalidates agreements to separately arbitrate or litigate individual PAGA claims for Labor Code violations that an employee suffered, on the theory that resolving victim-specific claims in separate arbitrations does not serve the deterrent purpose of PAGA. 59 Cal.4th at 383, 173 Cal.Rptr.3d 289, 327 P.3d at 149, see also Kim, 9 Cal.5th at 88, 259 Cal.Rptr.3d 769, 259 Cal.Rptr.3d, 459 P.3d at 1132 (noting that based on Iskanian, California courts have uniformly rejected efforts to split PAGA claims into individual and representative components).",Alito,0,
2021-053,43,"In this case, Iskanian's principal prohibition required the lower courts to treat the representative-action waiver in the agreement between Moriana and Viking as invalid insofar as it was construed as a wholesale waiver of PAGA standing. The agreement's severability clause, however, allowed enforcement of any portion of the waiver that remained valid, so the agreement still would have permitted arbitration of Moriana's individual PAGA claim even if wholesale enforcement was impossible. But because California law prohibits division of a PAGA action into constituent claims, the state courts refused to compel arbitration of that claim as well.

Section 2 of the statute makes arbitration agreements valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. 9 U.S.C. § 2.3 As we have interpreted it, this provision contains two clauses: An enforcement mandate, which renders agreements to arbitrate enforceable as a matter of federal law, and a saving clause, which permits invalidation of arbitration clauses on grounds applicable to any contract.

That right would not be a right to arbitrate in any meaningful sense if generally applicable principles of state law could be used to transform traditional individualized  arbitration into the litigation it was meant to displace through the imposition of procedures at odds with arbitration's informal nature. Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1623. See also Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 351, 131 S.Ct. 1740. And that right would not be a right to arbitrate based on an agreement if generally applicable law could be used to coercively impose arbitration in contravention of the first principle of our FAA jurisprudence: that arbitration is strictly `a matter of consent.'

2021-053,47,"Based on these principles, we have held that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.

Id., at 347, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 686, 130 S.Ct. 1758). As a result, class procedures cannot be imposed by state law without presenting unwilling parties with an unacceptable choice between being compelled to arbitrate using procedures at odds with arbitration's traditional form and forgoing arbitration altogether. Putting parties to that choice is inconsistent with the FAA.",Alito,0,
2021-053,48,"Viking contends that these decisions require enforcement of contractual provisions waiving the right to bring PAGA actions because PAGA creates a form of class or collective proceeding. If this is correct, Iskanian's prohibition on PAGA waivers presents parties with the same impermissible choice as the rules we have invalidated in our decisions concerning class- and collective-action waivers: Either arbitrate disputes using a form of class procedure, or do not arbitrate at all.",Alito,0,
2021-053,49,"Moriana offers a very different characterization of the statute. As she sees it, any conflict between Iskanian and the FAA is illusory because PAGA creates nothing more than a substantive cause of action. The only thing that is distinctive about PAGA, she supposes, is that it allows employee plaintiffs to increase the available penalties that may be awarded in an action by proving additional predicate violations of the Labor Code. But that does not make a PAGA action a class action, because those violations are not distinct claims belonging to distinct individuals. Instead, they are predicates for expanded liability under a single cause of action. In Moriana's view, that means Iskanianinvalidates waivers of substantive rights, and does not purport to invalidate anything  that can meaningfully be described as an arbitration agreement.4",Alito,0,
2021-053,50,"We disagree with both characterizations of the statute. Moriana is correct that the FAA does not require courts to enforce contractual waivers of substantive rights and remedies. The FAA's mandate is to enforce arbitration agreements. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 344, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (emphasis added). And as we have described it, an arbitration agreement is a specialized kind of forum-selection clause that posits not only the situs of suit but also the procedure to be used in resolving the dispute. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 519, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974), Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 633, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). An arbitration agreement thus does not alter or abridge substantive rights, it merely changes how those rights will be processed. And so we have said that `by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute, it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral  forum.' Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346, 359, 128 S.Ct. 978, 169 L.Ed.2d 917 (2008) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U.S. at 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346).5",Alito,0,
2021-053,51,"But Moriana's premise that PAGA creates a unitary private cause of action is irreconcilable with the structure of the statute and the ordinary legal meaning of the word claim. California courts interpret PAGA to provide employees with delegated authority to assert the State's claims on a representative basis, not an individual cause of action. See, e.g., Amalgamated Transit, 46 Cal.4th at 1003, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d 605, 209 P.3d at 943 (PAGA is simply a procedural statute that does not create property rights or any other substantive rights). And a PAGA action asserting multiple code violations affecting a range of different employees does not constitute a single claim in even the broadest possible sense, because the violations  asserted need not even arise from a common transaction or nucleus of operative facts. Lucky Brand Dungarees, Inc. v. Marcel Fashions Group, Inc., 590 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1589, 1595, 206 L.Ed.2d 893 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).6",Alito,0,
2021-053,52,"Viking's position, on the other hand, elides important structural differences between PAGA actions and class actions that preclude any straightforward application of our precedents invalidating prohibitions on class-action waivers. Class-action procedure allows courts to use a representative plaintiff's individual claims as a basis to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate suits, Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408, 130 S.Ct. 1431, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010). This, of course, requires the certification of a class. And because class judgments bind absentees with respect to their individual claims for relief and are preclusive as to all claims the class could have brought, Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867, 874, 104 S.Ct. 2794, 81 L.Ed.2d 718 (1984), class representatives must at all times adequately represent absent class members, and absent class members must be afforded notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a right to opt out of the class. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 349, 131 S.Ct. 1740. And to ensure that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class whose claims they wish to litigate, the adjudicator must decide questions of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011).",Alito,0,
2021-053,53,"PAGA actions also permit the adjudication of multiple claims in a single suit, but their structure is entirely different. A class-action plaintiff can raise a multitude of claims because he or she represents a multitude of absent individuals, a PAGA plaintiff, by contrast, represents a single principal, the LWDA, that has a multitude of claims. As a result of this structural difference, PAGA suits exhibit virtually none of the procedural characteristics of class actions. The plaintiff does not represent a class of injured individuals, so there is no need for certification. PAGA judgments are binding only with respect to the State's claims, and are not binding on nonparty employees as to any individually held claims. Arias, 46 Cal.4th at 986, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 209 P.3d at 933-934. This obviates the need to consider adequacy of representation, numerosity, commonality, or typicality. And although the statute gives other affected employees a future interest in the penalties awarded in an action, that interest does not make those employees parties in any of the senses in which absent class members are, see Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 122 S.Ct. 2005, 153 L.Ed.2d 27 (2002), or give those employees anything more than an inchoate interest in litigation proceeds. See Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 773, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000) (The `right' to a share of the proceeds of a qui tam action does not even fully  materialize until the litigation is completed and the relator prevails).",Alito,0,
2021-053,54,"Because PAGA actions do not adjudicate the individual claims of multiple absent third parties, they do not present the problems of notice, due process, and adequacy of representation that render class arbitration inconsistent with arbitration's traditionally individualized form. See Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 347-348, 131 S.Ct. 1740. Of course, as a practical matter, PAGA actions do have something important in common with class actions. Because PAGA plaintiffs represent a principal with a potentially vast number of claims at its disposal, PAGA suits greatly increase risks to defendants. Id., at 350, 131 S.Ct. 1740. But our precedents do not hold that the FAA allows parties to contract out of anything that might amplify defense risks. Instead, our cases hold that States cannot coerce individuals into forgoing arbitration by taking the individualized and informal procedures characteristic of traditional arbitration off the table. Litigation risks are relevant to that inquiry because one way in which state law may coerce parties into forgoing their right to arbitrate is by conditioning that right on the use of a procedural format that makes arbitration artificially unattractive. The question, then, is whether PAGA contains any procedural mechanism at odds with arbitration's basic form.",Alito,0,
2021-053,55,"Viking suggests an answer. Our FAA precedents treat bilateral arbitration as the prototype of the individualized and informal form of arbitration protected from undue state interference by the FAA. See Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1622-1624, see also American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 570 U.S. 228, 238, 133 S.Ct. 2304, 186 L.Ed.2d 417 (2013), Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 347-349, 131 S.Ct. 1740, Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 685-686, 130 S.Ct. 1758. Viking posits that a proceeding is bilateral in the relevant sense if—but only if—it involves two and only two parties and the arbitration `is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.' Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 348, 131 S.Ct. 2541 (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-701, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979)). PAGA actions necessarily deviate from this ideal because they involve litigation or arbitration on behalf of an absent principal. Viking thus suggests that Iskanian's prohibition on PAGA waivers is inconsistent with the FAA because PAGA creates an intrinsically representational form of action and Iskanian requires parties either to arbitrate in that format or forgo arbitration altogether.",Alito,0,
2021-053,56,"We disagree. Nothing in the FAA establishes a categorical rule mandating enforcement of waivers of standing to assert claims on behalf of absent principals. Non-class representative actions in which a single agent litigates on behalf of a single principal are part of the basic architecture of much of substantive law. Familiar examples include shareholder-derivative suits, wrongful-death actions, trustee actions, and suits on behalf of infants or incompetent persons. Single-agent, single-principal suits of this kind necessarily deviate from the strict ideal of bilateral dispute resolution posited by Viking. But we have never held that the FAA imposes a duty on States to render all forms of representative standing waivable by contract. Nor have we suggested that single-agent, single-principal representative suits are inconsistent the norm of bilateral arbitration as our precedents conceive of it. Instead, we have held that the `changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration' are too fundamental to be imposed on parties without their consent. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 347-348, 131 S.Ct. 1740 (quoting  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 686, 130 S.Ct. 1758, emphasis added). And we have held that § 2's saving clause does not preserve defenses that would allow a party to declare that a contract is unenforceable just because it requires bilateral arbitration. Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1623.",Alito,0,
2021-053,57,"These principles do not mandate the enforcement of waivers of representative capacity as a categorical rule. Requiring parties to decide whether to arbitrate or litigate a single-agent, single-principal action does not produce a shift from a situation in which the arbitrator must resolve a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement to one in which he or she must resolve many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties. Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 686, 130 S.Ct. 1758. And a proceeding in which two and only two parties arbitrate exclusively in their individual capacities is not the only thing one might mean by bilateral arbitration. As we have said, the label `party' does not indicate an absolute characteristic, but rather a conclusion about the applicability of various procedural rules that may differ based on context. Devlin, 536 U.S. at 10, 122 S.Ct. 2005. Our precedents use the phrase bilateral arbitration in opposition to class or collective arbitration, and the problems we have identified in mandatory class arbitration arise from procedures characteristic of multiparty representative actions. Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1632, see also Italian Colors, 570 U.S., at 238, 133 S.Ct. 2304, Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 347-349, 131 S.Ct. 1740, Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 685-686, 130 S.Ct. 1758. Unlike these kinds of actions, single-principal, single-agent representative actions are bilateral in two registers: They involve the rights of only the absent real party in interest and the defendant, and litigation need only be conducted by the agent-plaintiff and the defendant. This degree of deviation from bilateral norms is not alien to traditional arbitral practice,7 and our precedents have never suggested otherwise. See, e.g., Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. 530, 132 S.Ct. 1201, 182 L.Ed.2d 42 (2012) (per curiam) (invalidating rule categorically barring arbitration of wrongful-death actions).",Alito,0,
2021-053,58,"Nor does a rule prohibiting waiver of representative standing declare that a contract is unenforceable just because it requires bilateral arbitration. Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1623. Indeed, if the term bilateral arbitration is used to mean arbitration in an individual capacity between precisely two parties, a rule prohibiting representative-capacity waivers cannot invalidate agreements to arbitrate on a bilateral basis. An agreement that explicitly provided for arbitration on a strictly bilateral basis would, under that definition of the term bilateral, categorically exclude representative-capacity claims from its coverage. Such claims, after all, necessarily involve the representation of an absent principal, and thus cannot be arbitrated in a strictly bilateral proceeding. A rule prohibiting waivers of representative standing would not invalidate any agreements that contracted for bilateral arbitration in Viking's sense—it would simply require parties to choose whether to litigate those claims or  arbitrate them in a proceeding that is not bilateral in every conceivable sense. And while this consequence only follows because it is impossible to decide representative claims in an arbitration that is bilateral in every dimension, nothing in our precedent suggests that in enacting the FAA, Congress intended to require States to reshape their agency law to ensure that parties will never have to arbitrate in a proceeding that deviates from bilateral arbitration in the strictest sense. If there is a conflict between California's prohibition on PAGA waivers and the FAA, it must derive from a different source.",Alito,0,
2021-053,60,"We think that such a conflict between PAGA's procedural structure and the FAA does exist, and that it derives from the statute's built-in mechanism of claim joinder. As we noted at the outset, that mechanism permits aggrieved employees to use the Labor Code violations they personally suffered as a basis to join to the action any claims that could have been raised by the State in an enforcement proceeding. Iskanian's secondary rule prohibits parties from contracting around this joinder device because it invalidates agreements to arbitrate only individual PAGA claims for Labor Code violations that an employee suffered, 59 Cal.4th at 383, 173 Cal. Rptr.3d 289, 327 P.3d at 149.",Alito,0,
2021-053,61,"This prohibition on contractual division of PAGA actions into constituent claims unduly circumscribes the freedom of parties to determine the issues subject to arbitration and the rules by which they will arbitrate, Lamps Plus, 587 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1416, and does so in a way that violates the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of consent, Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 684, 130 S.Ct. 1758. The most basic corollary of the principle that arbitration is a matter of consent is that a party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration, First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 945, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). This means that parties cannot be coerced into arbitrating a claim, issue, or dispute absent an affirmative `contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.' Lamps Plus, 587 U.S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1416 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 684, 130 S.Ct. 1758), see also Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 347-348, 131 S.Ct. 1740.",Alito,0,
2021-053,62,"For that reason, state law cannot condition the enforceability of an arbitration agreement on the availability of a procedural mechanism that would permit a party to expand the scope of the arbitration by introducing claims that the parties did not jointly agree to arbitrate. Rules of claim joinder can function in precisely that way. Modern civil procedure dispenses with the formalities of the common-law approach to claim joinder in favor of almost-unqualified joinder. Wright & Miller § 1581. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 18(a), which permits a party to join, as independent or alternative claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party, is typical of the modern approach. But the FAA licenses contracting parties to depart from standard rules in favor of individualized arbitration procedures of their own design, so parties to an arbitration agreement are not required to follow the same approach. Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1626. And that is true even if bifurcated proceedings are an inevitable result. See, e.g., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 220-221, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985), Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).",Alito,0,
2021-053,63,"A state rule imposing an expansive rule of joinder in the arbitral context would defeat the ability of parties to control which claims are subject to arbitration. Such a rule would permit parties to superadd new claims to the proceeding, regardless of whether the agreement between them committed those claims to arbitration. Requiring arbitration procedures to include a joinder rule of that kind compels parties to either go along with an arbitration in which the range of issues under consideration is determined by coercion rather than consent, or else forgo arbitration altogether. Either way, the parties are coerced into giving up a right they enjoy under the FAA. See Lamps Plus, 587 U.S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1415-1416, Epic Systems, 584 U.S., at ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct., at 1621-1624, Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 347-351, 131 S.Ct. 1740, Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 684-687, 130 S.Ct. 1758.",Alito,0,
2021-053,64,"When made compulsory by way of Iskanian, the joinder rule internal to PAGA functions in exactly this way. Under that rule, parties cannot agree to restrict the scope of an arbitration to disputes arising out of a particular `transaction' or `common nucleus of facts.' Lucky Brand, 590 U.S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1595. If the parties agree to arbitrate individual PAGA claims based on personally sustained violations, Iskanian allows the aggrieved employee to abrogate that agreement after the fact and demand either judicial proceedings or an arbitral proceeding that exceeds the scope jointly intended by the parties. The only way for parties to agree to arbitrate one of an employee's PAGA claims is to also agree to arbitrate all other PAGA claims in the same arbitral proceeding.",Alito,0,
2021-053,65,"The effect of Iskanian's rule mandating this mechanism is to coerce parties into withholding PAGA claims from arbitration. Liberal rules of claim joinder presuppose a backdrop in which litigants assert their own claims and those of a limited class of other parties who are usually connected with the plaintiff by virtue of a distinctive legal relationship—such as that between shareholders and a corporation or between a parent and a minor child. PAGA departs from that norm by granting the power to enforce a subset of California public law to every employee in the State. This combination of standing to act on behalf of a sovereign and mandatory freeform joinder allows plaintiffs to unite a massive number of claims in a single-package suit. But as we have said, arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of massive-scale disputes of this kind. Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 350, 131 S.Ct. 1740. The absence of multilayered review in arbitral proceedings makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected. Ibid. And suits featuring a vast number of claims entail the same risk of `in terrorem' settlements that class actions entail. Ibid. As a result, Iskanian's indivisibility rule effectively coerces parties to opt for a judicial forum rather than forgoing the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution. Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 685, 130 S.Ct. 1758, see also Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 350-351, 131 S.Ct. 1740. This result is incompatible with the FAA.",Alito,0,
2021-053,67,"We hold that the FAA preempts the rule of Iskanian insofar as it precludes division of PAGA actions into individual and non-individual claims through an agreement to arbitrate. This holding compels reversal in this case. The agreement between Viking and Moriana purported to waive representative PAGA claims. Under Iskanian, this provision was invalid if construed as a wholesale waiver of PAGA claims. And under our holding, that aspect  of Iskanian is not preempted by the FAA, so the agreement remains invalid insofar as it is interpreted in that manner. But the severability clause in the agreement provides that if the waiver provision is invalid in some respect, any portion of the waiver that remains valid must still be enforced in arbitration. Based on this clause, Viking was entitled to enforce the agreement insofar as it mandated arbitration of Moriana's individual PAGA claim. The lower courts refused to do so based on the rule that PAGA actions cannot be divided into individual and non-individual claims. Under our holding, that rule is preempted, so Viking is entitled to compel arbitration of Moriana's individual claim.",Alito,0,
2021-053,68,"The remaining question is what the lower courts should have done with Moriana's non-individual claims. Under our holding in this case, those claims may not be dismissed simply because they are representative. Iskanian's rule remains valid to that extent. But as we see it, PAGA provides no mechanism to enable a court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims once an individual claim has been committed to a separate proceeding. Under PAGA's standing requirement, a plaintiff can maintain non-individual PAGA claims in an action only by virtue of also maintaining an individual claim in that action. See Cal. Lab. Code Ann. §§ 2699(a), (c). When an employee's own dispute is pared away from a PAGA action, the employee is no different from a member of the general public, and PAGA does not allow such persons to maintain suit. See Kim, 9 Cal.5th at 90, 259 Cal.Rptr.3d 769, 259 Cal.Rptr.3d, 459 P.3d at 1133 (PAGA's standing requirement was meant to be a departure from the `general public'  standing originally allowed under other California statutes). As a result, Moriana lacks statutory standing to continue to maintain her non-individual claims in court, and the correct course is to dismiss her remaining claims.",Alito,0,

Ante, at 1924. In its analysis of the parties' contentions, the Court also details several important limitations on the pre-emptive effect of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).

Thus, the Court reasons, based on available guidance from California courts, that Moriana lacks statutory standing under PAGA to litigate her non-individual claims separately in state court. Ibid. Of course, if this Court's understanding of state law is wrong, California courts, in an appropriate case, will have the last word.

Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011), Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 1612, 200 L.Ed.2d 889 (2018), Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1407, 203 L.Ed.2d 636 (2019). I would say nothing more than that. The discussion in Parts II and IV of the Court's opinion is unnecessary to the result, and much of it addresses disputed state-law questions as well as arguments not pressed or passed upon in this case.*",Barrett,0,

2021-053,77,"I continue to adhere to the view that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., does not apply to proceedings in state courts. See Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.

Accordingly, the FAA does not require California's courts to enforce an arbitration agreement that forbids an employee to invoke the State's Private Attorneys General Act. On that basis, I would affirm the judgment of the California Court of Appeal.",Thomas,0,
2021-056,31,"At the heart of this lawsuit lies a challenge to the constitutionality of a North Carolina election law. But the merits of that dispute are not before us, only an antecedent question of civil procedure: Are two leaders of North Carolina's state legislature entitled to participate in the case under the terms of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2)?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,34,"Within wide constitutional bounds, States are free to structure themselves as they wish. Often, they choose to conduct their affairs through a variety of branches, agencies, and elected and appointed officials. These constituent pieces sometimes work together to achieve shared goals, other times they reach very different judgments about important policy questions and act accordingly. This diffusion of governmental powers within and across institutions may be an everyday feature of American life. But it can also pose its difficulties when a State's laws or policies are challenged in federal court.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,35,"Suppose someone seeks to attack a state law on the ground that it is inconsistent with the Federal Constitution. Generally, States themselves are immune from suit in federal court. See Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 284, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011). So usually a plaintiff will sue the individual state officials most responsible for enforcing the law in question and seek injunctive or declaratory relief against them. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Despite the artifice, of course, a State will as a practical matter often retain a strong interest in this kind of litigation. After all, however captioned, a suit of this sort can implicate the continued enforceability of the State's own statutes. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986). To defend its practical interests, the State may choose to mount a legal defense of the named official defendants and speak with a single voice, often through an attorney general. Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill, 587 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1945, 1952, 204 L.Ed.2d 305 (2019).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,36,"Still, not every State has structured itself this way. Some have chosen to authorize multiple officials to defend their practical interests in cases like these. See ibid. North Carolina falls into this camp. The State's attorney general wields some authority to represent individual official defendants in federal litigation. See Martin v. Thornburg, 320 N.C. 533, 545-546, 359 S.E.2d 472, 479 (1987), N. C. Const., Art. III, §§ 7(1), (2) (establishing the office of attorney general and declaring that his duties shall be prescribed by law). But North Carolina's General Assembly has also empowered the leaders of its two legislative houses to participate in litigation on the State's behalf under certain circumstances and with counsel of their own choosing. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1-72.2 (2021).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,37,"The reasons why a State might choose to proceed this way are understandable enough. Sometimes leaders in different branches of government may see the State's interests at stake in litigation differently. Some States may judge that important public perspectives would be lost without a mechanism allowing multiple officials to respond. It seems North Carolina has some experience with just these sorts of issues. More than once a North Carolina attorney general has opposed laws enacted by the General Assembly and declined to defend them fully in federal litigation. See, e.g., North Carolina v. North Carolina  State Conference of NAACP, 581 U. S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 1399, 1399, 198 L.Ed.2d 220 (2017) (ROBERTS, C. J., statement respecting denial of certiorari), App. 79, see also N.

2021-056,39,"The facts of this case also illustrate how divided state government can lead to disagreements over the defense of state law in federal court. In November 2018, the people of North Carolina amended the State Constitution to provide that voters offering to vote in person shall present photographic identification (photo ID). Art. VI, § 2(4). The people further provided that the General Assembly shall enact general laws governing the requirements of such photographic identification, which may include exceptions. Ibid. Consistent with that directive, the General Assembly eventually approved Senate Bill 824 (S. B. 824). 2017 Gen. Assem., 2018 Reg. Sess. Under that law's terms, those seeking to vote must do one of three things: present an acceptable photo ID, complete a provisional ballot and later produce a photo ID, or submit a form explaining why they cannot present a photo ID. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§ 163A-1145.1(a), (c), (d), as added by § 1.2(a), 2018 N. C. Sess. Laws 144, pp. 73-74. Photo ID cards are available free of charge in each of the State's 100 counties without the need for corroborating documentation. § 163A-869.1, as added by § 1.1(a), id., at 72-73. After the law's passage, the Governor vetoed the bill, the General Assembly responded by overriding that veto, and S. B. 824 went into effect on December 19, 2018.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,40,"The next day, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) sued the Governor and the members of the State Board of Elections (collectively, Board). The Governor appoints the Board's members and may remove them under certain circumstances. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§ 143B-16, 163-19, 163-40. In its lawsuit, the NAACP alleged that S. B. 824 offends the Federal Constitution. The State's attorney general assumed responsibility for defending the Board. See § 114-2. Like the Governor, the attorney general is an independently elected official. See N. C. Const., Art. III, § 7(1). Much like the Governor, too, while serving as a state senator the attorney general voted against an earlier voter-ID law and filed a declaration in support of a legal challenge against it.

They noted that North Carolina law expressly authorizes them to intervene on behalf of the General Assembly as a party in any judicial proceeding challenging a North Carolina statute or provision of the North Carolina Constitution. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1-72.2(b). They observed that, in cases of this sort, state law further provides that both the General Assembly and the Governor constitute the State of North Carolina. § 1-72.2(a). And the legislative leaders suggested that, without their participation, important state interests would not be adequately represented in light of the Governor's opposition to S. B. 824, the Board's allegiance to the Governor, and the attorney general's opposition to earlier voter-ID efforts. App. 65-70. Finally, the legislative leaders pointed to parallel state-court proceedings in which they claimed  the Board had offered only a tepid defense of S. B. 824. Id., at 127, n. 1.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,42,"The District Court denied the motion to intervene. North Carolina State Conference of NAACP v. Cooper, 332 F.R.D. 161 (MDNC 2019). In doing so, the court applied a presumption that the legislative leaders' interests would be adequately represented by the Governor and Board and their legal representative, the attorney general. Id., at 168-170. On the court's view, the legislative leaders might someday have an interest sufficient to warrant intervention if the existing parties refused to offer any defense of S. B. 824. Id., at 166. But because nothing like that had yet happened, the District Court denied the motion to intervene without prejudice to renewal later. Id., at 172-173.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,43,"In time, the legislative leaders took up the District Court's offer to renew their motion. They pointed to this Court's intervening decision in Bethune-Hill, which clarified that legislative leaders sometimes may be legally entitled to intervene and represent the interest of the State in defending the constitutionality of a state law. App. 159. They also updated the District Court on the Board's conduct in state-court proceedings. There, the Board had conceded that its `primary objective' wasn't defending S. B. 824, but obtaining guidance regarding which law it would need to enforce in an upcoming election (S. B. 824 or preexisting law). Id., at 156. Seizing on this concession, the state-court plaintiffs argued that even the Board did not think it would ultimately prevail on the merits. Id., at 157. In the end, however, the District Court was unmoved by these developments. It denied the legislative leaders' renewed motion and addressed Bethune-Hill only in a footnote stating that the decision did not change the calculus. North Carolina State Conference of NAACP v.

2021-056,44,"As the federal litigation proceeded without the legislative leaders, the NAACP sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the Board from enforcing S. B. 824 in upcoming elections. By this point, the District Court had dismissed the Governor from the suit. Only the Board members, represented by the attorney general, remained as defendants. In support of its motion for injunctive relief, the NAACP offered five expert reports. In reply, the Board did not oppose the motion on timeliness grounds even though the NAACP had waited nine months before seeking what it described as critical emergency relief. See App. 311-313, Memorandum of Law in No. 1:18-cv-1034 (MDNC, Sept. 17, 2019), ECF Doc. 73. Nor did the Board produce competing expert reports. Instead, it supplied a single affidavit from its executive director and stressed again the need for clarity about which law to apply. App. 312. Once more unsatisfied with the vigor of the Board's response, the legislative leaders sought to lodge an amicus brief, five expert reports, and several other declarations. At the end of the day, however, the District Court refused to consider the amicus brief and accompanying materials, struck them from the record, and granted a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of S. B. 824. North Carolina State Conference of NAACP v. Cooper, 430 F.Supp.3d 15, 54 (MDNC 2019).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,46,"The Fourth Circuit took up the District Court's preliminary injunction and intervention rulings in separate appeals before separate panels. While these appeals were pending, the Board did not seek an interim stay of the District Court's preliminary injunction. Apparently, it chose not to do so due to the disruptive effect such relief  would have had on election administration. App. 366, n. 8. As a result, S. B. 824 was not enforced during the State's March 2020 primary election.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,47,"In the appeal concerning the District Court's preliminary injunction ruling, the legislative leaders sought leave to intervene and the Fourth Circuit granted their motion. See Order in North Carolina State Conference of NAACP v. Raymond, No. 20-1092 (CA4, Mar. 27, 2020), ECF Doc. 43. Meanwhile, the Governor filed an amicus brief contending that the District Court had not gone far enough: The preliminary injunction should be made permanent, and  this unconstitutional law should never go into effect. App. 844. After considering all the submissions before it, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals largely agreed with the legislative leaders and reversed. North Carolina State Conference of NAACP v. Raymond, 981 F.3d 295, 298 (2020). The panel held that the District Court had abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction because the record contained insufficient evidence to show that S. B. 824 violated the Federal Constitution. In particular, the panel explained that North Carolina's law is more protective of the right to vote than other states' voter ID laws that courts have approved. Id., at 310. Later, the Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc, no judge noted a dissent. Any further District Court proceedings were thus left to unfold without a preliminary injunction in place.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,48,"Separately and hoping to participate in those future proceedings, the legislative leaders asked another panel of the Fourth Circuit to vacate the District Court's decision denying their motion to intervene. The legislative leaders stressed that state law expressly authorizes them to participate in cases like this one, and they argued that they satisfied all the requirements for intervention as a matter of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2). For its part, the Court of Appeals again agreed with the legislative leaders, this time holding that the District Court had erred when denying them leave to intervene. 970 F.3d 489, 503-504, 506 (2020).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,49,"Eventually, however, the Fourth Circuit decided to rehear the matter en banc and changed course. A nine-judge majority ruled that the legislative leaders were not entitled to intervene in District Court proceedings because they could not overcome a heightened presumption that the Board already adequately represented their interests. 999 F.3d 915, 927, 932-934 (2021). Six judges dissented. Among other things, the dissenters suggested that the majority had erred by ignoring North Carolina's law requesting two agents in cases challenging the constitutionality of its duly-enacted statutes and by setting the bar for the Intervenors to clear too high.

2021-056,50,"The legislative leaders responded by petitioning this Court to review the Fourth Circuit's en banc ruling.

2021-056,52,"Our starting point lies in Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As relevant here, the Rule provides that a court must permit anyone to intervene who, (1) on timely motion, (2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing  of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, (3) unless existing parties adequately represent that interest. Everyone before us agrees that the legislative leaders' motion to intervene was timely. The only disagreements we face concern the Rule's two remaining requirements.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,54,"We focus first on the question whether the legislative leaders have claimed an interest in the resolution of this lawsuit that may be practically impaired or impeded without their participation. No one questions that States possess `a legitimate interest in the continued enforcement of their own statutes.' Cameron v. EMW Women's Surgical Center, P. S. C., 595 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1002, 1011, 212 L.Ed.2d 114 (2022) (quoting Taylor, 477 U.S., at 137, 106 S.Ct. 2440). No one questions that States may organize themselves in a variety of ways. After all, the separation of government powers has long been recognized as vital to the preservation of liberty, and it is through the power to structure  its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority, that a State defines itself as a sovereign. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991). Nor does anyone question that, when a State chooses to allocate authority among different officials who do not answer to one another, different interests and perspectives, all important to the administration of state government, may emerge. See, e.g., Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2321, 210 L.Ed.2d 753 (2021) (Arizona's secretary of state and attorney general took opposite sides).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,55,Appropriate respect for these realities suggests that federal courts should rarely question that a State's interests will be practically impaired or impeded if its duly authorized representatives are excluded from participating in federal litigation challenging state law. To hold otherwise would not only evince disrespect for a State's chosen means of diffusing its sovereign powers among various branches and officials. It would not only risk turning a deaf federal ear to voices the State has deemed crucial to understanding the full range of its interests. It would encourage plaintiffs to make strategic choices to control which state agents they will face across the aisle in federal court. It would tempt litigants to select as their defendants those individual officials they consider most sympathetic to their cause or most inclined to settle favorably and quickly. All of which would risk a hobbled litigation rather than a full and fair adversarial testing of the State's interests and arguments.,Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,56,"Nor are state interests the only interests at stake. Respecting the States' plans for the distribution of governmental powers also serves important national interests. Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 615, n. 13, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974). It better enables the States to serve as a balance to federal authority. Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 221, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011). It permits States to accommodate government to local conditions and circumstances. See ibid. And it allows States to serve as laboratories of innovation and experimentation from which the federal government itself may learn and from which a mobile citizenry benefits. Gregory, 501 U.S., at 458, 111 S.Ct. 2395. Finally, a federal court tasked with testing the constitutionality of state law wields weighty authority over a State's most fundamental political processes. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 751, 119  S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). Permitting the participation of lawfully authorized state agents promotes informed federal-court decisionmaking and avoids the risk of setting aside duly enacted state law based on an incomplete understanding of relevant state interests.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,57,"This Court's teachings on these scores have been many, clear, and recent. Earlier this Term in Cameron, we explained that a State is free to empower multiple officials to defend its sovereign interests in federal court. 595 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1011. Three Terms ago in Bethune-Hill, we observed that `a State must be able to designate agents to represent it in federal court' and may authorize its legislature to litigate on the State's behalf, either generally or in a defined set of cases. 587 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1951-52. The choice belongs to the sovereign State. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1952. In Hollingsworth v. Perry, this Court stressed that state law may provide for other officials, besides an attorney general, to speak for the State in federal court as some States have done for their presiding legislative officers. 570 U.S. 693, 710, 133 S.Ct. 2652, 186 L.Ed.2d 768 (2013). And in Karcher v. May, this Court held that two state legislative leaders authorized under state law to represent the State's interests in federal court could defend state laws there as parties. 484 U.S. 72, 75, 81-82, 108 S.Ct. 388, 98 L.Ed.2d 327 (1987).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,58,"These principles and precedents are dispositive here. North Carolina has expressly authorized the legislative leaders to defend the State's practical interests in litigation of this sort. State law provides that the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, as agents of the State, by and through counsel of their choice, shall jointly have standing to intervene on behalf of the General Assembly as a party in any judicial proceeding challenging a North Carolina statute or provision of the North Carolina Constitution. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1-72.2(b). Even beyond these instructions, the State has made plain that it considers the leaders of the General Assembly necessary parties to suits like this one. § 120-32.6(b).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,59,"Tellingly, the Board seems to agree that, if North Carolina law authorizes participation by the legislative leaders on behalf of the State, a federal court should find the interest requirement of Rule 24(a)(2) satisfied. Brief for State Respondents 20, 28. The Board submits only that, in fact, North Carolina law does not afford the legislative leaders that authority. Id., at 49-50. But while we are hardly the final arbiters of North Carolina law, the Board's argument seems more than a little difficult to square with the express statutory language above. One of these provisions is even entitled, General Assembly Acting on Behalf of the State of North Carolina in Certain Actions. § 120-32.6(b). It provides that the legislative leaders may defend state laws as agents of the State. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,60,"Retreating, the Board argues alternatively that the statutes authorizing the legislative leaders to participate here violate the State Constitution by usurping authority vested in the executive branch. Brief for State Respondents 50-55, N. C. Const., Art. I, § 6. But the Board's logic is hard to follow given its concession that the legislative leaders may intervene permissively under Rule 24(b), and likely as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) if the attorney general ceases to represent the Board. Brief for State Respondents 2, 48, 55. Nor, for that matter, does the Board identify anything to support its suggestion that the State's executive branch holds a constitutional monopoly on representing North Carolina's practical interests in  court. Instead, the parties direct us to a provision stating that the General Assembly may determine the scope of the attorney general's powers. See N. C. Const., Art. III, § 7(2), Bailey v. State, 353 N.C. 142, 152-153, 540 S.E.2d 313, 320 (2000). And, as we have seen, while the General Assembly has afforded the attorney general considerable authority, it has also reserved to itself some authority to defend state law on behalf of the State. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 120-32.6(b). In fact, it seems the General Assembly has sometimes even entrusted the defense of state interests to private persons. See § 1-608(b) (permitting private citizens to bring falseclaims actions for the State).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,61,"The NAACP offers a different reply. It points out that Rule 24(a)(2) permits intervention only by new parties. And, it submits, the legislative leaders are already effectively existing parties to this suit challenging the enforcement of state law. Brief for NAACP Respondents 12-14. But whatever other problems may attend this argument, it rests on a premise that is both formally and functionally mistaken. As a formal matter and consistent with principles of sovereign immunity, the NAACP has not sued the State. Only state officers are or may be parties here—and, so far, the legislative leaders are not among them. See Young, 209 U.S., at 159-160, 28 S.Ct. 441. Functionally, of course, this suit implicates North Carolina's sovereign interests regardless of the named parties. See Part I-A, supra. Yet, contrary to the premise implicit in the NAACP's argument, a plaintiff who chooses to name this or that official defendant does not necessarily and always capture all relevant state interests. Instead and as we have seen, where a State chooses to divide its sovereign authority among different officials and authorize their participation in a suit challenging state law, a full consideration of the State's practical interests may require the involvement of different voices with different perspectives. To hold otherwise would risk allowing a private plaintiff to pick its preferred defendants and potentially silence those whom the State deems essential to a fair understanding of its interests.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,63,"The only remaining question we face concerns adequacy of representation. Interpreting Rule 24(a)(2), lower courts have adopted a variety of tests for evaluating whether an existing defendant already adequately represents the same interests a proposed intervenor seeks to vindicate. In this case, both the District Court and the en banc Court of Appeals applied a presumption that the Board adequately represented the legislative leaders' interests and held that the leaders could not overcome this presumption. 999 F.3d, at 934, Cooper, 332 F.R.D., at 171.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,64,"Once more, we cannot agree. As an initial matter, Rule 24(a)(2) promises intervention to those who bear an interest that may be practically impaired or impeded unless existing parties adequately represent that interest. In some cases, too, this Court has described the Rule's test as presenting proposed intervenors with only a minimal challenge.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,65,"Take Trbovich v. Mine Workers, in which this Court addressed a request to intervene by a private party who asserted a related interest to that of an existing government party. 404 U.S. 528, 92 S.Ct. 630, 30 L.Ed.2d 686 (1972). There, the Secretary of Labor sued to set aside a union election. The same union member who filed the administrative complaint that triggered the Secretary's suit sought to intervene under Rule 24(a). Id., at 529-530, 92 S.Ct. 630. At a high level of abstraction, the union member's interest and the Secretary's  might have seemed closely aligned. Even so, this Court rejected the Secretary's suggestion that he should be presumed an adequate representative of the union member's interests unless the court  finds that the Secretary has failed to perform his statutory duty. Id., at 538, 92 S.Ct. 630. The Court acknowledged that the Secretary's and the union member's interests were related, but it emphasized that the interests were not identical—the union member sought relief against his union, full stop, meanwhile, the Secretary also had to bear in mind broader public-policy implications. Id., at 538-539, 92 S.Ct. 630. Rather than endorse a presumption of adequacy, the Court held that a movant's burden in circumstances like these should be treated as minimal. Id., at 538, n. 10, 92 S.Ct. 630.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,66,"To be sure, some lower courts have suggested that a presumption of adequate representation remains appropriate in certain classes of cases. But even taken on their own terms, none of these presumptions applies to cases like ours. For example, the Fourth Circuit has endorsed a presumption of adequate representation where a member of the public seeks to intervene to defend a law alongside the government. See 999 F.3d, at 932-933. There, the Fourth Circuit has reasoned, a court may presume that legally authorized government agents will adequately represent the public's interest in its chosen laws. Here, by contrast, the legislative leaders are among those North Carolina has expressly authorized to participate in litigation to protect the State's interests in its duly enacted laws.

2021-056,67,"Similarly, some lower courts have adopted a presumption of adequate representation in cases where a movant's interests are identical to those of an existing party. See 7C C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1909 (3d ed. Supp. 2022) (Wright & Miller). But even the Board concedes that this presumption applies only when interests overlap fully. Brief for State Respondents 26. Where the absentee's interest is similar to, but not identical with, that of one of the parties, that normally is not enough to trigger a presumption of adequate representation. 7C Wright & Miller § 1909. And again, a presumption like that holds no purchase here. North Carolina has authorized different agents to defend its practical interests precisely because, thanks to how it has structured its government, each may be expected to vindicate different points of view on the State's behalf. For a federal court to presume a full overlap of interests when state law more nearly presumes the opposite would make little sense and do much violence to our system of cooperative federalism. In cases like ours, state agents may pursue related state interests, but they cannot be fairly presumed to bear identical ones. Trbovich, 404 U.S., at 538, 92 S.Ct. 630.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,68,"In the end, to resolve this case we need not decide whether a presumption of adequate representation might sometimes be appropriate when a private litigant seeks to defend a law alongside the government or in any other circumstance. We need only acknowledge that a presumption of adequate representation is inappropriate when a duly authorized state agent seeks to intervene to defend a state law. In its en banc decision, the Fourth Circuit reasoned that a proposed intervenor's governmental status makes a heightened presumption of adequacy more appropriate, not less. 999 F.3d, at 933, accord, Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Kaul, 942 F.3d 793, 801 (CA7 2019). But, respectfully, that gets things backward. Any presumption against intervention is especially inappropriate when wielded to displace a State's prerogative to select which agents may defend its  laws and protect its interests. Normally, a State's chosen representatives should be greeted in federal court with respect, not adverse presumptions. If the intervenor in Trbovich faced only a minimal burden, it cannot be that duly designated state agents seeking to vindicate state law should have to clear some higher hurdle.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,69,"Setting aside the lower courts' erroneous presumptions, the proper resolution of today's case follows quickly. Casting aspersions on no one, this litigation illustrates how divided state governments sometimes warrant participation by multiple state officials in federal court. See 999 F.3d, at 939-941 (Wilkinson, J., dissenting). Recall just some of the facts of this case. See Parts I-B and I-C, supra. When confronted with a motion for a preliminary injunction, the Board declined to offer expert-witness affidavits in support of S. B. 824, even though its opponent offered many and the legislative leaders sought to supplement the record with their own. After the District Court issued its (ultimately overturned) injunction, the Board declined to seek a stay. That tactical choice, motivated by the Board's overriding concern for stability and certainty, meant that the State could not enforce its new law during a statewide election. Throughout, Board members have been appointed and potentially removable by a Governor who vetoed S. B. 824 and who filed his own briefs in this litigation calling the law unconstitutional and arguing that it should never go into effect. See supra, at 2199-2200. And at all times, the Board has been represented by an attorney general who, though no doubt a vigorous advocate for his clients' interests, is also an elected official who may feel allegiance to the voting public or share the Board's administrative concerns.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,70,"The legislative leaders seek to give voice to a different perspective. Their primary objective is not clarifying which law applies. See supra, at 2199. They are not burdened by misgivings about the law's wisdom. If allowed to intervene, the legislative leaders say, they will focus on defending the law vigorously on the merits without an eye to crosscutting administrative concerns. And, they add, the differences between their interest and the Board's in this case demonstrate why state law empowers them to participate in litigation over the validity of state legislation— alive as it is to the possibility that different branches of government may seek to vindicate different and valuable state interests. Perhaps recognizing all this, the Fourth Circuit itself allowed the legislative leaders to intervene in the appeal from the District Court's preliminary injunction ruling. The same result should follow here.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,71,"By way of reply, the NAACP—but not the Board—worries that allowing the legislative leaders to intervene could make trial management impossible. Brief for NAACP Respondents 26, but see Tr. of Oral Arg. 64 (noting that the Board has no problem litigating alongside the legislative leaders). We are not insensitive to the concern. In some other case, a proliferation of motions to intervene may be a cause for caution. At some point, too, it may be that the interests of existing parties will come to overlap fully with the interests of any remaining proposed intervenor.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,72,"But that case is not this case. Not only do the legislative leaders bring a distinct state interest to bear on this litigation. No one has suggested that a cascade of motions lies on the horizon here. Recall that the NAACP initially named the Governor as a defendant. Absent his eventual dismissal from this litigation, the Governor might have been able to hire his own outside counsel while the attorney general continued to represent the Board. See Martin, 320 N.C., at 547-548, 359 S.E.2d,  at 480. Introducing the legislative leaders and their counsel after the Governor's departure may not represent a neat one-for-one swap. But litigation on this scale is hardly inconsistent with what the Board and the NAACP originally anticipated.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-056,73,"Nor is it unusual. In matters ranging from civil-rights actions to suits testing the constitutionality of state or federal legislation, federal courts routinely handle cases involving multiple officials sometimes represented by different attorneys taking different positions. See, e.g., Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson, 595 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2494, 210 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2021), Brnovich, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2321, 210 L.Ed.2d 753, United States v.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam). This Court even hears cases in which officials from a single State have sued each other in federal court. See, e.g., Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011).

2021-056,74,"Through the General Assembly, the people of North Carolina have authorized the leaders of their legislature to defend duly enacted state statutes against constitutional challenge. Ordinarily, a federal court must respect that kind of sovereign choice, not assemble presumptions against it.

2021-056,77,"When an individual or entity moves to intervene in a pending lawsuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), a federal court is not authorized to grant the motion if an existing party to the case adequately represents the movant's interests. Today, however, the Court holds that two leaders of the North Carolina General Assembly are entitled to intervene as a matter of right to represent the State's interest in defending the constitutionality of North Carolina law, even though that interest is already being ably pursued on the State's behalf by an existing state party to the litigation. The Court's decision is wrong for two reasons. First, the Court goes astray by creating a presumption that a State is inadequately represented in federal court unless whomever state law designates as a State's representative is allowed to intervene, even where the interests that the intervenors seek to represent are identical to those of an existing party.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,78,"That presumption of inadequacy improperly permits state law, as opposed to federal law, to determine whether an existing party adequately represents a particular interest. Second, the Court errs by implying that the attorney general's defense of the constitutionality of the voting law at issue here fell below a minimal standard of adequacy. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,80,"The underlying dispute in this case concerns the constitutionality of North Carolina's voter-identification law, Senate Bill 824 (S. B. 824), enacted in 2018. The North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP (NAACP respondents) sued members of the North Carolina State Board of Elections (state respondents) and the Governor in Federal District Court, alleging that the law violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and § 2 of the Voting Rights Act by, among other things, discriminating against Black and Latino voters. The state attorney general appeared as counsel to represent the Governor and state respondents. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 114-2 (2021) (providing that the attorney general has a duty to appear for the State in any matter in which the State may be a party or interested and to represent all State departments, agencies, institutions, commissions, bureaus or other organized activities of the State). NAACP respondents also filed a parallel challenge to S. B. 824 in state court. See Holmes v. Moore, No. 18-CV-15292 (Super. Ct. Wake Cty., N. C.).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,81,"Shortly after the federal suit was filed, Philip E. Berger, the president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Timothy K. Moore, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives (petitioners here), filed a motion to intervene on behalf of the General Assembly. App. 55. They sought to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), claiming a significantly protectable interest in the validity of S.B. 824. App. 61. Petitioners cited, among other things, a state statute conferring upon them standing to intervene on behalf of the General Assembly in cases challenging state law. Id., at 61-62 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1-72.2). In the alternative, petitioners sought permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,82,"The District Court denied the motion without prejudice, explaining that petitioners lacked a significantly protectable interest in  defending the constitutionality of S.B. 824 sufficient to warrant a right to intervene under Rule 24(a)(2) because the Governor and state respondents remained in the suit and were adequately defending the challenged law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 168. The court also reasoned that allowing petitioners to intervene would `hinder, rather than enhance, judicial economy' and would `unnecessarily complicate and delay' the various stages of this case, including discovery, dispositive motions, and trial. Id., at 180. The court granted petitioners' motion to participate in the suit as amici, however, and assured petitioners that they could renew their motion to intervene if the attorney general, as counsel for the existing state parties, declined to defend the lawsuit. Id., at 157.1 Petitioners did not appeal. Shortly thereafter, the District Court granted the Governor's motion to dismiss him from the suit. The attorney general continued representing state respondents in the litigation.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,83,"Six weeks after the District Court denied their original intervention motion,  petitioners filed a renewed motion, again seeking both to intervene as a matter of right and permissively. Petitioners primarily reiterated arguments made in their first motion for intervention, adding that this Court's decision in Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill, 587 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1945, 204 L.Ed.2d 305 (2019), clarified the interests they sought to represent. App. 159. They also asserted that the attorney general's conduct in the parallel state-court litigation, in which petitioners were codefendants, supported petitioners' argument for intervention. Specifically, petitioners argued that the attorney general moved to dismiss five of six claims in the state-court litigation, but not the sixth, failed to defend against NAACP respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction, and did not seriously engage in discovery. Id., at 164.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,84,"The District Court again denied the motion, explaining that it was abundantly clear that state respondents are actively and adequately defending this lawsuit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 189. The court recounted that state respondents had consistently `denied all substantive allegations of unconstitutionality' in this case and had filed an expansive brief opposing NAACP respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction on the merits. Ibid. The court also rejected petitioners' argument that the attorney general's conduct in the pending state-court litigation was inadequate. The court explained that the attorney general's decision not to move to dismiss the sixth state-court claim in that separate litigation fell well within the range of reasonable litigation strategies, that the attorney general secured reversal of the state-court preliminary injunction on appeal, and that the attorney general `participated in extensive fact discovery' in the state-court litigation. Id., at 191, 192. The court therefore found no sound basis on which to speculate  that state respondents and the Attorney General would abandon their duty to defend S.B. 824 in this case, given that, by all appearances, they had fully executed that duty in both the federal- and state-court litigation thus far. Id., at 193.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,85,"The District Court also rejected petitioners' request for permissive intervention. In the court's view, petitioners' contentions in the federal litigation, including their repeated skepticism of state respondents' ability to defend state law vigorously, demonstrated that intervention would only distract from the pressing issues in this case. Id., at 193-194.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,86,"Over a dissent by Judge Harris, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's order and remanded for reconsideration of petitioners' request to intervene.

2021-056,87,"The en banc court began by stressing that its jurisdiction was limited to reviewing the order from which petitioners had chosen to appeal. Because petitioners had not appealed the District Court's denial of their first intervention motion seeking to represent the General Assembly's `institutional interest' in enforcement of S.B. 824, the Court of Appeals determined it could not review petitioners' claim that they were representing that particular institutional interest. 999 F.3d 915, 926 (CA4 2021). The en banc court instead addressed petitioners' argument that they were mandatorily entitled to represent the interest of the State in defending the constitutionality of S. B. 824.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,88,"In its merits analysis, the en banc court observed that Rule 24(a)(2) contains several requirements, including that a proposed intervenor demonstrate both `an interest in the subject matter of the action' and `that the proposed intervenor's interest  is not adequately represented by existing parties to the litigation.' Id., at 927 (quoting Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24(a)(2)). The court noted that petitioners had not asked the District Court and the Court of Appeals to consider whether state law was relevant to Rule 24(a)(2)'s adequacy requirement, as opposed to its interest requirement. See 999 F.3d, at 930, n. 3. The court concluded that N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1-72.2, the state statute authorizing petitioners to intervene in cases challenging state law, bore on only the interest requirement. The court explained that a state's policy judgment about the value of legislative intervention may bestow a protectable interest in certain court cases, but it does not override a federal court's normal standards for evaluating the adequacy of existing representation in those cases. 999 F.3d, at 929, n. 3 (emphasis added).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,89,"The court assumed (as to the former requirement) that petitioners had established a protectable interest in the subject matter of the litigation, but held (as to the latter requirement) that this purported interest in defending S.B. 824 on behalf of the State of North Carolina was adequately represented by existing parties to the litigation. Id., at 927. Accordingly, the court concluded that petitioners had no right to intervene in federal court under Rule 24(a)(2). Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,90,"This Court granted certiorari. 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 577, 211 L.Ed.2d 360 (2021).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,92,"At the heart of this case is Rule 24(a)(2), which governs intervention as of right. As relevant here, Rule 24(a)(2) provides that a court must permit anyone to intervene who, (1) on timely motion, (2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, (3) unless existing parties adequately represent that interest. This case requires the Court to address how state laws affect mandatory intervention under Rule 24(a)(2).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,93,"I begin with points of agreement: The Court and I agree that States may organize themselves in a variety of ways. Ante, at 2201, see Bethune-Hill, 587 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1951 (contrasting Virginia's choice to vest authority and responsibility for representing the State's interests in civil litigation  exclusively with the State's Attorney General with other States' decisions to authorize other agents to litigate on the State's behalf). We agree that a State is free to designate who will represent it in federal court. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 710, 133 S.Ct. 2652, 186 L.Ed.2d 768 (2013) (observing that although that agent is typically the State's attorney general, States may make a different choice), see also Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Kaul, 942 F.3d 793, 802 (CA7 2019) (We can see no reason why a federal court would bat an eye if a state required its attorney general to withdraw from his representation and allow another entity, including a legislature, to take over a case). We also agree that state law can create a protectable interest in the resolution of a federal lawsuit. See Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986) (A State clearly has a legitimate interest in the continued enforceability of its own statutes).2  I part ways with the Court because it is clear that Rule 24(a)(2) does not give a State the right to have multiple parties represent the same interest. Rather, Rule 24(a)(2) explicitly authorizes additional parties to intervene in pending litigation only if their interests are not adequately represented by an existing party.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,94,"The Court instead concludes that the undisputed principles discussed above establish a presumption that a State's interests are not adequately represented if any of its duly authorized representatives are excluded from participating in federal litigation challenging state law. Ante, at 2201 (stating that federal courts should rarely question that a State's interests will be practically impaired or impeded in these circumstances). In the Court's view, because North Carolina law provides that the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall jointly have standing to intervene on behalf of the General Assembly as a party in any judicial proceeding challenging a North Carolina statute or provision of the North Carolina Constitution, N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 1-72.2(b), a federal court should find the interest requirement of Rule 24(a)(2) satisfied, ante, at 2202. The Court so holds despite the fact that state respondents already represent the State's interests in this litigation in a manner that the District Court found adequate, and where the attorney general's defense of the constitutionality of the voter-identification law has thus far proved successful.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,95,"The Court's presumption of inadequacy is novel. Neither petitioners nor the Court identify a single precedent in which a state actor was entitled to intervene as of right to defend a statute that another state actor already was defending. Rather, the issue in all cases the Court cites was whether any state official would be allowed to defend a State's interest when an official charged with doing so declined to do so. Cf. Cameron v. EMW Women's Surgical Center, P. S. C., 595 U. S. ___, ___ n. 5, 142 S.Ct. 1002, 1012 n.5, 212 L.Ed.2d 114 (2022) (allowing Kentucky attorney general to intervene in federal appellate proceeding to defend Kentucky's interests once no other official was willing to do so), Karcher v. May, 484 U.S. 72, 75, 81-82, 108 S.Ct. 388, 98 L.Ed.2d 327 (1987) (holding that two state legislators could intervene to defend the constitutionality of state law after the attorney general declined to do so), Bethune-Hill, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1951 (rejecting argument that the Virginia House of Delegates and its Speaker, who intervened specifically to represent their own interests rather than those of the State as a whole, could displace the attorney general as representative of the State), see also Hollingsworth, 570 U.S., at 707, 713, 133 S.Ct. 2652 (holding that proponents of a ballot initiative who had no role  in the enforcement of the initiative and were not agents of the State lacked standing to defend it on appeal).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,96,"None of these precedents establish that state law can require a federal court to allow additional state actors to intervene when another state actor is already ably and fully representing the State's interests in the litigation. To the contrary, it is well settled that the question whether an interest is being adequately represented is one of federal law, not state law. See 7C C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1905 (3d ed. Supp. 2022) (Wright, Miller, & Kane) (citing cases and observing that it is wholly clear that the right to intervene in a civil action pending in a United States District  Court is governed by Rule 24 and not by state law). Petitioners themselves, until they arrived at this Court, never adopted the view that state law can supplant a federal court's responsibility to decide adequacy of representation in an individual case.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,97,"The Court's conclusion that state law can dictate what counts as adequate representation also suffers from practical infirmities. If state law can require a federal court to allow a second state actor to intervene to represent a different perspective, ante, at 2205, what is to stop a State from designating 3, 4, or 10 or more officials as necessary parties to suits challenging state law? The Court acknowledges this concern but offers no limiting principle grounded in Rule 24(a)(2). Ante, at 2205-2206. That is because it cannot: Under the Court's logic, a federal court would have no choice but to allow all 10 or more state officials to intervene.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,98,"This result contravenes Rule 24(a)(2) and the practical realities of litigation that it reflects. Federal law gives district courts responsibility to assess, in the first instance, the adequacy of a party's representation because those courts are most familiar with that representation and are responsible for managing their dockets and streamlining proceedings. Rule 24(a)(2) thus does not require district courts to allow intervention where interests are adequately represented because such intervention would be duplicative and inefficient. This Rule accounts for the fact that mandatory intervention imposes costs on the original parties, on the court, and on all others whose interests depend on timely resolution of a given case. Forcing federal courts to accommodate a cacophony of parties, 999 F.3d, at 934, as the Court's logic today requires, will result in an intractable procedural mess, leaving district courts with no basis for divining the true position of the State on issues like the meaning of state law, or even for purposes of doctrines like judicial estoppel. Kaul, 942 F.3d, at 801-802, see New Jersey v. New York, 345 U.S. 369, 373, 73 S.Ct. 689, 97 L.Ed. 1081 (1953) (per curiam) (declining to be drawn into intramural dispute within a State).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,99,"It is difficult to overstate the burden the Court's holding will foist on district courts. Each intervenor will be entitled to file its own brief concerning every motion and will be entitled to its own discovery. Even when state agents' positions align, this multitude of parties will clog federal courts and delay the administration of justice.3 When state agents' positions diverge, courts will also be put in the unenviable position of determining which of a State's representatives  better represents it. 999 F.3d, at 934. Out of respect for federalism, if nothing else, we should not interpret state law to hijack federal courts' ability to manage litigation involving States. See Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 272, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011) (ROBERTS, C.

2021-056,101,"Aided by its new presumption of inadequacy, the Court concludes that state respondents  inadequately represented petitioners' stated interests. The Court states that in so holding, it casts aspersions on no one. Ante, at 2205. In the Court's view, however, petitioners (unlike state respondents and their counsel, the attorney general) are not burdened by misgivings about the law's wisdom, and therefore should be allowed to intervene to give voice to a different perspective. Ibid. The implication of the Court's holding is clear: The attorney general's performance fell short of representing adequately the State's interests in the constitutionality of its law, and for that reason, petitioners should be allowed to intervene.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,102,"This is simply wrong. As a preliminary matter, petitioners and state respondents share the same interest: ensuring the validity and enforcement of S. B. 824. Cf. Trbovich v.

Here, state respondents explain that they represent the State's interest in defending its laws. Brief for State Respondents 18. Their counsel, the attorney general, is required to do the same under North Carolina law. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 114-2. Identically, petitioners represent that they seek to defend the State's vital interest in defending the constitutionality of North Carolina's election laws. Brief for Petitioners 15-16. Indeed, petitioners cannot now seek to represent any unique interest of the General Assembly in the litigation because they abandoned that argument by failing to appeal the District Court's original order denying intervention on that basis. By their own admission, then, petitioners seek only to represent the State's interest in defending state law, an interest that state respondents already represent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,103,"The Court insists that petitioners' perspective nevertheless differs from that of state respondents, by focusing on defending the law vigorously on the merits without an eye to crosscutting administrative concerns such as obtaining guidance for the administration of upcoming elections. Ante, at 2205, see Brief for Petitioners 48 (The differing perspectives of Petitioners and State Board Respondents are a product of their different relationships to the State). The Court's position rests in part on the assumption that leaders of the General Assembly have a unique interest that should be represented in the litigation. As noted, however, the case's procedural posture forecloses that argument because petitioners forfeited it.4",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,104,"In any event, the difference in perspective the Court perceives boils down only to a disagreement over trial strategy. As the Court rightly concedes, the State has a strong interest in the orderly administration of its elections. See ante, at 2205 (acknowledging state respondents' interest in stability and certainty in an upcoming election). That is not, however, the only state interest that state respondents, represented by the attorney general, sought to defend. The attorney general has insisted all along that the interests he seeks to represent, and indeed is required to represent under state law, include defending the constitutionality of North Carolina laws  like the voter-identification law at issue here. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 114-2. These state interests are not mutually exclusive. The attorney general's choice to emphasize the State's interest in election administration at a particular stage of the litigation, while simultaneously maintaining a firm position on the constitutionality of S. B. 824, was merely a choice about litigation strategy. It is a choice with which petitioners might disagree, but it does not render state respondents' representation inadequate. See 7C Wright, Miller, & Kane § 1909 (A mere difference of opinion concerning the tactics with which the litigation should be handled does not make inadequate the representation of those whose interests are identical with that of an existing party), accord, Kaul, 942 F.3d, at 810-811 (Sykes, J., concurring), Daggett v. Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, 172 F.3d 104, 112 (CA1 1999).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-056,105,"Properly understood, the attorney general's representation of state respondents satisfies any standard of adequacy. As the District Court explained, the attorney general actively and adequately defended this lawsuit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 189.

See ante, at 2205. Petitioners also take issue with the attorney general's decision not to seek a stay of the District Court's preliminary injunction pending appeal. Brief for Petitioners 12, 50. But these are precisely the sort of strategic decisions that government attorneys make every day, in fact, petitioners themselves declined to seek a stay in the parallel litigation in state court. The Court's retrospective criticism of the attorney general's litigation strategy is insufficient to establish that state respondents inadequately represented the State's interests. See Saldano v. Roach, 363 F.3d 545, 555 (CA5 2004) (Simply because the intervenor would have made a different decision does not mean that the Attorney General is inadequately representing the State's interest—and hence, the intervenor's claimed interest—especially since state law specifically gives the Attorney General the discretion to make these kinds of decisions).",Sotomayor,0,

B. 824 and personally opposed the law) exercised appointment authority over state respondents. Ante, at 2205. The Court is right not to fully embrace this argument, which implies that the attorney general and the career professionals in his office are incapable of executing their statutory duty to represent North Carolina in litigation and defend its interests. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 114-2. Petitioners' startling accusation flies in the face of the presumption that public officials can be  trusted to exercise their official duties and overlooks the attorney general's vigorous advocacy to date. 999 F.3d, at 937, see United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926) (courts should presume that public officials have properly discharged their official duties). As the Court of Appeals explained, that the Governor or the attorney general may have expressed policy views at odds with S.B. 824 in the past is no ground for a federal court to infer that the attorney general would abdicate his official duty to the State by subterfuge, mounting a sham defense of the statute. 999 F.3d, at 937.

Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 541 (emphasis altered), see also Webster's New International Dictionary 2350 (1922) (Webster's) (worker: One that works), Funk & Wagnall's New Standard Dictionary 2731 (1913) (worker: One who or that which performs work). Further, the word engaged —meaning occupied, employed, or involved, Webster's 725, see also, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 661 (3d ed. 1933) (defining engage)—similarly emphasizes the actual work that the members of the class, as a whole, typically carry out. Saxon is therefore a member of a class of workers based on what she does at Southwest, not what Southwest does generally.",Thomas,0,

2021-057,47,"As always, we begin with the text. Again, to be engaged in something means to be occupied, employed, or involved in it. Commerce, meanwhile, includes, among other things, the transportation of  goods, both by land and by sea. Black's Law Dictionary 220 (2d ed. 1910) (Black's), see also, e.g., Webster's 448 (commerce: the exchange of merchandise on a large scale between different places or communities). Thus, any class of workers directly involved in transporting goods across state or international borders falls within § 1's exemption.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,48,"Airplane cargo loaders are such a class. We have said that it is too plain to require discussion that the loading or unloading of an interstate shipment by the employees of a carrier is so closely related to interstate transportation as to be practically a part of it. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R. Co. v. Burtch, 263 U.S. 540, 544, 44 S.Ct. 165, 68 L.Ed. 433 (1924). We think it equally plain that airline employees who physically load and unload cargo on and off planes traveling in interstate commerce are, as a practical matter, part of the interstate transportation of goods. They form a class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.2",Thomas,0,
2021-057,49,"Context confirms this reading. In Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001), we considered whether § 1 exempts all employment contracts or only those contracts involving transportation workers. Id., at 109, 121 S.Ct. 1302. In concluding that § 1 exempts only transportation-worker contracts, we relied on two well-settled canons of statutory interpretation. First, we applied the meaningful-variation canon. See, e.g., A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 170 (2012) (Where a document has used one term in one place, and a materially different term in another, the presumption is that the different term denotes a different idea). We observed that Congress used more open-ended formulations like `affecting' or `involving' commerce to signal congressional intent to regulate to the outer limits of authority under the Commerce Clause. Circuit City, 532 U.S. at 115-116, 118, 121 S.Ct. 1302. By contrast, Congress used a narrower phrase—`engaged in commerce'—when it wanted to regulate short of those limits. Id., at 118, 121 S.Ct. 1302. Second, we applied the ejusdem generis canon, which instructs courts to interpret a general or collective term at the end of a list of specific items in light of any common attributes shared by the specific items. Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 225, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169  L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). As applied to § 1, that canon counseled that the phrase `class of workers engaged in  commerce' should be controlled and defined by reference to the specific classes of `seamen' and `railroad employees' that precede it. Circuit City, 532 U.S. at 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,50,"Taken together, these canons showed that § 1 exempted only contracts with transportation workers, rather than all employees, from the FAA. See id., at 119, 121 S.Ct. 1302. And, while we did not provide a complete definition of transportation worker, we indicated that any such worker must at least play a direct and necessary role in the free flow of goods across borders. Id., at 121, 121 S.Ct. 1302. Put another way, transportation workers must be actively engaged in transportation of those goods across borders via the channels of foreign or interstate commerce. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,51,"Cargo loaders exhibit this central feature of a transportation worker. As stated above, one who loads cargo on a plane bound for interstate transit is intimately involved with the commerce (e.g., transportation) of that cargo. There could be no doubt that interstate transportation is still in progress, and that a worker is engaged in that transportation, when she is doing the work of unloading or loading cargo from a vehicle carrying goods in interstate transit. Erie R. Co. v. Shuart, 250 U.S. 465, 468, 39 S.Ct. 519, 63 L.Ed. 1088 (1919).",Thomas,0,
2021-057,52,"A final piece of statutory context further confirms that cargo loading is part of cross-border commerce. The first sentence of § 1 of the FAA defines exempted maritime transactions to include, among other things, agreements relating to wharfage, supplies furnished vessels or repairs to vessels, collisions, or any other matters in foreign commerce. (Emphasis added.) The use of other in the catchall provision indicates that Congress considered the preceding items to be matters in foreign commerce. And agreements related to the enumerated matter in foreign commerce of wharfage, to take one example, included agreements for mere access to a wharf—which is simply a cargo-loading facility. See Black's 1226 (wharfage: money paid for landing wares at a wharf, or for shipping or taking goods into a boat or barge from thence), Webster's 2323 (similar), see also, e.g., Black's 1226 (wharf: A perpendicular bank or mound extending some distance into the water, for the convenience of lading and unlading ships and other vessels). It stands to reason, then, that if payments to access a cargo-loading facility relate to a matter in foreign commerce, then an individual who actually loads cargo on foreign-bound ships docked along a wharf is himself engaged in such commerce. Likewise, any class of workers that loads or unloads cargo on or off airplanes bound for a different State or country is engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,53,"In sum, text and context point to the same place: Workers, like Saxon, who load cargo on and off airplanes belong to a class of workers in foreign or interstate commerce.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,55,Both Saxon and Southwest proffer arguments that disagree with portions of our analysis. Neither of them convinces us to change course.,Thomas,0,
2021-057,57,"For her part, Saxon thinks that we should define the class of workers as all airline employees who carry out the customary work of the airline, rather than cargo loaders more specifically. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. That larger class of employees  potentially includes everyone from cargo loaders to shift schedulers to those who design Southwest's website. See id., at 51-52, but cf. ibid. (conceding that those who run the Southwest credit-card points program likely would not count).",Thomas,0,
2021-057,58,"To support this reading, Saxon invokes the ejusdem generis canon. She argues, first, that railroad employees and seamen refer generally to employees in those industries providing dominant modes of transportation in interstate and foreign commerce. Brief for Respondent 17. She then reasons, second, that all workers who do the work of the airlines have the same relationship to commerce as those who do the work of the railroad or ship. Ibid.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,59,"Saxon's attempted invocation of ejusdem generis is unavailing because it proceeds from the flawed premise that seamen and railroad employees are both industrywide categories. The statute's use of seamen shows why that premise is mistaken. In 1925, seamen did not include all those employed by companies engaged in maritime shipping. Rather, seamen were only those whose occupation was to assist in the management of ships at sea, a mariner, a sailor,  any person (except masters, pilots, and apprentices duly indentured and registered) employed or engaged in any capacity on board any ship. Webster's 1906, see also, e.g., Black's 1063 (seamen: sailors, mariners, persons whose business is navigating ships).",Thomas,0,
2021-057,60,"Because seamen includes only those who work on board a vessel, they constitute a subset of workers engaged in the maritime shipping industry. Regardless of whether railroad employees include all rail-transportation workers, the narrow definition of seamen shows that the two terms cannot share a common attribute of identifying transportation workers on an industrywide basis. Ali, 552 U.S. at 224, 128 S.Ct. 831. We therefore reject Saxon's argument that § 1 exempts virtually all employees of major transportation providers.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,62,"While Saxon defines the relevant class of workers too broadly, Southwest construes § 1's catchall category—any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce—too narrowly. The airline argues that only workers who physically move goods or people across foreign or international boundaries—pilots, ship crews, locomotive engineers, and the like— are engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. So construed, § 1 does not exempt cargo loaders because they do not physically accompany freight across state or international boundaries.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,63,"Southwest's reading rests on three arguments. None persuades us. First, taking its turn with ejusdem generis, the airline argues that because seamen are employed on board a vessel, McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U.S. 337, 346, 111 S.Ct. 807, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991) (emphasis added), and `railroad employees' is somewhat ambiguous, Brief for Petitioner 26, we should limit the exempted class of railroad employees to those who are physically on board a locomotive as it crosses state lines. Then, having limited railroad employees in that way, Southwest likewise urges us to narrow § 1's catchall provision to exclude those airline-transportation workers, like Saxon and other cargo loaders, who do not ride aboard an airplane in interstate or foreign transit.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,64,"Southwest's application of ejusdem generis is as flawed as Saxon's. It purports to import a limitation from the definition of seamen into the definition of railroad employees and then engrafts that limit onto the catchall provision. But  by conceding that railroad employees is ambiguous, Southwest sinks its own ejusdem generis argument. Again, the inference embodied in ejusdem generis is that Congress remained focused on some common attribute shared by the preceding list of specific items when it used the catchall phrase. Ali, 552 U.S. at 225, 128 S.Ct. 831. By recognizing that the term railroad employees is at most ambiguous, Southwest in effect concedes that it does not necessarily share the attribute that Southwest would like us to read into the catchall provision. Ejusdem generis neither demands nor permits that we limit a broadly worded catchall phrase based on an attribute that inheres in only one of the list's preceding specific terms.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,65,"Second, Southwest argues that cargo loading is similar to other activities that this Court has found to lack a necessary nexus to interstate commerce in other contexts. But the cases Southwest invokes all addressed activities far more removed from interstate commerce than physically loading cargo directly on and off an airplane headed out of State. In Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 95 S.Ct. 392, 42 L.Ed.2d 378 (1974), for instance, this Court held that a firm making intrastate sales of asphalt was not engaged in interstate commerce, id., at 194, 95 S.Ct. 392 (internal quotation marks omitted), merely because the asphalt was later used to make interstate highways, id. at 198, 95 S.Ct. 392. Being only perceptibly connected to  instrumentalities of interstate commerce was not enough. Ibid. Similarly, in United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U.S. 271, 95 S.Ct. 2150, 45 L.Ed.2d 177 (1975), this Court held that simply supplying localized janitorial services to a corporation engaged in interstate commerce does not satisfy the `in commerce' requirement in § 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 18. 422 U.S. at 283, 95 S.Ct. 2150. In each case, the Court explained that the relevant firm was not engaged in interstate commerce because it did not perform activities within the flow of interstate commerce. Id. at 276, 95 S.Ct. 2150 (internal quotation marks omitted), Gulf Oil, 419 U.S. at 195, 95 S.Ct. 392.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,66,"But unlike those who sell asphalt for intrastate construction or those who clean up after corporate employees, our case law makes clear that airplane cargo loaders plainly do perform activities within the flow of interstate commerce when they handle goods traveling in interstate and foreign commerce, either to load them for air travel or to unload them when they arrive. See Burtch, 263 U.S. at 544, 44 S.Ct. 165.",Thomas,0,
2021-057,67,"Third, Southwest falls back on statutory purpose. It observes that § 2 of the FAA broadly requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce, while § 1 provides only a narrower exemption. This structure, in its view, demonstrates the FAA's proarbitration purposes and counsels in favor of an interpretation that errs on the side of fewer § 1 exemptions.

Sometimes, they engage in months, or even years, of litigation—filing motions to dismiss, answering complaints, and discussing settlement—before deciding they would fare better in arbitration. When that happens, the court faces a question: Has the defendant's request to switch to arbitration come too late?",Kagan,0,
2021-058,26,"Most Courts of Appeals have answered that question by applying a rule of waiver specific to the arbitration context. Usually, a federal court deciding whether a litigant has waived a right does not ask if its actions caused harm.

Under that statute, employers must pay overtime to covered employees who work more than 40 hours in a week. See 29 U.S.C. § 207(a).

But Morgan declined the invitation to litigate differently, and the District Court denied Sundance's motion. Sundance then answered Morgan's complaint, asserting 14 affirmative defenses —but none mentioning the arbitration agreement.

The panel majority reasoned that the parties had not yet begun formal discovery or contested any matters going to the merits. 992 F.3d at 715. Judge Colloton dissented. He argued that Sundance had led Morgan to waste time and money opposing the motion to dismiss and engaging in a fruitless mediation. Id., at 717. More fundamentally, he raised doubts about the Eighth Circuit's prejudice requirement. Outside the arbitration context, Judge Colloton observed, prejudice is not needed for waiver. See id., at 716. In line with that general principle, he continued, some circuits allow a finding of waiver of arbitration without a showing of prejudice. Id., at 716-717.",Kagan,0,

Nine circuits, including the Eighth, have invoked the strong federal policy favoring arbitration in support of an arbitration-specific waiver rule demanding a showing of prejudice.1 Two circuits have rejected that rule.2 We do too.",Kagan,0,
2021-058,38,"We decide today a single issue, responsive to the predominant analysis in the Courts of Appeals, rather than to all the arguments the parties have raised. In their briefing, the parties have disagreed about the role state law might play in resolving when a party's litigation conduct results in the loss of a contractual right to arbitrate. The parties have also quarreled about whether to understand that inquiry as involving rules of waiver, forfeiture, estoppel, laches, or procedural timeliness. We do not address those issues. The Courts of Appeals, including the Eighth Circuit, have generally resolved cases like this one as a matter of federal law, using the terminology of waiver. For today, we assume without deciding they are right to do so. We consider only the next step in their reasoning: that they may create arbitration-specific variants of federal procedural rules, like those concerning waiver, based on the FAA's policy favoring arbitration. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). They cannot. For that reason, the Eighth Circuit was wrong  to condition a waiver of the right to arbitrate on a showing of prejudice.",Kagan,0,
2021-058,39,"Outside the arbitration context, a federal court assessing waiver does not generally ask about prejudice. Waiver, we have said, is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). To decide whether a waiver has occurred, the court focuses on the actions of the person who held the right, the court seldom considers the effects of those actions on the opposing party. That analysis applies to the waiver of a contractual right, as of any other. As Judge Colloton noted in dissent below, a contractual waiver normally is effective without proof of detrimental reliance. 992 F.3d at 716, see Cabinetree of Wisconsin, Inc. v. Kraftmaid Cabinetry, Inc., 50 F.3d 388, 390 (C.A.7 1995) (Posner, C. J., for the Court). So in demanding that kind of proof before finding the waiver of an arbitration right, the Eighth Circuit applies a rule found nowhere else—consider it a bespoke rule of waiver for arbitration.",Kagan,0,
2021-058,40,"The Eighth Circuit's arbitration-specific rule derives from a decades-old Second Circuit decision, which in turn grounded the rule in the FAA's policy. See Carcich v. Rederi A/B Nordie, 389 F.2d 692, 696 (C.A.2 1968), Erdman, 650 F.3d at 1120, n. 4 (tracing the origins of the Eighth Circuit's prejudice requirement to Carcich). There is, the Second Circuit declared, an overriding federal policy favoring arbitration. Carcich, 389 F.2d at 696. For that reason, the court held, waiver of the right to arbitrate is not to be lightly inferred: Mere delay in seeking a stay of litigation, without some resultant prejudice to the opposing party, cannot carry the day. Ibid. Over the years, both that rule and its reasoning spread. Circuit after circuit (with just a couple of holdouts) justified adopting a prejudice requirement based on the liberal national policy favoring arbitration. Carolina Throwing Co. v. S & E Novelty Corp., 442 F.2d 329, 331 (C.A.4 1971) (per curiam), see, e.g., Paine-Webber Inc. v. Faragalli, 61 F.3d 1063, 1068-1069 (C.A.3 1995), Shinto Shipping Co. v. Fibrex & Shipping Co., Inc., 572 F.2d 1328, 1330 (C.A.9 1978).",Kagan,0,
2021-058,41,"But the FAA's policy favoring arbitration does not authorize federal courts to invent special, arbitration-preferring procedural rules. Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 24, 103 S.Ct. 927. Our frequent use of that phrase connotes something different. The policy, we have explained, is merely an acknowledgment of the FAA's commitment to overrule the judiciary's longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts. Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U.S. 287, 302, 130 S.Ct. 2847, 177 L.Ed.2d 567 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or in another formulation: The policy is to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts, but not more so. Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 404, n. 12, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967). Accordingly, a court must hold a party to its arbitration contract just as the court would to any other kind. But a court may not devise novel rules to favor arbitration over litigation. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 218-221, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). If an ordinary procedural rule—whether of waiver or forfeiture or what-have-you— would counsel against enforcement of an arbitration contract, then so be it. The federal policy is about treating arbitration contracts like all others, not about fostering arbitration. See ibid., National Foundation for Cancer Research v. A. G. Edwards  & Sons, Inc., 821 F.2d 772, 774 (C.A.D.C. 1987) (The Supreme Court has made clear that the FAA's policy is based upon the enforcement of contract, rather than a preference for arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism).",Kagan,0,
2021-058,42,"And indeed, the text of the FAA makes clear that courts are not to create arbitration-specific procedural rules like the one we address here. Section 6 of the FAA provides that any application under the statute—including an application to stay litigation or compel arbitration— shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of motions (unless the statute says otherwise). A directive to a federal court to treat arbitration applications in the manner provided by law for all other motions is simply a command to apply the usual federal procedural rules, including any rules relating to a motion's timeliness. Or put conversely, it is a bar on using custom-made rules, to tilt the playing field in favor of (or against) arbitration. As explained above, the usual federal rule of waiver does not include a prejudice requirement. So Section 6 instructs that prejudice is not a condition of finding that a party, by litigating too long, waived its right to stay litigation or compel arbitration under the FAA.",Kagan,0,
2021-058,43,"Stripped of its prejudice requirement, the Eighth Circuit's current waiver inquiry would focus on Sundance's conduct. Did Sundance, as the rest of the Eighth Circuit's test asks, knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with that right? See supra, at 1711-1712. On remand, the Court of Appeals may resolve that question, or (as indicated above) determine that a different procedural framework (such as forfeiture) is appropriate. See supra, at 1712. Our sole holding today is that it may not make up a new procedural rule based on the FAA's policy favoring arbitration.* * *",Kagan,0,

2021-059,54,The key phrase for purposes of this case is foreign or international tribunal.,Barrett,0,
2021-059,55,"Standing alone, the word tribunal casts little light on the question. It can be used as a synonym for court, in which case it carries a distinctively governmental flavor. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 1677 (4th ed. rev. 1968) (the seat of a judge or a judicial court, the jurisdiction which the judges exercise). But it can also be used more broadly to refer to any adjudicatory body. See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 1369 (1969) (anything having the power of determining or judging). Here, statutory history indicates that Congress used tribunal in the broader sense. A prior version of § 1782 covered any judicial proceeding in any court in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. § 1782 (1958 ed.), but in 1964, Congress expanded the provision to cover proceedings in a foreign or international tribunal. As we have previously observed, that shift created `the possibility of U.S. judicial assistance in connection with administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings abroad.' Intel, 542 U.S. at 258, 124 S.Ct. 2466 (alterations omitted). So a § 1782 tribunal need not be a formal court, and the broad meaning of tribunal does not itself exclude private adjudicatory bodies.1 If we had nothing but this single word to go on, there would be a good case for including private arbitral panels.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,56,"This is where context comes in. Tribunal does not stand alone—it belongs to the phrase foreign or international tribunal. And attached to these modifiers, tribunal is best understood as an adjudicative body that exercises governmental authority.2 Cf. FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 406, 131 S.Ct. 1177, 179 L.Ed.2d 132 (2011) (Two words together may assume a more particular meaning than those words in isolation).",Barrett,0,
2021-059,57,"Take foreign tribunal first. Congress could have used foreign in one of two ways here. It could mean something like belonging to another nation or country, which would support reading foreign tribunal as a governmental body. Black's Law Dictionary, at 775. Or it could more generally mean from another country, which would sweep in private adjudicative bodies too. See, e.g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 555 (1966) (derived from another country or nation, not native). The first meaning is the better fit.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,58,"The word foreign takes on its more governmental meaning when modifying a word with potential governmental or sovereign connotations. That is why foreign suggests something different in the phrase foreign leader than it does in foreign films. Brief for Petitioners in No. 21-401, pp. 20-21, Brief for Respondent in No. 21-401, pp. 7-8. The phrase foreign leader brings to mind an official of a foreign  state, not a team captain of a European football club. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17. So too with foreign tribunal. Tribunal is a word with potential governmental or sovereign connotations, so foreign tribunal more naturally refers to a tribunal belonging to a foreign nation than to a tribunal that is simply located in a foreign nation. And for a tribunal to belong to a foreign nation, the tribunal must possess sovereign authority conferred by that nation. See id., at 14-15 (a governmental adjudicator is one whose role in deciding the dispute rests on a nation's sovereign authority).",Barrett,0,
2021-059,59,"This reading of foreign tribunal is reinforced by the statutory defaults for discovery procedure. In addition to authorizing district courts to order testimony or the production of evidence, § 1782 permits them to prescribe the practice and procedure, which may be in whole or part the practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal, for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other thing. § 1782(a) (emphasis added). The reference to the procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal parallels the authorization for district courts to grant discovery for use in a foreign or international tribunal mentioned just before in § 1782. The statute thus presumes that a foreign tribunal follows the practice and procedure of the foreign country. It is unremarkable for the statute to presume that a foreign court, quasi-judicial body, or any other governmental adjudicatory body follows the practice and procedures prescribed by the government that conferred authority on it.3 But that would be an odd assumption to make about a private adjudicatory body, which is typically the creature of an agreement between private parties who prescribe their own rules. See Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.S. 662, 683, 130 S.Ct. 1758, 176 L.Ed.2d 605 (2010). That the default discovery procedures for a foreign tribunal are governmental suggests that the body is governmental too.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,60,"Now for international tribunal. International can mean either (1) involving or of two or more nations, or (2) involving or of two or more nationalities. American Heritage Dictionary, at 685 (of, relating to, or involving two or more nations or nationalities), see also Random House Dictionary, at 743 (between or among nations, involving two or more nations, of or pertaining to two or more nations or their citizens). The latter definition is unlikely in this context because an adjudicative body would be international if it had adjudicators of different nationalities —and it would be strange for the availability of discovery to turn on the national origin of the adjudicators. So no party argues that international carries that meaning here. A tribunal is international when it involves or is of two or more nations, meaning that those nations have imbued the tribunal with official power to adjudicate disputes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 77 (the United States arguing that the touchstone is whether the body is exercising official power on behalf of the two governments).",Barrett,0,
2021-059,61,"So understood, foreign tribunal and international tribunal complement one another, the former is a tribunal imbued with governmental authority by one nation, and the latter is a tribunal imbued with governmental authority by multiple nations.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,63,"Section 1782's focus on governmental and intergovernmental tribunals is confirmed by both the statute's history and a comparison to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,64,"From the start, the statute has been about respecting foreign nations and the governmental and intergovernmental bodies they create. From 1855 until 1964, § 1782 and its antecedents covered assistance only to foreign courts. See Act of Mar. 2, 1855, ch. 140, § 2, 10 Stat. 630, Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 95, § 1, 12 Stat. 769, Act of Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, § 875, 19 Stat. 241, Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, § 1782, 62 Stat. 949, 28 U.S.C. § 1782 (1958 ed.). And before 1964, a separate strand of law covered assistance to `any international tribunal or commission  in which the United States participated as a party.' Act of June 7, 1933, ch. 50, 48 Stat. 117. The process of combining these two statutory lines began when Congress established the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure. See Act of Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. 85-906, §§ 1-2, 72 Stat. 1743. It charged the Commission with improving the process of judicial assistance, specifying that the assistance and cooperation was between the United States and foreign countries and that the rendering of assistance to foreign courts and quasi-judicial agencies should be improved. Ibid. (emphasis added). In 1964, Congress adopted the Commission's proposed legislation, which became the modern version of § 1782.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,65,"Interpreting § 1782 to reach only bodies exercising governmental authority is consistent with Congress' charge to the Commission. Seen in light of the statutory history, the amendment did not signal an expansion from public to private bodies, but rather an expansion of the types of public bodies covered. By broadening the range of governmental and intergovernmental bodies included in § 1782, Congress increased the assistance and cooperation rendered by the United States to those nations.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,66,"After all, the animating purpose of § 1782 is comity: Permitting federal courts to assist foreign and international governmental bodies promotes respect for foreign governments and encourages reciprocal assistance. It is difficult to see how enlisting district courts to help private bodies would serve that end. Such a broad reading of § 1782 would open district court doors to any interested person seeking assistance for proceedings before any private adjudicative body—a category broad enough to include everything from a commercial arbitration panel to a university's student disciplinary tribunal. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 21-401, at 19. Why would Congress lend the resources of district courts to aid purely private bodies adjudicating purely private disputes abroad?",Barrett,0,
2021-059,67,"Extending § 1782 to include private bodies would also be in significant tension with the FAA, which governs domestic arbitration, because § 1782 permits much broader discovery than the FAA allows. Among other differences, the FAA permits only the arbitration panel to request discovery, see 9 U.S.C. § 7, while district courts can entertain § 1782 requests from foreign or international tribunals or any interested person, 28 U.S.C. § 1782(a). In addition, prearbitration discovery is off the table under the FAA but broadly available under § 1782. See Intel, 542 U.S. at 259, 124 S.Ct. 2466 (holding that discovery is available for use in proceedings within reasonable contemplation). Interpreting § 1782 to reach private arbitration would therefore create a notable mismatch between foreign and domestic arbitration. And as the Seventh Circuit observed, it's hard to conjure a rationale  for giving parties to private foreign arbitrations such broad access to federal-court discovery assistance in the United States while precluding such discovery assistance for litigants in domestic arbitrations. Rolls-Royce, 975 F.3d at 695.* * *",Barrett,0,
2021-059,68,"In sum, we hold that § 1782 requires a foreign or international tribunal to be governmental or intergovernmental. Thus, a foreign tribunal is one that exercises governmental authority conferred by a single nation, and an international tribunal is one that exercises governmental authority conferred by two or more nations. Private adjudicatory bodies do not fall within § 1782.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,70,That leaves the question whether the adjudicative bodies in the cases before us are governmental or intergovernmental. They are not.,Barrett,0,
2021-059,72,"Analyzing the status of the arbitral panel involved in Luxshare's dispute with ZF is straightforward. Private parties agreed in a private contract that DIS, a private dispute-resolution organization, would arbitrate any disputes between them. See Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 682, 130 S.Ct. 1758 (An arbitrator derives his or her powers from the parties' agreement to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution). By default, DIS panels operate under DIS rules, just like panels of any other private arbitration organization operate under private arbitral rules. The panels are formed by the parties—with each party selecting one arbitrator and those two arbitrators choosing a third. No government is involved in creating the DIS panel or prescribing its procedures. This adjudicative body therefore does not qualify as a governmental body.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,73,"Luxshare weakly suggests that a commercial arbitral panel like the DIS panel qualifies as governmental so long as the law of the country in which it would sit (here, Germany) governs some aspects of arbitration and courts play a role in enforcing arbitration agreements. See Brief for Respondent in No. 21-401, at 26-27, Boeing, 954 F.3d at 213-214. But private entities do not become governmental because laws govern them and courts enforce their contracts—that would erase any distinction between private and governmental adjudicative bodies. Luxshare's implausibly broad definition of a governmental adjudicative body is nothing but an attempted end run around § 1782's limit.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,75,"The ad hoc arbitration panel at issue in the Fund's dispute with Lithuania presents a harder question. A sovereign is on one side of the dispute, and the option to arbitrate is contained in an international treaty rather than a private contract. These factors, which the Fund emphasizes, offer some support for the argument that the ad hoc panel is intergovernmental. Yet neither Lithuania's presence nor the treaty's existence is dispositive, because Russia and Lithuania are free to structure investor-state dispute resolution as they see fit. What matters is the substance of their agreement: Did these two nations intend to confer governmental authority on an ad hoc panel formed pursuant to the treaty? See BG Group plc v. Republic of Argentina, 572 U.S. 25, 37, 134 S.Ct. 1198, 188 L.Ed.2d 220 (2014) (As a general matter, a treaty is a contract, though between nations, and its interpretation normally is, like a contract's interpretation, a matter of determining the parties' intent).",Barrett,0,

2021-059,81,"The options on this menu vary in form. For example, a competent court or court of arbitration of the Contracting Party (i.e., the state in which an investor does business) is clearly governmental, a court of a sovereign belongs to that sovereign. The inclusion of courts on the list reflects Russia and Lithuania's intent to give investors the choice of bringing their disputes before a pre-existing governmental body.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,82,"An ad hoc arbitration panel, by contrast, is not a pre-existing body, but one formed for the purpose of adjudicating investor-state disputes. And nothing in the treaty reflects Russia and Lithuania's intent that an ad hoc panel exercise governmental authority. For instance, the treaty does not itself create the panel, instead, it simply references the set of rules that govern the panel's formation and procedure if an investor chooses that forum. In addition, the ad hoc panel functions independently of and is not affiliated with either Lithuania or Russia. 5 F.4th at 226. It consists of individuals chosen by the parties and lacking any official affiliation with Lithuania, Russia, or any other governmental or intergovernmental entity. Ibid. And it lacks other possible indicia of a governmental nature. See ibid. (The panel receives zero government funding, the proceedings maintain confidentiality, and the `award may be made public only with the consent of both parties').4",Barrett,0,
2021-059,83,"Indeed, the ad hoc panel at issue in the Fund's dispute with Lithuania is materially indistinguishable in form and function from the DIS panel resolving the dispute between ZF and Luxshare. Brief for George A. Bermann et al. as Amici Curiae 19. In a private arbitration, the panel derives its authority from the parties' consent to arbitrate. The ad hoc panel in this case derives its authority in essentially the same way. Russia and Lithuania each agreed in the treaty to submit to ad hoc arbitration if an investor chose it. The Fund took Lithuania up on that offer by initiating such an arbitration, thereby triggering the formation of an ad hoc panel with the authority to resolve the parties' dispute. That authority exists because Lithuania and the Fund consented to the arbitration, not because Russia and Lithuania clothed the panel with governmental authority. Cf. Granite Rock Co. v.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,84,"Teamsters, 561 U.S. 287, 299, 130 S.Ct. 2847, 177 L.Ed.2d 567 (2010) (The first principle that underscores all of our arbitration decisions is that arbitration is strictly `a matter of consent'), AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 648-649, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986) (Arbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration). So inclusion in the treaty does not, as the Fund suggests, automatically render ad hoc arbitration governmental. Instead, it reflects the countries' choice to offer investors the potentially appealing option of bringing their disputes to a private arbitration panel that operates like commercial arbitration panels do. In a treaty designed to attract foreign investors by offering favourable conditions for investments, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 21-518, at 56a, that choice makes sense.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,85,"None of this forecloses the possibility that sovereigns might imbue an ad hoc arbitration panel with official authority. Governmental and intergovernmental bodies may take many forms, and we do not attempt to prescribe how they should be structured. The point is only that a body does not possess governmental authority just because nations agree in a treaty to submit to arbitration before it. The relevant question is whether the nations intended that the ad hoc panel exercise governmental authority. And here, all indications are that they did not.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,86,"The Fund tries to bolster its case by analogizing to past adjudicatory bodies: (1) the body at issue in the dispute over the sinking of the Canadian ship I'm Alone, which derived from a treaty between the United States and Great Britain, and (2) the United States-Germany Mixed Claims Commission. There appears to be broad consensus that these bodies would qualify as intergovernmental. Ergo, the Fund says, the ad hoc panel must be intergovernmental too.",Barrett,0,
2021-059,87,"This does not follow. It is not dispositive whether an adjudicative body shares some features of other bodies that look governmental. Instead, the inquiry is whether those features and other evidence establish the intent of the relevant nations to imbue the body in question with governmental authority. And though we need not decide the status of the I'm Alone and Mixed Claims commissions, it is worth noting some differences between the treaties providing for them and the treaty at issue here. For instance, those treaties specified that each sovereign would be involved in the formation of the bodies, and, with respect to the treaty creating the Mixed Claims Commission in particular, it also specified where the commission would initially meet, the method of funding, and that the commissioners could appoint other officers to assist in the proceedings. See Convention Between the United States and Great Britain for Prevention of Smuggling of Intoxicating Liquors, Art. IV, Jan. 23, 1924, 43 Stat. 1761-1762, T. S.

Mr. Kennedy prayed during a period when school employees were free to speak with a friend, call for a reservation at a restaurant, check email, or attend to other personal matters. He offered his prayers quietly while his students were otherwise occupied. Still, the Bremerton School District disciplined him anyway. It  did so because it thought anything less could lead a reasonable observer to conclude (mistakenly) that it endorsed Mr. Kennedy's religious beliefs. That reasoning was misguided. Both the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy's. Nor does a proper understanding of the Amendment's Establishment Clause require the government to single out private religious speech for special disfavor. The Constitution and the best of our traditions counsel mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,35,"Joseph Kennedy began working as a football coach at Bremerton High School in 2008 after nearly two decades of service in the Marine Corps. App. 167. Like many other football players and coaches across the country, Mr. Kennedy made it a practice to give thanks through prayer on the playing field at the conclusion of each game. Id., at 168, 171. In his prayers, Mr. Kennedy sought to express gratitude for what the players had accomplished and for the opportunity to be part of their lives through the game of football. Id., at 168. Mr. Kennedy offered his prayers after the players and coaches had shaken hands, by taking a knee at the 50-yard line and praying quietly for approximately 30 seconds. Id., at 168-169.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,36,"Initially, Mr. Kennedy prayed on his own. See ibid. But over time, some players asked whether they could pray alongside him. 991 F.3d 1004, 1010 (C.A.9 2021), App. 169. Mr. Kennedy responded by saying, `This is a free country. You can do what you want.' Ibid. The number of players who joined Mr. Kennedy eventually grew to include most of the team, at least after some games. Sometimes team members invited opposing players to join. Other times Mr. Kennedy still prayed alone. See ibid. Eventually, Mr. Kennedy began incorporating short motivational speeches with his prayer when others were present. See id., at 170. Separately, the team at times engaged in pregame or postgame prayers in the locker room. It seems this practice was a school tradition that predated Mr. Kennedy's tenure. Ibid. Mr. Kennedy explained that he never told any student that it was important they participate in any religious activity. Ibid. In particular, he never pressured or encouraged any student to join his postgame midfield prayers. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,37,"For over seven years, no one complained to the Bremerton School District (District) about these practices. See id., at 63-64. It seems the District's superintendent first learned of them only in September 2015, after an employee from another school commented positively on the school's practices to Bremerton's principal. See id., at 109, 229. At that point, the District reacted quickly. On September 17, the superintendent sent Mr. Kennedy a letter. In it, the superintendent identified two problematic practices in which Mr. Kennedy had engaged. App. 40. First, Mr. Kennedy had provided inspirational talks that included overtly religious references likely constituting prayer with the students at midfield following the completion of  games. Ibid. Second, he had led students and coaching staff in a prayer in the locker-room tradition that predated his involvement with the program. Id., at 41.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,38,"The District explained that it sought to establish clear parameters going forward. Ibid. It instructed Mr. Kennedy to avoid any motivational talks with students that included religious expression, including prayer, and to avoid suggesting, encouraging (or discouraging),  or supervising any prayers of students, which students remained free to engage in. Id., at 44. The District also explained that any religious activity on Mr. Kennedy's part must be nondemonstrative (i.e., not outwardly discernible as religious activity) if students are also engaged in religious conduct in order to avoid the perception of endorsement. Id., at 45. In offering these directives, the District appealed to what it called a direct tension between the Establishment Clause and a school employee's right to freely exercise his religion. Id., at 43. To resolve that tension, the District explained, an employee's free exercise rights must yield so far as necessary to avoid school endorsement of religious activities. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,39,"After receiving the District's September 17 letter, Mr. Kennedy ended the tradition, predating him, of offering locker-room prayers. Id., at 40-41, 77, 170-172. He also ended his practice of incorporating religious references or prayer into his postgame motivational talks to his team on the field. See ibid. Mr. Kennedy further felt pressured to abandon his practice of saying his own quiet, on-field postgame prayer. See id., at 172. Driving home after a game, however, Mr. Kennedy felt upset that he had broken his commitment to God by not offering his own prayer, so he turned his car around and returned to the field. Ibid. By that point, everyone had left the stadium, and he walked to the 50-yard line and knelt to say a brief prayer of thanks. See ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,40,"On October 14, through counsel, Mr. Kennedy sent a letter to school officials informing them that, because of his sincerely-held religious beliefs, he felt compelled to offer a post-game personal prayer of thanks at midfield. Id., at 62-63, 172. He asked the District to allow him to continue that private religious expression alone. Id., at 62. Consistent with the District's policy, see id., at 48, Mr. Kennedy explained that he neither requests, encourages, nor discourages students from participating in these prayers, id., at 64. Mr. Kennedy emphasized that he sought only the opportunity to wait until the game is over and the players have left the field and then walk to mid-field to say a short, private, personal prayer. Id., at 69. He told everybody that it would be acceptable to him to pray when the kids went away from him. Id., at 292. He later clarified that this meant he was even willing to say his prayer while the players were walking to the locker room or bus, and then catch up with his team. Id., at 280-282, see also id., at 59. However, Mr. Kennedy objected to the logical implication of the District's September 17 letter, which he understood as banning him from bowing his head in the vicinity of students, and as requiring him to flee the scene if students voluntarily came to the same area where he was praying. Id., at 70. After all, District policy prohibited him from discouraging independent student decisions to pray. Id., at 44.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,41,"On October 16, shortly before the game that day, the District responded with another letter. See id., at 76. The District acknowledged that Mr. Kennedy had complied with the directives in its September 17 letter. Id., at 77. Yet instead of accommodating Mr. Kennedy's request to offer a brief prayer on the field while students were busy with other activities— whether heading to the locker room, boarding the bus, or perhaps singing the school fight song—the District issued an ultimatum. It forbade Mr. Kennedy from engaging in any overt actions that could appear to a reasonable observer to endorse prayer  while he is on duty as a District-paid coach. Id., at 81. The District did so because it judged that anything  less would lead it to violate the Establishment Clause. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,43,"After receiving this letter, Mr. Kennedy offered a brief prayer following the October 16 game. See id., at 90. When he bowed his head at midfield after the game, most Bremerton players were  engaged in the traditional singing of the school fight song to the audience. Ibid. Though Mr. Kennedy was alone when he began to pray, players from the other team and members of the community joined him before he finished his prayer. See id., at 82, 297.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,44,"This event spurred media coverage of Mr. Kennedy's dilemma and a public response from the District. The District placed robocalls to parents to inform them that public access to the field is forbidden, it posted signs and made announcements at games saying the same thing, and it had the Bremerton Police secure the field in future games. Id., at 100-101, 354-355. Subsequently, the District superintendent explained in an October 20 email to the leader of a state association of school administrators that the coach moved on from leading prayer with kids, to taking a silent prayer at the 50 yard line. Id., at 83. The official with whom the superintendent corresponded acknowledged that the use of a silent prayer changes the equation a bit. Ibid. On October 21, the superintendent further observed to a state official that the issue is quickly changing as it has shifted from leading prayer with student athletes, to a coaches sic right to conduct his own prayer on the 50 yard line. Id., at 88.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,45,"On October 23, shortly before that evening's game, the District wrote Mr. Kennedy again. It expressed appreciation for his efforts to comply with the District's directives, including avoiding on-the-job prayer with players in the  football program, both in the locker room prior to games as well as on the field immediately following games. Id., at 90. The letter also admitted that, during Mr. Kennedy's recent October 16 postgame prayer, his students were otherwise engaged and not praying with him, and that his prayer was fleeting. Id., at 90, 93. Still, the District explained that a reasonable observer could think government endorsement of religion had occurred when a District employee, on the field only by virtue of his employment with the District, still on duty engaged in overtly religious conduct. Id., at 91, 93. The District thus made clear that the only option it would offer Mr. Kennedy was to allow him to pray after a game in a private location behind closed doors and not observable to students or the public. Id., at 93-94.",Gorsuch,0,

The superintendent informed the District's board that this prayer moved closer to what we want, but nevertheless remained unconstitutional. Id., at 96. After the final relevant football game on October 26, Mr. Kennedy again knelt alone to offer a brief prayer as the players engaged in postgame traditions. 443 F.Supp.3d 1223, 1231 (W.D.

Id., at 102. The letter did not allege that Mr. Kennedy performed these prayers with students, and it acknowledged that his prayers took place while students were engaged in unrelated postgame activities.

The Q&A also acknowledged that Mr. Kennedy had complied with the District's instruction to refrain from his prior practices of leading players in a pre-game prayer in the locker room or leading players in a post-game prayer immediately following games. Ibid. But the Q&A asserted that the District could not allow Mr. Kennedy to engage in a public religious display. Id., at 105, 107, 110.

2021-061,54,"Following the Ninth Circuit's ruling, Mr. Kennedy sought certiorari in this Court. The Court denied the petition.

Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist., 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 634, 635, 203 L.Ed.2d 137 (2019). Justice ALITO expressed concerns with the lower courts' decisions, including the possibility that, under their reasoning, teachers might be ordered not to engage in any `demonstrative' conduct of a religious nature within view of students, even to the point of being forbidden from folding their hands or bowing their heads in prayer before lunch. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 636.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,56,"After the case returned to the District Court, the parties engaged in discovery and eventually brought cross-motions for summary judgment. At the end of that process, the District Court found that the `sole reason' for the District's decision to suspend Mr. Kennedy was its perceived risk of constitutional liability under the Establishment Clause for his religious conduct after the October 16, 23, and 26 games. 443 F.Supp.3d at 1231.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,57,"The court found that reason persuasive too. Rejecting Mr. Kennedy's free speech claim, the court concluded that because Mr. Kennedy was hired precisely to occupy an influential role for student athletes, any speech he uttered was offered in his capacity as a government employee and unprotected by the First Amendment. Id., at 1237. Alternatively, even if Mr. Kennedy's speech qualified as private speech, the District Court reasoned, the District properly suppressed it. Had it done otherwise, the District would have invited an Establishment Clause violation. Ibid. Turning to Mr. Kennedy's free exercise claim, the District Court held that, even if the District's policies restricting his religious exercise were not neutral toward religion or generally applicable, the District had a compelling interest in prohibiting his postgame prayers, because, once more, had it allowed them it would have violated the Establishment Clause. Id., at 1240.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,59,"The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed with the District Court that Mr. Kennedy's speech qualified as government rather than private speech because his expression on the field—a location that he only had access to because of his employment— during a time when he was generally tasked with communicating with students, was speech as a government employee. 991 F.3d at 1015. Like the District Court, the Ninth Circuit further reasoned that, even if we were to assume  that Kennedy spoke as a private citizen, the District had an adequate justification for its actions. Id., at 1016. According to the court, Kennedy's on-field religious activity, coupled with what the court called his pugilistic efforts to generate publicity in order to gain approval of those on-field religious activities, were enough to lead an objective observer to conclude that the District endorsed Kennedy's religious activity by not stopping the practice. Id., at 1017-1018. And that, the court held, would amount to a violation of the Establishment Clause. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,60,"The Court of Appeals rejected Mr. Kennedy's free exercise claim for similar reasons. The District conceded that its policy that led to Mr. Kennedy's suspension was not neutral and generally applicable and instead restricted Kennedy's religious conduct because the conduct was religious. Id., at 1020. Still, the court ruled, the District had a compelling state interest to avoid violating the Establishment Clause, and its suspension was narrowly tailored to vindicate that interest.

2021-061,61,"Later, the Ninth Circuit denied a petition to rehear the case en banc over the dissents of 11 judges. 4 F.4th 910, 911 (2021). Among other things, the dissenters argued that the panel erred by holding that a failure to discipline Mr. Kennedy would have led the District to violate the Establishment Clause. Several dissenters noted that the panel's analysis rested on Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), and its progeny for the proposition that the Establishment Clause is implicated whenever a hypothetical reasonable observer could conclude the government endorses religion.",Gorsuch,0,

2021-061,64,"Now before us, Mr. Kennedy renews his argument that the District's conduct violated both the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. These Clauses work in tandem. Where the Free Exercise Clause protects religious exercises, whether communicative or not, the Free Speech Clause provides overlapping protection for expressive religious activities. See, e.g., Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 269, n. 6, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 841, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995). That the First Amendment doubly protects religious speech is no accident. It is a natural outgrowth of the framers' distrust of government attempts to regulate religion and suppress dissent. See, e.g., A Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, in Selected Writings of James Madison 21, 25 (R. Ketcham ed. 2006). In Anglo-American history,  government suppression of speech has so commonly been directed precisely at religious speech that a free-speech clause without religion would be Hamlet without the prince.

2021-061,69,"That Mr. Kennedy has discharged his burdens is effectively undisputed. No one questions that he seeks to engage in a sincerely motivated religious exercise. The exercise in question involves, as Mr. Kennedy has put it, giving thanks through prayer briefly and by himself on the playing field at the conclusion of each game he coaches. App. 168, 171. Mr. Kennedy has indicated repeatedly that he is willing to wait until the game is over and the players have left the field to walk to mid-field to say his short, private, personal prayer. Id., at 69, see also id., at 280, 282. The contested exercise before us does not involve leading prayers with the team or before any other captive audience. Mr. Kennedy's religious beliefs do not require him to lead any prayer involving students. Id., at 170. At the District's request, he voluntarily discontinued the school tradition of locker-room prayers and his postgame religious talks to students. The District disciplined him only for his decision to persist in praying quietly without his players after three games in October 2015. See Parts I-B and I-C, supra.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,70,"Nor does anyone question that, in forbidding Mr. Kennedy's brief prayer, the District failed to act pursuant to a neutral and generally applicable rule. A government policy will not qualify as neutral if it is specifically directed at  religious practice. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595. A policy can fail this test if it discriminates on its face, or if a religious exercise is otherwise its object. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533, 113 S.Ct. 2217, see also Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.Ct. 1595. A government policy will fail the general applicability requirement if it prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government's asserted interests in a similar way, or if it provides a mechanism for individualized exemptions. Fulton, 593 U. S., at ___, 141 S.Ct., at 1877. Failing either the neutrality or general applicability test is sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,71,"In this case, the District's challenged policies were neither neutral nor generally applicable. By its own admission, the District sought to restrict Mr. Kennedy's actions at least in part because of their religious character. As it put it in its September 17 letter, the District prohibited any overt actions on Mr. Kennedy's part, appearing to a reasonable observer to endorse even voluntary, student-initiated prayer. App. 81. The District further explained  that it could not allow an employee, while still on duty, to engage in religious conduct. Id., at 106 (emphasis added). Prohibiting a religious practice was thus the District's unquestioned object. The District candidly acknowledged as much below, conceding that its policies were not neutral toward religion. 991 F.3d at 1020.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,72,"The District's challenged policies also fail the general applicability test. The District's performance evaluation after the 2015 football season advised against rehiring Mr. Kennedy on the ground that he failed to supervise student-athletes after games. App. 114. But, in fact, this was a bespoke requirement specifically addressed to Mr. Kennedy's religious exercise. The District permitted other members of the coaching staff to forgo supervising students briefly after the game to do things like visit with friends or take personal phone calls. App. 205, see also Part I-B, supra. Thus, any sort of postgame supervisory requirement was not applied in an evenhanded, across-the-board way. Again recognizing as much, the District conceded before the Ninth Circuit that its challenged directives were not generally applicable. 991 F.3d at 1020.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,74,"When it comes to Mr. Kennedy's free speech claim, our precedents remind us that the First Amendment's protections extend to teachers and students, neither of whom shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), see also Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 231, 134 S.Ct. 2369, 189 L.Ed.2d 312 (2014). Of course, none of this means the speech rights of public school employees are so boundless that they may deliver any message to anyone anytime they wish. In addition to being private citizens, teachers and coaches are also government employees paid in part to speak on the government's behalf and convey its intended messages.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,75,"To account for the complexity associated with the interplay between free speech rights and government employment, this Court's decisions in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), Garcetti, 547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689, and related cases suggest proceeding in two steps. The first step involves a threshold inquiry into the nature of the speech at issue. If a public employee speaks pursuant to his or her official duties, this Court has said the Free Speech Clause generally will not shield the individual from an employer's control and discipline because that kind of speech is—for constitutional purposes at least—the government's own speech. Id., at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,76,"At the same time and at the other end of the spectrum, when an employee speaks as a citizen addressing a matter of public concern, our cases indicate that the First Amendment may be implicated and courts should proceed to a second step. Id., at 423, 126 S.Ct. 1951. At this second step, our cases suggest that courts should attempt to engage in a delicate balancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences. Ibid. Among other things, courts at this second step have sometimes considered whether an employee's speech interests are outweighed by `the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.' Id., at 417, 126 S.Ct. 1951  (quoting Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,77,"Both sides ask us to employ at least certain aspects of this Pickering-Garcetti framework to resolve Mr. Kennedy's free speech claim. They share additional common ground too. They agree that Mr. Kennedy's speech implicates a matter of public concern. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 183, Brief for Respondent 44. They also appear to accept, at least for argument's sake, that Mr. Kennedy's speech does not raise questions of academic freedom that may or may not involve additional First Amendment interests beyond those captured by this framework. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 425, 126 S.Ct. 1951, see also Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967), Brief for Petitioner 26, n. 2. At the first step of the Pickering-Garcetti inquiry, the parties' disagreement thus turns out to center on one question alone: Did Mr. Kennedy offer his prayers in his capacity as a private citizen, or did they amount to government speech attributable to the District?",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,78,"Our cases offer some helpful guidance for resolving this question. In Garcetti, the Court concluded that a prosecutor's internal memorandum to a supervisor was made pursuant to his official duties, and thus ineligible for First Amendment protection. 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on the fact that the prosecutor's speech fulfilled a responsibility to advise his supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending case. Ibid. In other words, the prosecutor's memorandum was government speech because it was speech the government itself had commissioned or created and speech the employee was expected to deliver in the course of carrying out his job. Id., at 422, 126 S.Ct. 1951.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,79,"By contrast, in Lane a public employer sought to terminate an employee after he testified at a criminal trial about matters involving his government employment. 573 U.S. at 233, 134 S.Ct. 2369. The Court held that the employee's speech was protected by the First Amendment. Id., at 231, 134 S.Ct. 2369. In doing so, the Court held that the fact the speech touched on matters related to public employment was not enough to render it government speech. Id., at 239-240, 134 S.Ct. 2369. Instead, the Court explained, the critical question is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee's duties. Id., at 240, 134 S.Ct. 2369. It is an inquiry this Court has said should be undertaken practically, rather than with a blinkered focus on the terms of some formal and capacious written job description. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 424, 126 S.Ct. 1951. To proceed otherwise would be to allow public employers to use excessively broad job descriptions to subvert the Constitution's protections. Ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,80,"Applying these lessons here, it seems clear to us that Mr. Kennedy has demonstrated that his speech was private speech, not government speech. When Mr. Kennedy uttered the three prayers that resulted in his suspension, he was not engaged in speech ordinarily within the scope of his duties as a coach. Lane, 573 U.S. at 240, 134 S.Ct. 2369. He did not speak pursuant to government policy. He was not seeking to convey a government-created message. He was not instructing players, discussing strategy, encouraging better on-field performance, or engaged in any other speech the District paid him to produce as a coach. See Part I-B, supra. Simply put: Mr. Kennedy's prayers did not owe their existence to Mr. Kennedy's responsibilities as a public employee. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,81,"The timing and circumstances of Mr. Kennedy's prayers confirm the point. During the postgame period when these prayers occurred, coaches were free to attend briefly to personal matters—everything from checking sports scores on their phones to greeting friends and family in the stands. App. 205, see Part I-B, supra. We find it unlikely that Mr. Kennedy was fulfilling a responsibility imposed by his employment by praying during a period in which the District has acknowledged that its coaching staff was free to engage in all manner of private speech. That Mr. Kennedy offered his prayers when students were engaged in other activities like singing the school fight song further suggests that those prayers were not delivered as an address to the team, but instead in his capacity as a private citizen. Nor is it dispositive that Mr. Kennedy's prayers took place within the office environment —here, on the field of play. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. Instead, what matters is whether Mr. Kennedy offered his prayers while acting within the scope of his duties as a coach. And taken together, both the substance of Mr. Kennedy's speech and the circumstances surrounding it point to the conclusion that he did not.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,82,"In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Ninth Circuit stressed that, as a coach, Mr. Kennedy served as a role model clothed with the mantle of one who imparts knowledge and wisdom. 991 F.3d at 1015. The court emphasized that Mr. Kennedy remained on duty after games. Id., at 1016. Before us, the District presses the same arguments. See Brief for Respondent 24. And no doubt they have a point. Teachers and coaches often serve as vital role models. But this argument commits the error of positing an excessively broad job description by treating everything teachers and coaches say in the workplace as government speech subject to government control. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 424, 126 S.Ct. 1951. On this understanding, a school could fire a Muslim teacher for wearing a headscarf in the classroom or prohibit a Christian aide from praying quietly over her lunch in the cafeteria. Likewise, this argument ignores the District Court's conclusion (and the District's concession) that Mr. Kennedy's actual job description left time for a private moment after the game to call home, check a text, socialize, or engage in any manner of secular activities. Others working for the District were free to engage briefly in personal speech and activity. App. 205, see Part I-B, supra. That Mr. Kennedy chose to use the same time to pray does not transform his speech into government speech. To hold differently would be to treat religious expression as second-class speech and eviscerate this Court's repeated promise that teachers do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506, 89 S.Ct. 733.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,83,"Of course, acknowledging that Mr. Kennedy's prayers represented his own private speech does not end the matter. So far, we have recognized only that Mr. Kennedy has carried his threshold burden. Under the Pickering-Garcetti framework, a second step remains where the government may seek to prove that its interests as employer outweigh even an employee's private speech on a matter of public concern. See Lane, 573 U.S. at 236, 242, 134 S.Ct. 2369.2  IV",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,84,"Whether one views the case through the lens of the Free Exercise or Free Speech Clause, at this point the burden shifts to the District. Under the Free Exercise Clause, a government entity normally must satisfy at least strict scrutiny, showing that its restrictions on the plaintiff's protected rights serve a compelling interest and are narrowly tailored to that end. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533, n. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2217, supra. A similar standard generally obtains under the Free Speech Clause. See Reed, 576 U.S. at 171, 135 S.Ct. 2218. The District, however, asks us to apply to Mr. Kennedy's claims the more lenient second-step Pickering-Garcetti test, or alternatively intermediate scrutiny. See Brief for Respondent 44-48. Ultimately, however, it does not matter which standard we apply. The District cannot sustain its burden under any of them.3",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,86,"As we have seen, the District argues that its suspension of Mr. Kennedy was essential to avoid a violation of the Establishment Clause. Id., at 35-42. On its account, Mr. Kennedy's prayers might have been protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses. But his rights were in direct tension with the competing demands of the Establishment Clause. App. 43. To resolve that clash, the District reasoned, Mr. Kennedy's rights had to yield. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit pursued this same line of thinking, insisting that the District's interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation `trumped' Mr. Kennedy's rights to religious exercise and free speech. 991 F.3d at 1017, see also id., at 1020-1021.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,87,"But how could that be? It is true that this Court and others often refer to the Establishment Clause, the Free Exercise Clause, and the Free Speech Clause as separate units. But the three Clauses appear in the same sentence of the same Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech. Amdt. 1. A natural reading of that sentence would seem to suggest the Clauses have complementary purposes, not warring ones where one Clause is always sure to prevail over the others. See Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 13, 15, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,88,"The District arrived at a different understanding this way. It began with the premise that the Establishment Clause is offended whenever a reasonable observer could conclude that the government has endorsed religion. App. 81. The District then took the view that a reasonable observer could think it endorsed Kennedy's religious activity by not stopping the practice. 991 F.3d at 1018, see also App. 80-81, Parts I and II, supra. On the District's account, it did not matter whether the Free Exercise Clause protected Mr. Kennedy's prayer. It did not matter if his expression was private speech protected by the Free Speech Clause. It did not matter that the District never actually endorsed Mr. Kennedy's prayer, no one complained that it had, and a strong public reaction only followed after the District sought to ban Mr. Kennedy's prayer.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,89,"Because a reasonable observer could (mistakenly) infer that by allowing the prayer the District endorsed Mr. Kennedy's message, the District felt it had to act, even if that meant suppressing otherwise protected First Amendment activities. In this way, the District effectively created its own vise between the Establishment Clause on one side and the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses on the other, placed itself in the middle, and then chose its preferred way out of its self-imposed trap. See Pinette, 515 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. 2440 (plurality opinion), Shurtleff v. Boston, 596 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct. 1583, 1605-1606, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,90,"To defend its approach, the District relied on Lemon and its progeny. See App. 43-45. In upholding the District's actions, the Ninth Circuit followed the same course. See Part II-C, supra. And, to be sure, in Lemon this Court attempted a grand unified theory for assessing Establishment Clause claims. American Legion v. American Humanist Assn., 588 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 2067, 2101, 204 L.Ed.2d 452 (2019) (plurality opinion). That approach called for an examination of a law's purposes, effects, and potential for entanglement with religion. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105. In time, the approach also came to involve estimations about whether a reasonable observer would consider the government's challenged action an endorsement of religion. See, e.g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 593, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989), id., at 630, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), Shurtleff, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1604-1605 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.)",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,91,"What the District and the Ninth Circuit overlooked, however, is that the shortcomings associated with this ambitious, abstract, and ahistorical approach to the Establishment Clause became so apparent that this Court long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot. American Legion, 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2079-2081 (plurality opinion), see also Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 575-577, 134 S.Ct. 1811, 188 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014). The Court has explained that these tests invited chaos in lower courts, led to differing results in materially identical cases, and created a minefield for legislators. Pinette, 515 U.S. at 768-769, n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 2440 (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted). This Court has since made plain, too, that the Establishment Clause does not include anything like a modified heckler's veto, in which  religious activity can be proscribed based on `perceptions' or `discomfort.' Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, 119, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001) (emphasis deleted). An Establishment Clause violation does not automatically follow whenever a public school or other government entity fails to censor private religious speech. Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (plurality opinion). Nor does the Clause compel the government to purge from the public sphere anything an objective observer could reasonably infer endorses or partakes of the religious. Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 699, 125 S.Ct. 2854, 162 L.Ed.2d 607 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). In fact, just this Term the Court unanimously rejected a city's attempt to censor religious speech based on Lemon and the endorsement test. See Shurtleff, 596 U. S., at ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1587-1588, id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1595 (ALITO, J., concurring  in judgment), id., at ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1587, 1588-1589 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.).4",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,92,"In place of Lemon and the endorsement test, this Court has instructed that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by `reference to historical practices and understandings.' Town of Greece, 572 U.S. at 576, 134 S.Ct. 1811, see also American Legion, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2087 (plurality opinion). `The line' that courts and governments must draw between the permissible and the impermissible has to `accord with history and faithfully reflect the understanding of the Founding Fathers.' Town of Greece, 572 U.S. at 577, 134 S.Ct. 1811 (quoting School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 294, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring)). An analysis focused on original meaning and history, this Court has stressed, has long represented the rule rather than some `exception' within the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. 572 U.S. at 575, 134 S.Ct. 1811, see American Legion, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2087 (plurality opinion), Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 490, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961) (analyzing certain historical elements of religious establishments), McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 437-440, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961) (analyzing Sunday closing laws by looking to their place  in the First Amendment's history), Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 680, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (analyzing the history and uninterrupted practice of church tax exemptions). The District and the Ninth Circuit erred by failing to heed this guidance.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,94,"Perhaps sensing that the primary theory it pursued below rests on a mistaken understanding of the Establishment Clause, the District offers a backup argument in this Court. It still contends that its Establishment Clause concerns trump Mr. Kennedy's free exercise and free speech rights. But the District now seeks to supply different reasoning for that result. Now, it says, it was justified in suppressing Mr. Kennedy's religious activity because  otherwise it would have been guilty of coercing students to pray. See Brief for Respondent 34-37. And, the District says, coercing worship amounts to an Establishment Clause violation on anyone's account of the Clause's original meaning.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,95,"As it turns out, however, there is a pretty obvious reason why the Ninth Circuit did not adopt this theory in proceedings below: The evidence cannot sustain it. To be sure, this Court has long held that government may not, consistent with a historically sensitive understanding of the Establishment Clause, make a religious observance compulsory. Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314, 72 S.Ct. 679, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952). Government may not coerce anyone to attend church, ibid., nor may it force citizens to engage in a formal religious exercise, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 589, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992). No doubt, too, coercion along these lines was among the foremost hallmarks of religious establishments the framers sought to prohibit when they adopted the First Amendment.5 Members of this Court have sometimes disagreed on what exactly qualifies as impermissible coercion in light of the original meaning of the Establishment Clause. Compare Lee, 505 U.S. at 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649, with id., at 640-641, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Scalia, J., dissenting). But in this case Mr. Kennedy's private religious exercise did not come close to crossing any line one might imagine separating protected private expression from impermissible government coercion.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,96,"Begin with the District's own contemporaneous description of the facts. In its correspondence with Mr. Kennedy, the District never raised coercion concerns. To the contrary, the District conceded in a public 2015 document that there was no evidence that students were directly coerced to pray with Kennedy. App. 105. This is consistent with Mr. Kennedy's account too. He has repeatedly stated that he never coerced, required, or asked any student to pray, and that he never told any student that it was important that they participate in any religious activity. Id., at 170.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,97,"Consider, too, the actual requests Mr. Kennedy made. The District did not discipline Mr. Kennedy for engaging in prayer while presenting locker-room speeches to students. That tradition predated Mr. Kennedy at the school. App. 170. And he willingly ended it, as the District has acknowledged. Id., at 77, 170. He also willingly ended his practice of postgame religious talks with his team. Id., at 70, 77, 170-172. The only prayer Mr. Kennedy sought to continue was the kind he had started out doing at the beginning of his tenure—the prayer he gave alone. Id., at 293-294. He made clear that he could pray while the kids were doing the fight song and take a knee by himself and give thanks and continue on. Id., at 294. Mr. Kennedy even considered it acceptable to say his prayer while the players were walking to the locker room or bus, and then catch up with his team. Id., at 280, 282, see also id., at 59 (proposing the team leave the field for the prayer). In short, Mr. Kennedy did not seek to direct any prayers to students or require anyone else to participate.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,98,"His plan was to wait to pray until athletes were occupied, and he told everybody that's what he wished to do. Id., at 292. It was for three prayers of this sort alone in October 2015 that the District suspended him. See Parts I-B and I-C, supra.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,99,"Naturally, Mr. Kennedy's proposal to pray quietly by himself on the field would have meant some people would have seen his religious exercise. Those close at hand might have heard him too. But learning how to tolerate speech or prayer of all kinds is part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society, a trait of character essential to a tolerant citizenry. Lee, 505 U.S. at 590, 112 S.Ct. 2649. This Court has long recognized as well that secondary school students are mature enough  to understand that a school does not endorse, let alone coerce them to participate in, speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis. Mergens, 496 U.S. at 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality opinion). Of course, some will take offense to certain forms of speech or prayer they are sure to encounter in a society where those activities enjoy such robust constitutional protection. But offense  does not equate to coercion. Town of Greece, 572 U.S. at 589, 134 S.Ct. 1811 (plurality opinion).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,100,"The District responds that, as a coach, Mr. Kennedy wielded enormous authority and influence over the students, and students might have felt compelled to pray alongside him. Brief for Respondent 37. To support this argument, the District submits that, after Mr. Kennedy's suspension, a few parents told District employees that their sons had participated in the team prayers only because they did not wish to separate themselves from the team.

2021-061,101,"This reply fails too. Not only does the District rely on hearsay to advance it. For all we can tell, the concerns the District says it heard from parents were occasioned by the locker-room prayers that predated Mr. Kennedy's tenure or his postgame religious talks, all of which he discontinued at the District's request. There is no indication in the record that anyone expressed any coercion concerns to the District about the quiet, postgame prayers that Mr. Kennedy asked to continue and that led to his suspension. Nor is there any record evidence that students felt pressured to participate in these prayers. To the contrary, and as we have seen, not a single Bremerton student joined Mr. Kennedy's quiet prayers following the three October 2015 games for which he was disciplined. On October 16, those students who joined Mr. Kennedy were `from the opposing team,' 991 F.3d at 1012-1013, and thus could not have reasonably feared that he would decrease their playing time or destroy their opportunities if they did not participate, Brief for Respondent 43. As for the other two relevant games, no one joined Mr. Kennedy on October 23. 991 F.3d at 1019. And only a few members of the public participated on October 26. App. 97, 314-315, see also Part I-B, supra.6",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,102,"The absence of evidence of coercion in this record leaves the District to its  final redoubt. Here, the District suggests that any visible religious conduct by a teacher or coach should be deemed—without more and as a matter of law—impermissibly coercive on students. In essence, the District asks us to adopt the view that the only acceptable government role models for students are those who eschew any visible religious expression. See also post, at 2442-2443 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). If the argument sounds familiar, it should. Really, it is just another way of repackaging the District's earlier submission that government may script everything a teacher or coach says in the workplace. See Part III-B, supra. The only added twist here is the District's suggestion not only that it may prohibit teachers from engaging in any demonstrative religious activity, but that it must do so in order to conform to the Constitution.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,103,"Such a rule would be a sure sign that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence had gone off the rails. In the name of protecting religious liberty, the District would have us suppress it. Rather than respect the First Amendment's double protection for religious expression, it would have us preference secular activity. Not only could schools fire teachers for praying quietly over their lunch, for wearing a yarmulke to school, or for offering a midday prayer during a break before practice. Under the District's rule, a school would be required to do so. It is a rule that would defy this Court's traditional understanding that permitting private speech is not the same thing as coercing others to participate in it. See Town of Greece, 572 U.S. at 589, 134 S.Ct. 1811 (plurality opinion). It is a rule, too, that would undermine a long constitutional tradition under which learning how to tolerate diverse expressive activities has always been part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society. Lee, 505 U.S. at 590, 112 S.Ct. 2649. We are aware of no historically sound understanding of the Establishment Clause that begins to make it necessary for government to be hostile to religion in this way. Zorach, 343 U.S. at 314, 72 S.Ct. 679.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,104,"Our judgments on all these scores find support in this Court's prior cases too. In Zorach, for example, challengers argued that a public school program permitting students to spend time in private religious instruction off campus was impermissibly coercive. Id., at 308, 311-312, 72 S.Ct. 679. The Court rejected that challenge because students were not required to attend religious instruction and there was no evidence that any employee had used their office to persuade or force students to participate in religious activity. Id., at 311, and n. 6, 72 S.Ct. 679. What was clear there is even more obvious here—where there is no evidence anyone sought to persuade or force students to participate, and there is no formal school program accommodating the religious activity at issue.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,105,"Meanwhile, this case looks very different from those in which this Court has found prayer involving public school students to be problematically coercive. In Lee, this Court held that school officials violated the Establishment Clause by including a clerical member who publicly recited prayers as part of an official school graduation ceremony because the school had in every practical sense compelled attendance and participation in a religious exercise. 505 U.S. at 580, 598, 112 S.Ct. 2649. In Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, the Court held that a school district violated the Establishment Clause by broadcasting a prayer over the public address system before each football game. 530 U.S. 290, 294, 120 S.Ct. 2266, 147 L.Ed.2d 295 (2000). The Court observed that, while students generally were not required to attend games, attendance was required for cheerleaders, members of the band, and, of course, the team  members themselves. Id., at 311, 120 S.Ct. 2266. None of that is true here. The prayers for which Mr. Kennedy was disciplined were not publicly broadcast or recited to a captive audience. Students were not required or expected to participate. And, in fact, none of Mr. Kennedy's students did participate in any of the three October 2015 prayers that resulted in Mr. Kennedy's discipline. See App. 90, 97, 173, 236-239, Parts I-B and I-C, supra.7",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,107,"In the end, the District's case hinges on the need to generate conflict between an individual's rights under the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses and its own Establishment Clause duties— and then develop some explanation why one of these Clauses in the First Amendment should `trump' the other two. 991 F.3d at 1017, App. 43. But the project falters badly. Not only does the District fail to offer a sound reason to prefer one constitutional guarantee over another. It cannot even show that they are at odds. In truth, there is no conflict between the constitutional commands before us. There is only the mere shadow of a conflict, a false choice premised on a misconstruction of the Establishment Clause. Schempp, 374 U.S. at 308, 83 S.Ct. 1560 (Goldberg, J., concurring). And in no world may a government entity's concerns about phantom constitutional violations justify actual violations of an individual's First Amendment rights. See, e.g., Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 845-846, 115 S.Ct. 2510, Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 112-119, 121 S.Ct. 2093, Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 394-395, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), Widmar, 454 U.S. at 270-275, 102 S.Ct. 269.8",Gorsuch,0,
2021-061,109,"Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse  Republic—whether those expressions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether they manifest through the spoken word or a bowed head. Here, a government entity sought to punish an individual for engaging in a brief, quiet, personal religious observance doubly protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. And the only meaningful justification the government offered for its reprisal rested on a mistaken view that it had a duty to ferret out and suppress religious observances even as it allows comparable secular speech. The Constitution neither mandates nor tolerates that kind of discrimination. Mr. Kennedy is entitled to summary judgment on his First Amendment claims.

2021-061,112,I join the Court's opinion because it correctly holds that Bremerton School District violated Joseph Kennedy's First Amendment rights. I write separately to emphasize that the Court's opinion does not resolve two issues related to Kennedy's free-exercise claim.,Thomas,0,
2021-061,113,"First, the Court refrains from deciding whether or how public employees' rights under the Free Exercise Clause may or may not be different from those enjoyed by the general public. See ante, at 2425, n. 2. In striking the appropriate balance between public employees' constitutional rights and the realities of the employment context, we have often considered whether the asserted employee right implicates the basic concerns of the relevant constitutional provision, or whether the claimed right can more readily give way to the requirements of the government as employer. Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U.S. 591, 600, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008). In the free-speech context, for example, that inquiry has prompted us to distinguish between different kinds of speech, we have held that the First Amendment protects public employee speech only when it falls within the core of First Amendment protection— speech on matters of public concern. Ibid. It remains an open question, however, if a similar analysis can or should apply to free-exercise claims in light of the history and tradition of the Free Exercise Clause. Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 406, 131 S.Ct. 2488, 180 L.Ed.2d 408 (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), see also id., at 400, 131 S.Ct. 2488 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).",Thomas,0,
2021-061,114,"Second, the Court also does not decide what burden a government employer must shoulder to justify restricting an employee's religious expression because the District had no constitutional basis for reprimanding Kennedy under any possibly applicable standard of scrutiny. See ante, at 2426. While we have many public-employee precedents addressing how the interest-balancing test set out in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), applies under the Free Speech Clause, the Court has never before applied Pickering balancing to a claim brought under the Free Exercise Clause. A government employer's burden therefore might differ depending on which First Amendment guarantee a public employee invokes.",Thomas,0,
2021-061,115,"Justice ALITO, concurring.",Alito,0,
2021-061,116,"The expression at issue in this case is unlike that in any of our prior cases involving the free-speech rights of public employees. Petitioner's expression occurred while at work but during a time when a brief lull in his duties apparently gave him a few free moments to engage in private  activities. When he engaged in this expression, he acted in a purely private capacity. The Court does not decide what standard applies to such expression under the Free Speech Clause but holds only that retaliation for this expression cannot be justified based on any of the standards discussed. On that understanding, I join the opinion in full.",Alito,0,
2021-061,117,"Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice BREYER and Justice KAGAN join, dissenting.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,118,"This case is about whether a public school must permit a school official to kneel, bow his head, and say a prayer at the center of a school event. The Constitution does not authorize, let alone require, public schools to embrace this conduct. Since Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962), this Court consistently has recognized that school officials leading prayer is constitutionally impermissible. Official-led prayer strikes at the core of our constitutional protections for the religious liberty of students and their parents, as embodied in both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,119,"The Court now charts a different path, yet again paying almost exclusive attention to the Free Exercise Clause's protection for individual religious exercise while giving short shrift to the Establishment Clause's prohibition on state establishment of religion. See Carson v. Makin, 596 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, (2022) (BREYER, J., dissenting). To the degree the Court portrays petitioner Joseph Kennedy's prayers as private and quiet, it misconstrues the facts. The record reveals that Kennedy had a longstanding practice of conducting demonstrative prayers on the 50-yard line of the football field. Kennedy consistently invited others to join his prayers and for years led student athletes in prayer at the same time and location. The Court ignores this history. The Court also ignores the severe disruption to school events caused by Kennedy's conduct, viewing it as irrelevant because the Bremerton School District (District) stated that it was suspending Kennedy to avoid it being viewed as endorsing religion. Under the Court's analysis, presumably this would be a different case if the District had cited Kennedy's repeated disruptions of school programming and violations of school policy regarding public access to the field as grounds for suspending him. As the District did not articulate those grounds, the Court assesses only the District's Establishment Clause concerns. It errs by assessing them divorced from the context and history of Kennedy's prayer practice.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,120,"Today's decision goes beyond merely misreading the record. The Court overrules Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), and calls into question decades of subsequent precedents that it deems offshoots of that decision. Ante, at 2427. In the process, the Court rejects longstanding concerns surrounding government endorsement of religion and replaces the standard for reviewing such questions with a new history and tradition test. In addition, while the Court reaffirms that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from coercing participation in religious exercise, it applies a nearly toothless version of the coercion analysis, failing to acknowledge the unique pressures faced by students when participating in school-sponsored activities. This decision does a disservice to schools and the young citizens they serve, as well as to our Nation's longstanding commitment to the separation of church and state. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,122,"As the majority tells it, Kennedy, a coach for the District's football program, lost his job for praying quietly while his students were otherwise occupied. Ante, at 2415. The record before us, however, tells a different story.",Sotomayor,0,

Id., at 56. In addition, Kennedy's position made him responsible for interacting with members of the community. In this capacity, the District required Kennedy and other coaches to maintain positive media relations, always approach officials with composure with the expectation that they were constantly being observed by others, and communicate effectively with parents. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,127,"Finally, District coaches had to adhere to District policies and administrative regulations more generally. Id., at 30-31. As relevant here, the District's policy on Religious-Related Activities and Practices provided that school staff shall neither encourage or discourage a student from engaging in non-disruptive oral or silent prayer or any other form of devotional activity and that religious services, programs or assemblies shall not be conducted in school facilities during school hours or in connection with any school sponsored or school related activity.

It learned that, since his hiring in 2008, Kennedy had been kneeling on the 50-yard line to pray immediately after shaking hands with the opposing team. Kennedy recounted that he initially prayed alone and that he never asked any student to join him. Over time, however, a majority of  the team came to join him, with the numbers varying from game to game. Kennedy's practice evolved into postgame talks in which Kennedy would hold aloft student helmets and deliver speeches with overtly religious references, which Kennedy described as prayers, while the players kneeled around him. Id., at 40. The District also learned that students had prayed in the past in the locker room prior to games, before Kennedy was hired, but that Kennedy subsequently began leading those prayers too.",Sotomayor,0,

The District acknowledged that Kennedy had not actively encouraged, or required, participation but emphasized that school staff may not indirectly encourage students to engage in religious activity or endorse religious activity, rather, the District explained, staff must remain neutral while performing their job duties.

Id., at 40-41.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,135,"Kennedy stopped participating in locker room prayers and, after a game the following day, gave a secular speech. He returned to pray in the stadium alone after his duties were over and everyone had left the stadium, to which the District had no objection. Kennedy then hired an attorney, who, on October 14, sent a letter explaining that Kennedy was motivated by his sincerely-held religious beliefs to pray following each football game. Id., at 63. The letter claimed that the District had required that Kennedy flee from students if they voluntarily choose to come to a place where he is privately praying during personal time, referring to the 50-yard line of the football field immediately following the conclusion of a game.

For instance, Kennedy's letter asserted that he had not invited anyone to pray with him, the District noted that that might be true of Kennedy's September 17 prayer specifically, but that Kennedy had acknowledged inviting others to join him on many previous occasions. The District's September 17 letter had explained that Kennedy traditionally held up helmets from the BHS and opposing teams while players from each team kneeled around him. While Kennedy's letter asserted that his prayers occurred `on his own time,' after his duties as a District employee had ceased, the District pointed out that Kennedy remained on duty when his prayers occurred immediately following completion of the football game, when students are still on the football field, in uniform, under the stadium lights, with the audience still in attendance, and while Mr. Kennedy is still in his District-issued and District-logoed attire. Id., at 78 (emphasis deleted).

Id., at 79.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,138,"The District stated that it had no objection to Kennedy returning to the stadium when he was off duty to pray at the 50-yard line, nor with Kennedy praying while on duty if it did not interfere with his job duties or suggest the District's endorsement of religion. The District explained that its establishment concerns were motivated by the specific facts at issue, because engaging in prayer on the 50-yard line immediately after the game finished would appear to be an extension of Kennedy's prior, long-standing and well-known history of leading students in prayer on the 50-yard line after games.

Id., at 92-93.

Kennedy moved for a preliminary injunction, which the District Court denied based on the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's prayers. The court concluded that Kennedy had chosen a time and event, the October 16 homecoming game, that was a big deal for students, and then used that opportunity to convey his religious views in a manner a reasonable observer would have seen as a public employee  leading an orchestrated session of faith. App. to Pet. for Cert. 303. The Court of Appeals affirmed, again emphasizing the specific context of Kennedy's prayers. The court rejected Kennedy's contention that he had been praying on the fifty-yard line `silently and alone.' Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist., 869 F.3d 813, 825 (C.A.9 2017). The court noted that he had in fact refused an accommodation permitting him to pray  after the stadium had emptied, indicating that it is essential that his speech be delivered in the presence of students and spectators. Ibid. This Court denied certiorari.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,150,"Following discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment to the District. The court concluded that Kennedy's 50-yard-line prayers were not entitled to protection under the Free Speech Clause because his speech was made in his capacity as a public employee, not as a private citizen. 443 F.Supp.3d 1223, 1237 (W.D. Wash. 2020). In addition, the court held that Kennedy's prayer practice violated the Establishment Clause, reasoning that speech from the center of the football field immediately after each game  conveys official sanction. Id., at 1238. That was especially true where Kennedy, a school employee, initiated the prayer, Kennedy was joined by students or adults to create a group of worshippers in a place the school controls access to, and Kennedy had a long history of engaging in religious activity with players that would have led a familiar observer to believe that Kennedy was continuing this tradition with prayer at the 50-yard line. Id., at 1238-1239. The District Court further found that players had reported feeling compelled to join Kennedy in prayer to stay connected with the team or ensure playing time, and that the slow accumulation of players joining Kennedy suggests  exactly the type of vulnerability to social pressure that makes the Establishment Clause vital in the high school context. Id., at 1239. The court rejected Kennedy's free exercise claim, finding the District's directive narrowly tailored to its Establishment Clause concerns and citing Kennedy's refusal to cooperate in finding an accommodation that would be acceptable to him. Id., at 1240.",Sotomayor,0,

In the alternative, the court concluded that Kennedy's speech, even if in his capacity as a private citizen, was appropriately regulated by the District to avoid an Establishment Clause violation, emphasizing once more that this conclusion was tied to the specific evolution of Kennedy's prayer practice with students over time. Id., at 1018. The court rejected Kennedy's free exercise claim for the reasons stated by the District Court. Id., at 1020. The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc, and this Court granted certiorari.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,153,"Properly understood, this case is not about the limits on an individual's ability to engage in private prayer at work. This case is about whether a school district is required to allow one of its employees to incorporate a public, communicative display of the employee's personal religious beliefs into a school event, where that display is recognizable as part of a longstanding practice of the employee ministering religion to students as the public watched. A school district is not required to permit such conduct, in fact, the Establishment Clause prohibits it from doing so.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,155,"The Establishment Clause prohibits States from adopting laws respecting an establishment of religion. Amdt. 1, see Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 49, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (recognizing the Clause's incorporation against the States). The First Amendment's next Clause prohibits the government from making any law prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Taken together, these two Clauses (the Religion Clauses) express the view, foundational to our constitutional system, that religious beliefs and religious expression are too precious to be either proscribed or prescribed by the State. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 589, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992). Instead, preservation and transmission of religious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choice committed to the private sphere, which has the freedom to pursue that mission. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,156,"The Establishment Clause protects this freedom by commanding a separation of church and state. Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005). At its core, this means forbidding sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 668, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970).

2021-061,158,"Indeed, the Court has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583-584, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987). The reasons motivating this vigilance inhere in the nature of schools themselves and the young people they serve. Two are relevant here.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,159,"First, government neutrality toward religion is particularly important in the public school context given the role public schools play in our society. `The public school is at once the symbol of our democracy and the most pervasive means for promoting our common destiny,' meaning that `in no activity of the State is it more vital to keep out divisive forces than in its schools.' Id. at 584, 107 S.Ct. 2573. Families entrust public schools with the education of their children  on the understanding that the classroom will not purposely be used to advance religious views that may conflict with the private beliefs of the student and his or her family. Ibid. Accordingly, the Establishment Clause proscribes public schools from `conveying or attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred' or otherwise endorsing religious beliefs. Lee, 505 U.S. at 604-605, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (emphasis deleted).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,160,"Second, schools face a higher risk of unconstitutionally coercing  support or participation in religion or its exercise than other government entities. Id., at 587, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (opinion of the Court). The State exerts great authority and coercive power in schools as a general matter through mandatory attendance requirements. Edwards, 482 U.S. at 584, 107 S.Ct. 2573. Moreover, the State exercises that great authority over children, who are uniquely susceptible to subtle coercive pressure. Lee, 505 U.S. at 588, 112 S.Ct. 2649, cf. Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 590, 134 S.Ct. 1811, 188 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014) (plurality opinion) (Mature adults, unlike children, may not be `readily susceptible to religious indoctrination or peer pressure'). Children are particularly vulnerable to coercion because of their emulation of teachers as role models and susceptibility to peer pressure. Edwards, 482 U.S. at 584, 107 S.Ct. 2573. Accordingly, this Court has emphasized that the State may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, place primary and secondary school children in the dilemma of choosing between participating, with all that implies, or protesting a religious exercise in a public school. Lee, 505 U.S. at 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,161,"Given the twin Establishment Clause concerns of endorsement and coercion, it is unsurprising that the Court has consistently held integrating prayer into public school activities to be unconstitutional, including when student participation is not a formal requirement or prayer is silent. See Wallace, 472 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 2479 (mandatory moment of silence for prayer), School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (nonmandatory recitation of Bible verses and prayer), Engel, 370 U.S. at 424, 82 S.Ct. 1261 (nonmandatory recitation of one-sentence prayer). The Court also has held that incorporating a nondenominational general benediction into a graduation ceremony is unconstitutional. Lee, 505 U.S. 577, 112 S.Ct. 2649. Finally, this Court has held that including prayers in student football games is unconstitutional, even when delivered by students rather than staff and even when students themselves initiated the prayer. Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe,  530 U.S. 290, 120 S.Ct. 2266, 147 L.Ed.2d 295 (2000).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,163,"Under these precedents, the Establishment Clause violation at hand is clear. This Court has held that a state official directing the performance of a formal religious exercise as a part of the ceremony of a school event conflicts with settled rules pertaining to prayer exercises for students. Lee, 505 U.S. at 586-587, 112 S.Ct. 2649. Kennedy was on the job as a school official on government property when he incorporated a public, demonstrative prayer into government-sponsored school-related events as a regularly scheduled feature of those events. Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 302, 120 S.Ct. 2266.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,164,"Kennedy's tradition of a 50-yard line prayer thus strikes at the heart of the Establishment Clause's concerns about endorsement. For students and community members at the game, Coach Kennedy was the face and the voice of the District during football games. The timing and location Kennedy selected for his prayers were clothed in the traditional indicia of school sporting events. Id., at 308, 120 S.Ct. 2266. Kennedy spoke from the playing field, which was accessible only to students and school employees, not to the general public. Although the football game itself had ended, the football game events had not, Kennedy himself acknowledged that his responsibilities continued until the players went home. Kennedy's postgame responsibilities were what placed Kennedy on the 50-yard line in the first place, that was, after all, where he met the opposing team to shake hands after the game. Permitting a school coach to lead students and others he invited onto the field in prayer at a predictable time after each game could only be viewed as a postgame tradition occurring with the approval of the school administration. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,165,"Kennedy's prayer practice also implicated the coercion concerns at the center of this Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. This Court has previously recognized a heightened potential for coercion where school officials are involved, as their efforts to monitor prayer will be perceived by the students as inducing a participation they might otherwise reject. Lee, 505 U.S. at 590, 112 S.Ct. 2649. The reasons for fearing this pressure are self-evident. This Court has recognized that students face immense social pressure. Students look up to their teachers and coaches as role models and seek their approval. Students also depend on this approval for tangible benefits. Players recognize that gaining the coach's approval may pay dividends small and large, from extra playing time to a stronger letter of recommendation to additional support in college athletic recruiting. In addition to these pressures to please their coaches, this Court has recognized that players face immense social pressure from their peers in the extracurricular event that is American high school football. Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 311, 120 S.Ct. 2266.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,166,"The record before the Court bears this out. The District Court found, in the evidentiary record, that some students reported joining Kennedy's prayer because they felt social pressure to follow their coach and teammates. Kennedy told the District that he began his prayers alone and that players followed each other over time until a majority of the team joined him, an evolution showing coercive pressure at work.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,167,"Kennedy does not defend his longstanding practice of leading the team in prayer out loud on the field as they kneeled around him. Instead, he responds, and the Court accepts, that his highly visible and  demonstrative prayer at the last three games before his suspension did not violate the Establishment Clause because these prayers were quiet and thus private. This Court's precedents, however, do not permit isolating government actions from their context in determining whether they violate the Establishment Clause. To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly stated that Establishment Clause inquiries are fact specific and require careful consideration of the origins and practical reality of the specific practice at issue. See, e.g., id., at 315, 120 S.Ct. 2266, Lee, 505 U.S. at 597, 112 S.Ct. 2649. In Santa Fe, the Court specifically addressed how to determine whether the implementation of a new policy regarding prayers at football games insulates the continuation of such prayers from constitutional scrutiny. 530 U.S. at 315, 120 S.Ct. 2266. The Court held that inquiry into this question not only can, but must, include an examination of the circumstances surrounding the change in policy, the long-established tradition before the change, and the `unique circumstances' of the school in question. Ibid. This Court's precedent thus does not permit treating Kennedy's new prayer practice as occurring on a blank slate, any more than those in the District's school community would have experienced Kennedy's changed practice (to the degree there was one) as erasing years of prior actions by Kennedy.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,168,"Like the policy change in Santa Fe, Kennedy's changed prayers at these last three games were a clear continuation of a long-established tradition of sanctioning school official involvement in student prayers. Ibid. Students at the three games following Kennedy's changed practice witnessed Kennedy kneeling at the same time and place where he had led them in prayer for years. They witnessed their peers from opposing teams joining Kennedy, just as they had when Kennedy was leading joint team prayers. They witnessed members of the public and state representatives going onto the field to support Kennedy's cause and pray with him. Kennedy did nothing to stop this unauthorized access to the field, a clear dereliction of his duties. The BHS players in fact joined the crowd around Kennedy after he stood up from praying at the last game. That BHS students did not join Kennedy in these last three specific prayers did not make those events compliant with the Establishment Clause. The coercion to do so was evident. Kennedy himself apparently anticipated that his continued prayer practice would draw student participation, requesting that the District agree that it would not interfere with students joining him in the future. App. 71.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,169,"Finally, Kennedy stresses that he never formally required students to join him in his prayers. But existing precedents do not require coercion to be explicit, particularly when children are involved. To the contrary, this Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence establishes that `the government may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use more direct means.' Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 312, 120 S.Ct. 2266. Thus, the Court has held that the Establishment Clause will not permit a school `to exact religious conformity from a student as the price' of joining her classmates at a varsity football game. Ibid. To uphold a coach's integration of prayer into the ceremony of a football game, in the context of an established history of the coach inviting student involvement in prayer, is to exact precisely this price from students.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,171,"As the Court explains, see ante, at 2423, Kennedy did not shed his constitutional rights  at the schoolhouse gate while on duty as a coach. Tinker v. Des Moines  Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). Constitutional rights, however, are not absolutes. Rights often conflict and balancing of interests is often required to protect the separate rights at issue. See Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 597 U. S. ___, ___, 142 S.Ct. 2228, 2322-2323, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, (2022) (BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting) (noting that the presence of countervailing interests  is what makes a constitutional question hard, and what requires balancing).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,172,"The particular tensions at issue in this case, between the speech interests of the government and its employees and between public institutions' religious neutrality and private individuals' religious exercise, are far from novel. This Court's settled precedents offer guidance to assist courts, governments, and the public in navigating these tensions. Under these precedents, the District's interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation justified both its time and place restrictions on Kennedy's speech and his exercise of religion.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,173,"First, as to Kennedy's free speech claim, Kennedy accepted certain limitations on his freedom of speech when he accepted government employment. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). The Court has recognized that government employers, like private employers, need a significant degree of control over their employees' words and actions to ensure the efficient provision of public services. Ibid. Case law instructs balancing the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees to determine whose interests should prevail. Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,174,"As the Court of Appeals below outlined, the District has a strong argument that Kennedy's speech, formally integrated into the center of a District event, was speech in his official capacity as an employee that is not entitled to First Amendment protections at all. See Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 991 F.3d at 1014-1016 (applying Garcetti).3 It is unnecessary to resolve this question, however, because, even assuming that Kennedy's speech was in his capacity as a private citizen, the District's responsibilities under the Establishment Clause provided adequate justification for restricting it. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,175,"Similarly, Kennedy's free exercise claim must be considered in light of the fact that he is a school official and, as such, his  participation in religious exercise can create Establishment Clause conflicts. Accordingly, his right to pray at any time and in any manner he wishes while exercising his professional duties is not absolute. See Lee, 505 U.S. at 587, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (noting that a school official's choice to integrate a prayer is attributable to the State). As the Court explains, see ante, at 2422-2423, the parties agree (and I therefore assume) that for the purposes of Kennedy's claim, the burden is on the District to establish that its policy prohibiting Kennedy's public prayers was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling state interest. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,176,"Here, the District's directive prohibiting Kennedy's demonstrative speech at the 50-yard line was narrowly tailored to avoid an Establishment Clause violation. The District's suspension of Kennedy followed a long history. The last three games proved that Kennedy did not intend to pray silently, but to thrust the District into incorporating a religious ceremony into its events, as he invited others to join his prayer and anticipated in his communications with the District that students would want to join as well. Notably, the District repeatedly sought to work with Kennedy to develop an accommodation to permit him to engage in religious exercise during or after his game-related responsibilities. Kennedy, however, ultimately refused to respond to the District's suggestions and declined to communicate with the District, except through media appearances. Because the District's valid Establishment Clause concerns satisfy strict scrutiny, Kennedy's free exercise claim fails as well.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,178,"Despite the overwhelming precedents establishing that school officials leading prayer violates the Establishment Clause, the Court today holds that Kennedy's midfield prayer practice did not violate the Establishment Clause. This decision rests on an erroneous understanding of the Religion Clauses. It also disregards the balance this Court's cases strike among the rights conferred by the Clauses. The Court relies on an assortment of pluralities, concurrences, and dissents by Members of the current majority to effect fundamental changes in this Court's Religion Clauses jurisprudence, all the while proclaiming that nothing has changed at all.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,180,"This case involves three Clauses of the First Amendment. As a threshold matter, the Court today proceeds from two mistaken understandings of the way the protections these Clauses embody interact.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,181,"First, the Court describes the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses as working in tandem to provide overlapping protection for expressive religious activities, leaving religious speech doubly protected. Ante, at 2421. This narrative noticeably (and improperly) sets the Establishment Clause to the side. The Court is correct that certain expressive religious activities may fall within the ambit of both the Free Speech Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, but the First Amendment protects speech and religion by quite different mechanisms. Lee, 505 U.S. at 591, 112 S.Ct. 2649. The First Amendment protects speech by ensuring its full expression even when the government participates. Ibid. Its method for protecting freedom of worship and freedom of conscience in religious matters is quite the reverse, however, based on the understanding that the government is not a prime participant in religious debate or expression, whereas government is the object of some of our most important  speech. Ibid. Thus, as this Court has explained, while the Free Speech Clause has close parallels in the speech provisions of the First Amendment, the First Amendment's protections for religion diverge from those for speech because of the Establishment Clause, which provides a specific prohibition on forms of state intervention in religious affairs with no precise counterpart in the speech provisions. Ibid. Therefore, while our Constitution counsels mutual respect and tolerance, the Constitution's vision of how to achieve this end does in fact involve some singling out of religious speech by the government. Ante, at 2415-2416. This is consistent with the lesson of history that was and is the inspiration for the Establishment Clause, the lesson that in the hands of government what might begin as a tolerant expression of religious views may end in a policy to indoctrinate and coerce. Lee, 505 U.S. at 591-592, 112 S.Ct. 2649.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,182,"Second, the Court contends that the lower courts erred by introducing a false tension between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses. See ante, at 2426-2427. The Court, however, has long recognized that these two Clauses, while expressing complementary values, often exert conflicting pressures. Cutter, 544 U.S. at 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113. See also Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 718, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004) (describing the Clauses as frequently in tension). The absolute terms of the two Clauses mean that they tend to clash if expanded to a logical extreme. Walz, 397 U.S. at 668-669, 90 S.Ct. 1409.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,183,"The Court inaccurately implies that the courts below relied upon a rule that the Establishment Clause must always prevail over the Free Exercise Clause. Ante, at 2426. In focusing almost exclusively on Kennedy's free exercise claim, however, and declining to recognize the conflicting rights at issue, the Court substitutes one supposed blanket rule for another. The proper response where tension arises between the two Clauses is not to ignore it, which effectively silently elevates one party's right above others. The proper response is to identify the tension and balance the interests based on a careful analysis of whether the particular acts in question are intended to establish or interfere with religious beliefs and practices or have the effect of doing so. Walz, 397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409. As discussed above, that inquiry leads to the conclusion that permitting Kennedy's desired religious practice at the time and place of his choosing, without regard to the legitimate needs of his employer, violates the Establishment Clause in the particular context at issue here. Supra, at 2442-2445.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,185,"For decades, the Court has recognized that, in determining whether a school has violated the Establishment Clause, one of the relevant questions is whether an objective observer, acquainted with the text, legislative history, and implementation of the practice, would perceive it as a state endorsement of prayer in public schools. Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 308, 120 S.Ct. 2266 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court now says for the first time that endorsement simply does not matter, and completely repudiates the test established in Lemon, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105. Ante, at 2427-2429. Both of these moves are erroneous and, despite the Court's assurances, novel.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,186,"Start with endorsement. The Court reserves particular criticism for the longstanding understanding that government action that appears to endorse religion violates the Establishment Clause, which it describes as an offshoot of Lemon and  paints as a `modified heckler's veto, in which  religious activity can be proscribed' based on `perceptions' or `discomfort.' Ante, at 2426-2427 (quoting Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, 119, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001)). This is a strawman. Precedent long has recognized that endorsement concerns under the Establishment Clause, properly understood, bear no relation to a `heckler's veto.' Ante, at 2427. Good News Club itself explained the difference between the two: The endorsement inquiry considers the perspective not of just any hypothetical or uninformed observer experiencing subjective discomfort, but of `the reasonable observer' who is `aware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious speech takes place.' 533 U.S. at 119, 121 S.Ct. 2093. That is because `the endorsement inquiry is not about the perceptions of particular individuals or saving isolated nonadherents from discomfort' but concern `with the political community writ large.' Ibid. (emphasis deleted).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,187,"Given this concern for the political community, it is unsurprising that the Court has long prioritized endorsement concerns in the context of public education. See, e.g., Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 305, 120 S.Ct. 2266, Wallace, 472 U.S. at 60-61, 105 S.Ct. 2479, Edwards, 482 U.S. at 578, 593, 107 S.Ct. 2573, see also Lee, 505 U.S. at 618-619, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Souter, J., concurring) (explaining that many of the Court's Establishment Clause holdings in the school context are concerned not with whether the policy in question coerced students to participate in prayer but with whether it `conveyed a message of state approval of prayer activities in the public schools' (quoting Wallace, 472 U.S. at 61, 105 S.Ct. 2479)).4 No subsequent decisions in other contexts, including the cases about monuments and legislative meetings on which the Court relies, have so much as questioned the application of this core Establishment Clause concern in the context of public schools. In fact, Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565, 134 S.Ct. 1811, 188 L.Ed.2d 835, which held a prayer during a town meeting permissible, specifically distinguished Lee because Lee considered the Establishment Clause in the context of schools. 572 U.S. at 590, 134 S.Ct. 1811 (plurality opinion).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,188,"Paying heed to these precedents would not `purge from the public sphere' anything an observer could reasonably infer endorses religion. Ante, at 2427. To the contrary, the Court has recognized that there will be instances when religious values, religious practices, and religious persons will have some interaction with the public schools and their students. Lee, 505 U.S. at 598-599, 112 S.Ct. 2649. These instances, the Court has said, are often questions of accommodating religious practices to the degree possible while respecting the Establishment Clause. Id., at 599, 112 S.Ct. 2649.5 In short, the endorsement  inquiry dictated by precedent is a measured, practical, and administrable one, designed to account for the competing interests present within any given community.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,189,"Despite all of this authority, the Court claims that it long ago abandoned both the endorsement test and this Court's decision in Lemon, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105. Ante, at 2427. The Court chiefly cites the plurality opinion in American Legion v. American Humanist Assn., 588 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 2067, 204 L.Ed.2d 452 (2019) to support this contention. That plurality opinion, to be sure, criticized Lemon's effort at establishing a grand unified theory of the Establishment Clause as poorly suited to the broad array of diverse establishment claims. 588 U. S., at ___, ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2080, 2087. All the Court in American Legion ultimately held, however, was that application of the Lemon test to longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices was ill-advised for reasons specific to those contexts. 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2082, see also id., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2081-2085 (discussing at some length why the Lemon test was a poor fit for those circumstances). The only categorical rejection of Lemon in American Legion appeared in separate writings. See 588 U. S., at ___ 139 S.Ct., at 2092 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring), id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2098 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2101 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment), see ante, at 2428, n. 4.6",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,190,"The Court now goes much further, overruling Lemon entirely and in all contexts. It is wrong to do so. Lemon summarized the cumulative criteria developed by the Court over many years of experience drawing lines as to when government engagement with religion violated the Establishment Clause. 403 U.S. at 612, 91 S.Ct. 2105. Lemon properly concluded that precedent generally directed consideration of whether the government action had a secular legislative purpose, whether its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and whether in practice it fosters `an excessive government entanglement with religion.' Id., at 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105. It is true that rigid application of the Lemon test does not solve every Establishment Clause problem, but that does not mean that the test has no value.

2021-061,191,"To put it plainly, the purposes and effects of a government action matter in evaluating whether that action violates the Establishment Clause, as numerous precedents beyond Lemon instruct in the particular context of public schools. See supra, at 2441-2443, 2443-2444. Neither the critiques of Lemon as setting out a dispositive test for all seasons nor the fact that the Court has not referred to Lemon in all situations support this Court's decision to dismiss that precedent entirely, particularly in the school context.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,193,"Upon overruling one grand unified theory, the Court introduces another: It holds that courts must interpret whether an Establishment Clause violation has occurred mainly by `reference to historical practices and understandings.' Ante, at 2428 (quoting Town of Greece, 572 U.S. at 576, 134 S.Ct. 1811 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here again, the Court professes that nothing has changed. In fact, while the Court has long referred to historical practice as one element of the analysis in specific Establishment Clause cases, the Court has never announced this as a general test or exclusive focus. American Legion, 588 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2091 (BREYER, J., concurring) (noting that the Court was appropriately `looking to history for guidance' but was not adopting a `history and tradition test').",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,194,"The Court reserves any meaningful explanation of its history-and-tradition test for another day, content for now to disguise it as established law and move on. It should not escape notice, however, that the effects of the majority's new rule could be profound. The problems with elevating history and tradition over purpose and precedent are well documented. See Dobbs, 597 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2325-2326 (BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting) (explaining that the Framers defined rights in general terms to permit future evolution in their scope and meaning), New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v.

2021-061,195,"For now, it suffices to say that the Court's history-and-tradition test offers essentially no guidance for school administrators. If even judges and Justices, with full adversarial briefing and argument tailored to precise legal issues, regularly disagree (and err) in their amateur efforts at history, how are school administrators, faculty, and staff supposed to adapt? How will school administrators exercise their responsibilities to manage school curriculum and events when the Court appears to elevate individuals' rights to religious exercise above all else? Today's opinion provides little in the way of answers, the Court simply sets the stage for future legal changes that will inevitably follow the Court's choice today to upset longstanding rules.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,197,"Finally, the Court acknowledges that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from coercing people to engage in religion practice, ante, at 2428-2429, but its analysis of coercion misconstrues both the record and this Court's precedents.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,198,"The Court claims that the District never raised coercion concerns simply because  the District conceded that there was `no evidence that students were directly coerced to pray with Kennedy.' Ante, at 2429 (emphasis added). The Court's suggestion that coercion must be direct to be cognizable under the Establishment Clause is contrary to long-established precedent. The Court repeatedly has recognized that indirect coercion may raise serious establishment concerns, and that there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools. Lee, 505 U.S. at 592, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (opinion of the Court), see also supra, at 2442-2443. Tellingly, none of this Court's major cases involving school prayer concerned school practices that required students to do any more than listen silently to prayers, and some did not even formally require students to listen, instead providing that attendance was not mandatory. See Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 296-298, 120 S.Ct. 2266, Lee, 505 U.S. at 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649, Wallace, 472 U.S. at 40, 105 S.Ct. 2479, School Dist. of Abington Township, 374 U.S. at 205, 83 S.Ct. 1560, Engel, 370 U.S. at 422, 82 S.Ct. 1261. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that the practices were coercive as a constitutional matter.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,199,"Today's Court quotes the Lee Court's remark that enduring others' speech is `part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society.' Ante, at 2430 (quoting Lee, 505 U.S. at 590, 112 S.Ct. 2649). The Lee Court, however, expressly concluded, in the very same paragraph, that this argument cannot prevail in the school-prayer context because the notion that being subject to a brief prayer in school is acceptable overlooks a fundamental dynamic of the Constitution: its specific prohibition on  state intervention in religious affairs. Id., at 591, 112 S.Ct. 2649, see also id., at 594, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (The government may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use more direct means).7",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,200,"The Court also distinguishes Santa Fe because Kennedy's prayers were not publicly broadcast or recited to a captive audience. Ante, at 2432. This misses the point. In Santa Fe, a student council chaplain delivered a prayer over the public-address system before each varsity football game of the season. 530 U.S. at 294, 120 S.Ct. 2266. Students were not required as a general matter to attend the games, but cheerleaders, members of the band, and, of course, the team members themselves were, and the Court would have found an improper effect of coercing those present even if it regarded every high school student's decision to attend  as purely voluntary. Id., at 311-312, 120 S.Ct. 2266. Kennedy's prayers raise precisely the same concerns. His prayers did not need to be broadcast. His actions spoke louder than his words. His prayers were intentionally, visually demonstrative to an audience aware of their history and no less captive than the audience in Santa Fe, with spectators watching and some players perhaps engaged in a song, but all waiting to rejoin their coach for a postgame talk. Moreover, Kennedy's prayers had a greater coercive potential because they were delivered not by a student, but by their coach, who was still on active duty for postgame events.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,201,"In addition, despite the direct record evidence that students felt coerced to participate in Kennedy's prayers, the Court nonetheless concludes that coercion was not present in any event because Kennedy did not seek to direct any prayers to students or require anyone else to participate. Ante, at 2429, see also ante, at 2432, n. 7 (contending that the fact that students might choose, unprompted, to participate in their coach's on-the-field prayers does not necessarily prove them coercive). But nowhere does the Court engage with the unique coercive power of a coach's actions on his adolescent players.8",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,202,"In any event, the Court makes this assertion only by drawing a bright line between Kennedy's yearslong practice of leading student prayers, which the Court does not defend, and Kennedy's final three prayers, which BHS students did not join, but student peers from the other teams did. See ante, at 2429-2430 (distinguishing Kennedy's prior practice and focusing narrowly on three prayers  in October 2015). As discussed above, see supra, at 2443-2444, this mode of analysis contravenes precedent by turning a blind eye to the context in which Kennedy's practice arose, Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 315, 120 S.Ct. 2266.9 This Court's precedents require a more nuanced inquiry into the realities of coercion in the specific school context concerned than the majority recognizes today. The question before the Court is not whether a coach taking a knee to pray on the field would constitute an Establishment Clause violation in any and all circumstances. It is whether permitting Kennedy to continue a demonstrative prayer practice at the center of the football field after years of inappropriately leading students in prayer in the same spot, at that same time, and in the same manner, which led students to feel compelled to join him, violates the Establishment Clause. It does.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,203,"Having disregarded this context, the Court finds Kennedy's three-game practice distinguishable from precedent because the prayers were quiet and the students were otherwise occupied. Ante, at 2429-2430. The record contradicts this narrative. Even on the Court's myopic framing of the facts, at two of the three games on which the Court focuses, players witnessed student peers from the other team and other authority figures surrounding Kennedy and joining him in  prayer. The coercive pressures inherent in such a situation are obvious. Moreover, Kennedy's actual demand to the District was that he give verbal prayers specifically at the midfield position where he traditionally led team prayers, and that students be allowed to join him voluntarily and pray. App. 64, 69-71. Notably, the Court today does not embrace this demand, but it nonetheless rejects the District's right to ensure that students were not pressured to pray.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,204,"To reiterate, the District did not argue, and neither court below held, that any visible religious conduct by a teacher or coach should be deemed  impermissibly coercive on students. Ante, at 2431. Nor has anyone contended that a coach may never visibly pray on the field. The courts below simply recognized that Kennedy continued to initiate prayers visible to students, while still on duty during school events, under the exact same circumstances as his past practice of leading student prayer. It is unprecedented for the Court to hold that this conduct, taken as a whole, did not raise cognizable coercion concerns. Importantly, nothing in the Court's opinion should be read as calling into question that Kennedy's conduct may have raised other concerns regarding disruption of school events or misuse of school facilities that would have separately justified employment action against Kennedy.* * *",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,205,"The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause are equally integral in protecting religious freedom in our society. The first serves as a promise from our government, while the second erects a backstop that disables our government from breaking it and starting us down the path to the past, when the right to free exercise was routinely abridged. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 2012, 2041, 198 L.Ed.2d 551 (2017) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-061,206,"Today, the Court once again weakens the backstop. It elevates one individual's interest in personal religious exercise, in the exact time and place of that individual's choosing, over society's interest in protecting the separation between church and state, eroding the protections for religious liberty for all. Today's decision is particularly misguided because it elevates the religious rights of a school official, who voluntarily accepted public employment and the limits that public employment entails, over those of his students, who are required to attend school and who this Court has long recognized are particularly vulnerable and deserving of protection. In doing so, the Court sets us further down a perilous path in forcing States to entangle themselves with religion, with all of our rights hanging in the balance. As much as the Court protests otherwise, today's decision is no victory for religious liberty. I respectfully dissent.",Sotomayor,0,

In McGirt, the Court held that Congress had never properly disestablished the Creek Nation's reservation in eastern Oklahoma. As a result, the Court concluded that the Creek Reservation remained Indian country. Id., at ___ - ___, ___, ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2459-2460, 2467-2468, 2474. The status of that part of Oklahoma as Indian country meant that different jurisdictional rules might apply for the prosecution of criminal offenses in that area. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1151-1153. Based on McGirt's reasoning, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals later recognized that several other Indian reservations in Oklahoma had likewise never been  properly disestablished. See, e.g., State ex rel. Matloff v. Wallace, 2021 OKCR 21, ¶15, 497 P.3d 686, 689 (reaffirming recognition of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Reservations), Grayson v.

This case is an example: a crime committed in what is now recognized as Indian country (Tulsa) by a non-Indian (Castro-Huerta) against an Indian (his stepdaughter). All agree that the Federal Government has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The question is whether the Federal Government's jurisdiction is exclusive, or whether the State also has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,38,"In the wake of McGirt, Castro-Huerta argued that the Federal Government's jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by a non-Indian against an Indian in Indian country is exclusive and that the State therefore lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with Castro-Huerta. Relying on an earlier Oklahoma decision holding that the federal General Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction, the court ruled that the State did not have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. The court therefore vacated Castro-Huerta's conviction. No. F-2017-1203 (Apr. 29, 2021), see also Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P. 3d 286, Roth v. State, 2021 OKCR 27, 499 P.3d 23.",Kavanaugh,0,

The Oklahoma courts have reversed numerous state convictions on that same jurisdictional ground.

Going forward, the State estimates that it will have to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to the Federal and Tribal Governments. All of this has created a significant challenge for the Federal Government and for the people of Oklahoma.

But otherwise, as a matter of state sovereignty, a State has jurisdiction over all of its territory, including Indian country. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 10.

2021-062,67,"First, Castro-Huerta advances what he describes as a textual argument. He contends that the text of the General Crimes Act makes Indian country the jurisdictional equivalent of a federal enclave.

2021-062,69,"Castro-Huerta's argument also directly contradicts this Court's precedents. As far back as 1891, the Court stated that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction in the General Crimes Act is only used in the description of the laws which are extended to Indian country, not to the jurisdiction extended over the Indian country. In re Wilson, 140 U.S. 575, 578, 11 S.Ct. 870, 35 L.Ed. 513 (1891). The Court repeated that analysis in 1913, concluding that the phrase sole and exclusive jurisdiction is used in order to describe the laws of the United States which by that  section are extended to the Indian country.

2021-062,71,"Moreover, if Castro-Huerta's interpretation of the General Crimes Act were correct, then the Act would preclude States from prosecuting any crimes in Indian country—presumably even those crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians—just as States ordinarily cannot prosecute crimes committed in federal enclaves. But this Court has long held that States may prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country. See McBratney, 104 U.S. at 623-624, Draper, 164 U.S. at 242-246, 17 S.Ct. 107. Those holdings, too, contravene Castro-Huerta's argument regarding the General Crimes Act.",Kavanaugh,0,

He asserts that the Major Crimes Act grants the Federal Government exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country. But the Major Crimes Act contains substantially different language than the General Crimes Act. Unlike the General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes Act says that defendants in Indian country shall be subject to the same law as defendants in federal enclaves. See 18 U.S.C. § 1153 (Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of certain major offenses shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States). So even assuming that the text of the Major Crimes Act provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over major crimes committed by Indians in Indian country, see, e.g., United States v. John, 437 U.S. 634, 651, and n. 22, 98 S.Ct. 2541, 57 L.Ed.2d 489 (1978), Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99, 103, 113 S.Ct. 1119, 122 L.Ed.2d 457 (1993), that conclusion does not translate to the differently worded General Crimes Act.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,73,"In short, the General Crimes Act does not treat Indian country as the equivalent of a federal enclave for jurisdictional purposes. Nor does the Act make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state law in Indian country.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,74,"Second, Castro-Huerta contends that, regardless of the statutory text, Congress implicitly intended for the General Crimes Act to provide the Federal Government with exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,75,"The fundamental problem with Castro-Huerta's implicit intent argument is that the text of the General Crimes Act says no such thing. Congress expresses its intentions through statutory text passed by both Houses and signed by the President (or passed over a Presidential veto). As this Court has repeatedly stated, the text of a law controls over purported legislative intentions unmoored from any statutory text. The Court may not replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent. Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 334, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010). Rather, the Court will presume more modestly that the legislature says what it means and means what it says. Henson v. Santander Consumer  USA Inc., 582 U.S. 79, ___, 137 S.Ct. 1718, 1725, 198 L.Ed.2d 177 (2017) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), see, e.g., McGirt, 591 U.S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2465 (Wishes are not laws), Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1894, 1907, 204 L.Ed.2d 377 (2019) (lead opinion) (The Supremacy Clause cannot be deployed to elevate abstract and unenacted legislative desires above state law), Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 287-288, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (The Court does not give dispositive weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in light of the contemporary legal context, because we begin (and find that we can end) our search for Congress's intent with  text and structure (internal quotation marks omitted)), Central Bank of Denver, N.

2021-062,76,"To buttress his implicit intent argument, Castro-Huerta seizes on the history of the General Crimes Act. At the time of the Act's earliest iterations in 1817 and 1834, Indian country was separate from the States. Therefore, at that time, state law did not apply in Indian country—in the same way that New York law would not ordinarily have applied in New Jersey. But territorial separation—not jurisdictional preemption by the General Crimes Act— was the reason that state authority did not extend to Indian country at that time.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,77,"Because Congress operated under a different territorial paradigm in 1817 and 1834, it had no reason at that time to consider whether to preempt preexisting or lawfully assumed state criminal authority in Indian country. For present purposes, the fundamental point is that the text of the General Crimes Act does not preempt state law. And this Court does not rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that  it never faced. Henson, 582 U.S., at ___, 137 S.Ct., at 1725. The history of territorial separation during the early years of the Republic is not a license or excuse to rewrite the text of the General Crimes Act.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,78,"As noted above, the Worcester-era understanding of Indian country as separate from the State was abandoned later in the 1800s. After that change, Indian country in each State became part of that State's territory. But Congress did not alter the General Crimes Act to make federal criminal jurisdiction exclusive in Indian country. To this day, the text of the General Crimes Act still does not make federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,79,"In 1882, in McBratney, moreover, this Court held that States have jurisdiction to prosecute at least some crimes committed in Indian country. Since 1882, therefore, Congress has been specifically aware that state criminal laws apply to some extent in Indian country. Yet since then, Congress has never enacted new legislation that would render federal jurisdiction exclusive or preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians in Indian country. Additionally, in 1979, the Office of Legal Counsel stated that this Court had not resolved the specific issue of state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, and that the issue was not settled. 3 Op. OLC 111, 117-119 (1979). Yet Congress still did not act to make federal jurisdiction exclusive or to preempt state jurisdiction.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,80,"On a different tack, Castro-Huerta invokes the reenactment canon. Castro-Huerta points out that, in 1948, Congress recodified the General Crimes Act. Two years before that recodification, this Court  suggested in dicta that States lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. See Williams v. United States, 327 U.S. 711, 714, 66 S.Ct. 778, 90 L.Ed. 962 (1946). Castro-Huerta contends that the 1948 Congress therefore intended to ratify the Williams dicta.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,81,"Castro-Huerta's reenactment-canon argument is misplaced. First of all, the reenactment canon does not override clear statutory language of the kind present in the General Crimes Act. See BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1532, 1541, 209 L.Ed.2d 631 (2021). In addition, the canon does not apply to dicta. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 349, 351, n. 12, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005). The Court's statements in Williams were pure dicta. Indeed, the Williams dicta did not even purport to interpret the text of the General Crimes Act. Dicta that does not analyze the relevant statutory provision cannot be said to have resolved the statute's meaning. Moreover, any inference from Congress's 1948 recodification is especially weak because that recodification was not specific to the General Crimes Act, but instead was simply a general recodification of all federal criminal laws. This Court has previously explained that the function of the 1948 recodification was generally limited to that of consolidation and codification. Muniz v. Hoffman, 422 U.S. 454, 474, 95 S.Ct. 2178, 45 L.Ed.2d 319 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court does not infer that Congress, in revising and consolidating the laws, intended to change their policy, unless such an intention be clearly expressed. Id., at 470, 95 S.Ct. 2178 (internal quotation marks omitted).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,82,"For many reasons, then, we cannot conclude that Congress, by recodifying the entire Federal Criminal Code in 1948, silently ratified a few sentences of dicta from Williams. The reenactment canon does not apply in this case.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,83,"Third, Castro-Huerta contends that the Court has repeated the 1946 Williams dicta on several subsequent occasions. But the Court's dicta, even if repeated, does not constitute precedent and does not alter the plain text of the General Crimes Act, which was the law passed by Congress and signed by the President. See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Alston, 594 U.S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2141, 2158, 210 L.Ed.2d 314 (2021).3  Moreover, there is a good explanation for why the Court's previous comments on this issue came only in the form of tangential dicta. The question of whether States have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country did not previously matter all that much and did not warrant this Court's review. Through congressional grants of authority in Public Law 280 or state-specific statutes, some States with substantial Indian populations have long possessed broad jurisdiction to prosecute a vast array of crimes in Indian country (including crimes by Indians). See Brief for National Congress of American Indians as Amicus Curiae 20, and n. 2. Indeed, Castro-Huerta notes that 21 States have jurisdiction over crimes `by or against' Indians in some Indian country. Brief for Respondent 7. So the General Crimes Act question—namely, whether that Act preempts inherent state prosecutorial authority in Indian country—was not relevant in those States.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,84,"In any event, this Court never considered the General Crimes Act preemption question. As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, many courts, without carefully considering the question, have assumed that Federal jurisdiction whenever it obtains is exclusive. We nevertheless believe that it is a matter that should not be regarded as settled before it has been fully explored by the courts. 3 Op. OLC, at 117. This case is the first time that the matter has been fully explored by this Court.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,85,"Until the Court's decision in McGirt two years ago, this question likewise did not matter much in Oklahoma. Most everyone in Oklahoma previously understood that the State included almost no Indian country. McGirt, 590 U.S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2498-2499 (ROBERTS, C.J., dissenting). But after McGirt, about 43% of Oklahoma—including Tulsa—is now considered Indian country. Therefore, the question of whether the State of Oklahoma retains concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indian on Indian crimes in Indian country has suddenly assumed immense importance. The jurisdictional question has now been called. In light of the newfound significance of the question, it is necessary and appropriate for this Court to take its first hard look at the text and structure of the General Crimes Act, rather than relying on scattered dicta about a question that, until now, was relatively insignificant in the real world.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,86,"After independently examining the question, we have concluded that the General Crimes Act does not preempt state jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,88,Castro-Huerta next invokes Public Law 280 as a source of preemption. That argument is similarly unpersuasive.,Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,89,"Public Law 280 affirmatively grants certain States broad jurisdiction to prosecute state-law offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country. See 18 U.S.C. § 1162. (Other States may opt in, with tribal consent. 25 U.S.C. § 1321.) But Public Law 280 does not preempt any preexisting or otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction that States possess to prosecute crimes in Indian country. Indeed, the Court has already concluded as much: Nothing in the language or legislative  history of Pub. L. 280 indicates that it was meant to divest States of pre-existing and otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction. Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U.S. 138, 150, 104 S.Ct. 2267, 81 L.Ed.2d 113 (1984). The Court's definitive statement in Three Affiliated Tribes about Public Law 280 applies to both civil and criminal jurisdiction. And the Court's statement follows ineluctably from the statutory text: Public Law 280 contains no language that preempts States' civil or criminal jurisdiction.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,90,"Castro-Huerta separately contends that the enactment of Public Law 280 in 1953 would have been pointless surplusage if States already had concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. So he says that, as of 1953, Congress must have assumed that States did not already have concurrent jurisdiction over those crimes. To begin with, assumptions are not laws, and the fact remains that Public Law 280 contains no language preempting state jurisdiction, as the Court already held in Three Affiliated Tribes. Apart from that, Public Law 280 encompasses far more than just non-Indian on Indian crimes (the issue here). Public Law 280 also grants States jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians. See Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook § 4.6, p. 250-251 (2021 ed.), cf. Negonsott, 507 U.S. at 105-107, 113 S.Ct. 1119. Absent Public Law 280, state jurisdiction over those Indian-defendant crimes could implicate principles of tribal self-government. See White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 142-143, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980), Part III-B, infra. So our resolution of the narrow jurisdictional issue in this case does not negate the significance of Public Law 280 in affording States broad criminal jurisdiction over other crimes committed in Indian country, such as crimes committed by Indians.4",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,91,"In any event, to the extent that there is any overlap (or even complete overlap) between Public Law 280's jurisdictional grant and some of the States' preexisting jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in Indian country, it made good sense for Congress in 1953 to explicitly grant such authority in Public Law 280. The scope of the States' authority had not previously been resolved by this Court, except in cases such as McBratney and Draper with respect to non-Indian on non-Indian crimes. Congressional action in the face of such legal uncertainty cannot reasonably be characterized as unnecessary surplusage. See Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. 954, 968-970, 203 L.Ed.2d 333 (2019). And finally, even if there is some surplusage, the Court has stated that redundancy is not a silver bullet when interpreting statutes. Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 873, 881, 203 L.Ed.2d 180 (2019).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,92,"In sum, Public Law 280 does not preempt state authority to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,94,"Applying what has been referred to as the Bracker balancing test, this Court has recognized that even when  federal law does not preempt state jurisdiction under ordinary preemption analysis, preemption may still occur if the exercise of state jurisdiction would unlawfully infringe upon tribal self-government. See Bracker, 448 U.S. at 142-143, 100 S.Ct. 2578, see also New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324, 333-335, 103 S.Ct. 2378, 76 L.Ed.2d 611 (1983). Under the Bracker balancing test, the Court considers tribal interests, federal interests, and state interests. 448 U.S. at 145, 100 S.Ct. 2578.5",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,95,"Here, Bracker does not bar the State from prosecuting crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,96,"First, the exercise of state jurisdiction here would not infringe on tribal self-government. In particular, a state prosecution of a crime committed by a non-Indian against an Indian would not deprive the tribe of any of its prosecutorial authority. That is because, with exceptions not invoked here, Indian tribes lack criminal jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians such as Castro-Huerta, even when non-Indians commit crimes against Indians in Indian country. See Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 195, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,97,"Moreover, a state prosecution of a non-Indian does not involve the exercise of state power over any Indian or over any tribe. The only parties to the criminal case are the State and the non-Indian defendant. Therefore, as has been recognized, any tribal self-government justification for preemption of state jurisdiction would be problematic. American Indian Law Deskbook § 4.8, at 260, see Three Affiliated Tribes, 467 U.S. at 148, 104 S.Ct. 2267, see also Hicks, 533 U.S. at 364, 121 S.Ct. 2304, McBratney, 104 U.S. at 623-624, Draper, 164 U.S. at 242-243, 17 S.Ct. 107.6",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,98,"Second, a state prosecution of a non-Indian likewise would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims. State prosecution would supplement federal authority, not supplant federal authority. As the United States has explained in the past, recognition of concurrent state jurisdiction could facilitate effective law enforcement on the Reservation, and thereby further the federal and tribal interests in protecting Indians and their property against the actions of non-Indians. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T. 1988, No. 603, p. 6. The situation might be different if state jurisdiction ousted federal jurisdiction. But because the State's jurisdiction would be concurrent with federal jurisdiction, a state prosecution would not preclude an earlier or later federal prosecution and would not harm the federal interest in protecting Indian victims.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,99,"Third, the State has a strong sovereign interest in ensuring public safety and criminal justice within its territory, and in protecting  all crime victims. See Dibble, 21 How. at 370. The State also has a strong interest in ensuring that criminal offenders —especially violent offenders—are appropriately punished and do not harm others in the State.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,100,"The State's interest in protecting crime victims includes both Indian and non-Indian victims. If his victim were a non-Indian, Castro-Huerta could be prosecuted by the State, as he acknowledges. But because his victim is an Indian, Castro-Huerta says that he is free from state prosecution. Castro-Huerta's argument would require this Court to treat Indian victims as second-class citizens. We decline to do so.7",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,102,"The dissent emphasizes the history of mistreatment of American Indians. But that history does not resolve the legal questions presented in this case. Those questions are: (i) whether Indian country is part of a State or instead is separate and independent from a State, and (ii) if Indian country is part of a State, whether the State has concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,103,"The answers to those questions are straightforward. On the first question, as explained above, this Court has repeatedly ruled that Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State. By contrast, the dissent lifts up the 1832 decision in Worcester v. Georgia as a proper exposition of Indian law. But this Court long ago made clear that Worcester rested on a mistaken understanding of the relationship between Indian country and the States. The Court has stated that the general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Worcester v. Georgia has yielded to closer analysis: By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations. On the contrary, it was said that a reservation was in many cases a part of the surrounding State or Territory, and subject to its jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law. Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 72, 82 S.Ct. 562.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,104,"Because Indian country is part of a State, not separate from a State, the second question here—the question regarding the State's jurisdiction to prosecute Castro-Huerta—is also straightforward. Under the Constitution, States have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within their territory except when preempted (in a manner consistent with the Constitution) by federal law or by principles of tribal self-government. As we have explained, no federal law preempts the State's exercise  of jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country. And principles of tribal self-government likewise do not preempt state jurisdiction here.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,105,"As a corollary to its argument that Indian country is inherently separate from States, the dissent contends that Congress must affirmatively authorize States to exercise jurisdiction in Indian country, even jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians. But under the Constitution and this Court's precedents, the default is that States may exercise criminal jurisdiction within their territory. See Amdt. 10. States do not need a permission slip from Congress to exercise their sovereign authority. In other words, the default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted. In the dissent's view, by contrast, the default is that States do not have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless Congress specifically provides it. The dissent's view is inconsistent with the Constitution's structure, the States' inherent sovereignty, and the Court's precedents.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,106,"Straying further afield, the dissent seizes on treaties from the 1800s. Post, at 2514-2515, and n. 4 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.).8 But those treaties do not preclude state jurisdiction here. The dissent relies heavily on the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, which stated that Indian country was separate from States, and which the dissent says was preserved in relevant part by the 1866 Treaty. See Treaty with the Cherokee (New Echota), Art. 5, Dec. 29, 1835, 7 Stat. 481, Treaty with the Cherokee, July 19, 1866, 14 Stat. 709. But history and legal development did not end in 1866. Some early treaties may have been consistent with the Worcester-era theory of separateness. But as relevant here, those treaties have been supplanted: Specific to Oklahoma, those treaties, in relevant part, were formally supplanted no later than the 1906 Act enabling Oklahoma's statehood. See Oklahoma Enabling Act, ch. 3335, 34 Stat. 267. As this Court has previously concluded, admission of a State into the Union necessarily repeals the provisions of any prior statute, or of any existing treaty that is inconsistent with the State's exercise of criminal jurisdiction throughout the whole of the territory within its limits, including Indian country, unless the enabling act says otherwise by express words. McBratney, 104 U.S. at 623-624, see Draper, 164 U.S. at 242-246, 17 S.Ct. 107. The Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such express exception. Therefore, at least since Oklahoma's statehood in the early 1900s, Indian country has been part of the territory of Oklahoma.",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,107,"The dissent responds that the language of the 1906 statute enabling Oklahoma's statehood itself established a jurisdictional division between the State and Indian country. See post, at 2515-2517 (discussing the Oklahoma Enabling Act). That argument is mistaken. This Court long ago explained that interpreting a statehood act to divest a State of jurisdiction over Indian country wholly situated within its geographical boundaries would undermine the very nature of the equality conferred on the State by virtue of its admission into the Union. Draper, 164 U.S. at 242-243, 17 S.Ct. 107. So the Court requires clear statutory language to create an exception to that rule. Id., at 244, 17 S.Ct. 107. To reiterate, the  Oklahoma Enabling Act contains no such clear language. Indeed, the Court has interpreted similar statutory language in other state enabling acts not to displace state jurisdiction. See id., at 243-247, 17 S.Ct. 107, Organized Village of Kake, 369 U.S., at 67-71, 82 S.Ct. 562. In Organized Village of Kake, the Court specifically addressed several state enabling acts, including the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and stated that statutory language reserving jurisdiction and control to the United States was meant to preserve federal jurisdiction to the extent that it existed before statehood, not to make federal jurisdiction exclusive. Id., at 67-70, 82 S.Ct. 562. Consistent with that precedent, today's decision recognizes that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.9",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,108,"The dissent incorrectly seeks to characterize various aspects of the Court's decision as dicta. To be clear, the Court today holds that Indian country within a State's territory is part of a State, not separate from a State. Therefore, a State has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Indian country unless state jurisdiction is preempted. With respect to crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country, the Court today further holds that the General Crimes Act does not preempt the State's authority to prosecute, that Public Law 280 does not preempt the State's authority to prosecute, that no principle of tribal self-government preempts the State's authority to prosecute, that the cited treaties do not preempt Oklahoma's authority to prosecute, and that the Oklahoma Enabling Act does not preempt Oklahoma's authority to prosecute (indeed, it solidifies the State's presumptive sovereign authority to prosecute). Comments in the dissenting opinion suggesting anything otherwise are just that: comments in a dissenting opinion. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 177, n. 10, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980).",Kavanaugh,0,
2021-062,109,"From start to finish, the dissent employs extraordinary rhetoric in articulating its deeply held policy views about what Indian law should be. The dissent goes so far as to draft a proposed statute for Congress.

Really, the prosecution was a show of force—an attempt by the State to demonstrate its authority over tribal lands. Speaking for this Court, Chief Justice Marshall refused to endorse Georgia's ploy because the State enjoyed no lawful right to govern the territory of a separate sovereign. See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832). The Court's decision was deeply unpopular, and both Georgia and President Jackson flouted it. But in time, Worcester came to be recognized as one of this Court's finer hours. The decision established a foundational rule that would persist for over 200 years: Native American Tribes retain their sovereignty unless and until Congress ordains otherwise. Worcester proved that, even in the courts of the conqueror, the rule of law meant something. Johnson's Lessee v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 588, 5 L.Ed. 681 (1823).",Gorsuch,0,

Litton, History of Oklahoma at the Golden Anniversary of Statehood 91 (1957) (Litton). The Cherokee were a distinct, independent political community, who retained their original sovereign right to regulate their internal and social relations. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 55, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,118,"As colonists settled coastal areas near Cherokee territory, the Tribe proved a valuable trading partner—and a military threat. See W. Echo-Hawk, In the Court of the Conqueror 89 (2010). Recognizing this, Great Britain signed a treaty with the Cherokee in 1730. See 1 Litton 92. As was true of tributary and feudatory states in Europe, the Cherokee did not cease to be sovereign and independent under this arrangement, but retained the right to govern their internal affairs. E. de Vattel, Law of Nations 60-61 (1805), see Worcester, 6 Pet. at 561. Meanwhile, under British law the crown possessed centralized authority over diplomacy with Tribes to the exclusion of colonial governments. See C. Berkey, United States-Indian Relations: The Constitutional Basis, in Exiled in the Land of the Free 192 (H. Lyons ed. 1992).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,119,"Ultimately, the American Revolution replaced that legal framework with a similar one. When the delegates drafted the Articles of Confederation, they debated whether the national or state authorities should manage Indian affairs. See 6 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789, pp. 1077-1079 (W. Ford ed. 1906). The resulting compromise proved unworkable. The Articles granted Congress the sole and exclusive right and power of  regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians. Art. IX. But the Articles undermined that assignment by further providing that the legislative right of any state, within its own limits, could not be infringed or violated. Ibid. Together, these provisions led to battles between national and state governments over who could oversee relations with various Tribes. See G. Ablavsky, Beyond the Indian Commerce Clause, 124 Yale L. J. 1012, 1033-1035 (2015) (Ablavsky). James Madison later complained that the Articles' division of authority over Indian affairs had endeavored to accomplish an impossibility, to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States. The Federalist No. 42, p. 269 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,120,"When the framers convened to draft a new Constitution, this problem was among those they sought to resolve. To that end, they gave the federal government broad general powers over Indian affairs. United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193, 200, 124 S.Ct. 1628, 158 L.Ed.2d 420 (2004). The Constitution afforded Congress authority to make war and negotiate treaties with the Tribes. See Art. I, § 8, Art. VI, cl. 2. It barred States from doing either of these things. See Art. I, § 10. And the Constitution granted Congress the power to regulate Commerce  with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Nor did the Constitution replicate the Articles' carveout for state power over Tribes within their borders. Madison praised this change, contending that the new federal government would be very properly unfettered from this prior limitation. The Federalist No. 42, at 268. Antifederalist Abraham Yates agreed (but bemoaned) that the Constitution totally surrendered into the hands of Congress the management and regulation of the Indian affairs. Letter to the Citizens of the State of New York (June 13-14, 1788), in 20 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 1153, 1158 (J. Kaminski et al. eds. 2004).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,121,"Consistent with that view, the Washington Administration insisted that the federal government enjoyed exclusive constitutional authority over tribal relations. Ablavsky 1019. The new Administration understood, too, that Tribes remained otherwise free to govern their internal affairs without state interference. See id., at 1041-1042, 1065-1067. In a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, President Washington stated curtly that the United States  posseses the only authority of regulating an intercourse with the Indians, and redressing their grievances. Letter to T. Mifflin (Sept. 4, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 396 (D. Twohig ed. 1996). Even Thomas Jefferson, the great defender of the States' powers, agreed that under the present Constitution no State has a right to Treat with the Indians without the consent of the General Government.

2021-062,122,"Nor was this view confined to the Executive Branch. Congress quickly exercised its new constitutional authority.

2021-062,123,"137. Congress also provided for federal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against Indians on tribal lands. §§ 5-6, id., at 138. States, too, recognized their lack of authority. See Ablavsky 1019, 1043. In 1789, South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney acknowledged to Washington that the sole management of Indian affairs is now committed to the general Government. Letter to G. Washington (Dec. 14), in 4 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 401, 404 (D. Twohig ed. 1993). Initially, even Georgia took the same view. See Letter from Georgia House of Representatives to Governor Edward Telfair (June 10, 1790), in 3 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution: Delaware, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut 178 (M. Jensen ed. 1978) (Microform Supp. Doc. No. 50).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,124,"It was against this background that Chief Justice Marshall faced Worcester. After gold was discovered in Cherokee territory in the 1820s, Georgia's Legislature enacted laws designed to seize the whole Cherokee country, parcel it out among the neighboring counties of the state  abolish the Tribe's institutions and its laws, and annihilate its political existence. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 542. Like Oklahoma today, Georgia also purported to extend its criminal laws to Cherokee lands. See ibid., see also S. Breyer, The Cherokee Indians and the Supreme Court, 87 The Georgia Historical Q. 408, 416-418 (2003) (Breyer). In refusing to sanction Georgia's power grab, this Court explained that the State's assertion of jurisdiction over the Cherokee nation was void, because under our Constitution only the federal government possessed the power to manage relations with the Tribe. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 542, 561-562.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,126,"Two years later, and exercising its authority to regulate tribal affairs in the shadow of Worcester, Congress adopted the General Crimes Act of 1834 (GCA). That law extended federal criminal jurisdiction to tribal lands for certain crimes and, in doing so, served two apparent purposes. First, as a courtesy to the Tribes, the law represented a promise by the federal government to punish crimes  committed  by and against our own non-Indian citizens. H. Rep. No. 474, 23d Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1834) (H. Rep. No. 474). That jurisdictional arrangement was also consistent with, and even seemingly compelled by, the federal government's treaties with various Tribes. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 731 (N. Newton et al. eds. 2005) (Cohen), R. Clinton, Development of Criminal Jurisdiction Over Indian Lands: The Historical Perspective, 17 Ariz. L. Rev. 951, 958-962 (1975) (Clinton). Second, because Worcester held that States lacked criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, Congress sought to ensure a federal forum for crimes committed by and against non-Indians. See H. Rep. No. 474, at 13. Otherwise, Congress understood, non-Indian settlers would be subject to tribal jurisdiction alone. See id., at 13, 18, R. Barsh & J. Henderson, The Betrayal, Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe and the Hunting of the Snark, 63 Minn. L. Rev. 609, 625-626 (1979). Congress reenacted the GCA in 1948 with minor amendments, but it remains in force today more or less in its original form. See 18 U.S.C. § 1152 (1946 ed., Supp. II).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,127,"Shortly after it adopted the GCA, the Senate ratified the Treaty of New Echota with the Cherokee in 1836. After the Tribe's removal from Georgia, the United States promised the Cherokee that they would enjoy a new home in the West where they could establish  a government of their choice. Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble, Dec. 29, 1835, 7 Stat. 478. Acknowledging the Tribe's past difficulties  under the jurisdiction and laws of the State Governments, the treaty also pledged that the Tribe would remain forever free from State sovereignties. Ibid., see Art. 5, id., at 481. These promises constituted an indemnity, guaranteed by the faith of the nation, that the United States and the Indian tribes would be the sole parties with power on new western reservations like the Cherokee's. H. Rep. No. 474, at 18 (emphasis in original).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,128,"Over time, Congress revised some of these arrangements. In 1885, dissatisfied with how the Sioux Tribe responded to the murder of a tribal member, Congress adopted the Major Crimes Act (MCA). See R. Anderson, S. Krakoff, & B. Berger, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary 90-96 (4th ed. 2008) (Anderson). There, Congress directed that, moving forward, only the federal government, not the Tribes, could prosecute certain serious offenses by tribal members on tribal lands. See 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a). On its own initiative, this Court then went a step further. Relying on language in certain laws admitting specific States to the Union, the Court held that States were now entitled to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians on tribal lands. See United States v. McBratney, 104 U.S. 621, 623, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1882), Draper v. United States, 164 U.S. 240, 243, 247, 17 S.Ct. 107, 41 L.Ed. 419 (1896). Through all these developments, however, at least one promise remained: States could play no role in the prosecution of crimes by or against Native Americans on tribal lands. See Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 220, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,129,"In 1906, Congress reaffirmed this promise to the Cherokee in Oklahoma. As a condition of its admission to the Union, Congress required Oklahoma to declare that it forever disclaims all right and title in or to  all lands lying within the State's limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation. 34 Stat. 270. Instead, Congress provided that tribal lands would remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States. Ibid. As if the point wasn't clear enough, Congress further provided that nothing contained in the new Oklahoma state constitution shall be construed to  limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States  respecting the State's Indians  which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed. Id., at 267-268. The following year, Oklahoma adopted a State Constitution consistent with Congress's instructions. Art. I, § 3, see also Clinton 961.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,130,"In the years that followed, certain States sought arrangements different from Oklahoma's. And once more, Congress intervened. In 1940, Kansas asked for and received permission from Congress to exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands. 18 U.S.C. § 3243. Through the rest of the decade, Congress experimented with similar laws for New York, Iowa, and North Dakota.1 Then, in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280. That statute granted five additional States criminal jurisdiction over offenses by or against Indians and established procedures by which further States could secure the same authority. See ch. 505, § 2, 67 Stat. 588. Ultimately, however, some of these arrangements proved unpopular. Not only with affected Tribes. See C. Goldberg-Ambrose, Public Law 280 and the Problem of Lawlessness in California Indian Country, 44 UCLA L. Rev. 1405, 1406-1407 (1997) (Goldberg-Ambrose).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,131,These arrangements also proved unpopular with certain States that viewed their new law enforcement responsibilities on tribal lands as unfunded federal mandates. See Anderson 436. A few States even renounced their Public Law 280 jurisdiction. See Cohen 579.,Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,132,"By 1968, the federal government came to conclude that, as a matter of justice and as a matter of enlightened social policy, the time had come to break decisively with the past and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions. Richard M. Nixon, Special Message on Indian Affairs (July 8, 1970). Consistent with that vision, Congress amended Public Law 280 to require tribal consent before any State could assume jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands. Act of Apr. 11, 1968, § 401, 82 Stat. 78, § 406, id., at 80 (25 U.S.C. §§ 1321(a), 1326). Recognizing that certain States' enabling acts barred state authority on tribal lands and required States to adopt constitutional provisions guaranteeing as much, Congress also authorized States to amend, where necessary, their State constitution or  statutes. § 404, 82 Stat. 79 (25 U.S.C. § 1324). In doing so, however, Congress emphasized that affected States could not assume jurisdiction to prosecute offenses by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they appropriately amended their State constitution or statutes. Ibid. To date, Oklahoma has not amended its state constitutional provisions disclaiming jurisdiction over tribal lands. Nor has Oklahoma sought or obtained tribal consent to the exercise of its jurisdiction. See The Honorable E. Kelly Haney, 22 Okla. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 90-32, 72, 1991 WL 567868, *1 (Mar. 1, 1991) (Haney). Thus, Oklahoma has remained, in Congress's words, a State not having jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country situated within its borders. 25 U.S.C. § 1321(a).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,134,"Rather than seek tribal consent pursuant to Public Law 280 or persuade Congress to adopt a state-specific statute authorizing it to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands, Oklahoma has chosen a different path. In the decades following statehood, many settlers engaged in schemes to seize Indian lands and mineral rights by subterfuge. See A. Debo, And Still the Waters Run 92-125 (1940) (Debo). These schemes resulted in the bulk of the landed wealth of the Indians ending up in the hands of the new settlers. See ibid., see also id., at 181-202. State officials and courts were sometimes complicit in the process. See id., at 182-183, 185, 195-196. For years, too, Oklahoma courts asserted the power to hear criminal cases involving Native Americans on lands allotted to and owned by tribal members despite the contrary commands of the Oklahoma Enabling Act and the State's own constitution. The State only disavowed that practice in 1991, after defeats in state and federal court. See Haney, 1991 WL 567868, *1-*3, see also State v. Klindt, 782 P.2d 401, 404 (Okla. Crim. App. 1989), Ross v. Neff, 905 F.2d 1349, 1353 (CA10 1990).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,135,"Still, it seems old habits die slowly. Even after renouncing the power to try criminal cases involving Native Americans on allotted tribal lands, Oklahoma continued to claim the power to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal reservations. The State did so on the theory that at some (unspecified) point in the past, Congress had disestablished those reservations. In McGirt v. Oklahoma, this Court rejected that argument in a case involving the Muscogee (Creek) Tribe. 591 U.S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2452, 2459, 207  L.Ed.2d 985 (2020). We explained that Congress had never disestablished the Creek Reservation. Nor were we willing to usurp Congress's authority and disestablish that reservation by a lawless act of judicial fiat. See id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2481-2482. Accordingly, only federal and tribal authorities were lawfully entitled to try crimes by or against Native Americans within the Tribe's reservation. Ibid. Following McGirt, Oklahoma's courts recognized that what held true for the Creek also held true for the Cherokee: Congress had never disestablished its reservation and, accordingly, the State lacked authority to try offenses by or against tribal members within the Cherokee Reservation. See Spears v. State, 2021 OKCR 7, ¶¶ 10-14, 485 P.3d 873, 876-877.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,136,"Once more, Oklahoma could have responded to this development by asking Congress for state-specific legislation authorizing it to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands, as Kansas and various other States have done. The State could have employed the procedures of Public Law 280 to amend its own laws and obtain tribal consent. Instead, Oklahoma responded with a media and litigation campaign seeking to portray reservations within its State—where federal and tribal authorities may prosecute crimes by and against tribal members and Oklahoma can pursue cases involving only non-Indians—as lawless dystopias. See Brief for Cherokee Nation et al. as Amici Curiae 18 (Cherokee Brief) (The State's tale of a criminal dystopia in eastern Oklahoma is just that: A tale).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,137,"That effort culminated in this case. In it, Oklahoma has pursued alternative lines of argument. First, the State has asked this Court to revisit McGirt and unilaterally eliminate all reservations in Oklahoma. Second, the State has argued that it enjoys a previously unrecognized inherent authority to try crimes within reservation boundaries by non-Indians against tribal members—a claim Oklahoma's own courts have rejected. See Bosse v. State, 2021 OK CR 3, 484 P. 3d 286, 294-295.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,138,"Ultimately, this Court declined to entertain the State's first argument but agreed to review the second. Nominally, the question comes to us in a case involving Victor Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian who abused his Cherokee stepdaughter within the Tribe's reservation. Initially, a state court convicted him for a state crime. After McGirt, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals determined that his conviction was invalid because only federal and tribal officials possess authority to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans on the Cherokee Reservation. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The federal government swiftly reindicted Mr. Castro-Huerta, and a federal court again found him guilty. Now before us, Oklahoma seeks to undo Mr. Castro-Huerta's federal conviction and have him transferred from federal prison to a state facility to resume his state sentence.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,139,"Really, though, this case has less to do with where Mr. Castro-Huerta serves his time and much more to do with Oklahoma's effort to gain a legal foothold for its wish to exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving tribal members on tribal lands. To succeed, Oklahoma must disavow adverse rulings from its own courts, disregard its 1991 recognition that it lacks legal authority to try cases of this sort, and ignore fundamental principles of tribal sovereignty, a treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, its own state constitution, and Public Law 280. Oklahoma must pursue a proposition so novel and so unlikely that in over two centuries not a single State has successfully attempted it in this Court. Incredibly, too, the defense of tribal interests against the State's gambit falls to a non-Indian criminal defendant. The real party  in interest here isn't Mr. Castro-Huerta but the Cherokee, a Tribe of 400,000 members with its own government. Yet the Cherokee have no voice as parties in these proceedings, they and other Tribes are relegated to the filing of amicus briefs.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,142,"Today the Court rules for Oklahoma. In doing so, the Court announces that, when it comes to crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within tribal reservations, Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction. Ante, at 2492-2493. But this declaration comes as if by oracle, without any sense of the history recounted above and unattached to any colorable legal authority. Truly, a more ahistorical and mistaken statement of Indian law would be hard to fathom.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,143,"The source of the Court's error is foundational. Through most of its opinion, the Court proceeds on the premise that Oklahoma possesses inherent sovereign power to prosecute crimes on tribal reservations until and unless Congress preempts that authority. Ante, at 2492-2501. The Court emphasizes that States normally wield broad police powers within their borders absent some preemptive federal law. See ante, at 2492-2494, see also Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1894, 1906, 204 L.Ed.2d 377 (2019) (lead opinion).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,144,"But the effort to wedge Tribes into that paradigm is a category error. Tribes are not private organizations within state boundaries. Their reservations are not glorified private campgrounds. Tribes are sovereigns. And the preemption rule applicable to them is exactly the opposite of the normal rule. Tribal sovereignty means that the criminal laws of the States can have no force on tribal members within tribal bounds unless and until Congress clearly ordains otherwise. Worcester, 6 Pet. at 561. After all, the power to punish crimes by or against one's own citizens within one's own territory to the exclusion of other authorities is and has always been among the most essential attributes of sovereignty. See, e.g., Wilson v. Girard, 354 U.S. 524, 529, 77 S.Ct. 1409, 1 L.Ed.2d 1544 (1957) (per curiam) (A sovereign nation has exclusive jurisdiction to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders), see also Schooner Exchange v.

2021-062,145,"Nor is this `notion,' ante, at 2493, some discarded artifact of a bygone era. To be sure, Washington, Jefferson, Marshall, and so many others at the Nation's founding appreciated the sovereign status of Native American Tribes. See Part I-A, supra. But this Court's own cases have consistently reaffirmed the point. Just weeks ago, the Court held that federal prosecutors did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause based on the essential premise that tribal criminal law is the product of a separate sovereign exercising its own retained sovereignty. Denezpi v. United States, 596 U.S. ___, ___, 119 S.Ct. 1573, ___, 143 L.Ed.2d 669 (2022) (internal quotation marks omitted). Recently, too, this Court confirmed that Tribes enjoy sovereign immunity from suit. See Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 788-789, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014). Throughout our history, the basic policy of Worcester that Tribes are separate sovereigns has remained. Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. at 219, 79 S.Ct. 269.2  Because Tribes are sovereigns, this Court has consistently recognized that the usual standards of pre-emption are unhelpful. White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 143, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980), see also Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 176, 109 S.Ct. 1698, 104 L.Ed.2d 209 (1989), Moe v.

Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 170-172, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973). In typical preemption cases, courts start with the assumption that Congress has not displaced state authority. Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). But when a State tries to regulate tribal affairs, the same backdrop does not apply because Tribes have a claim to sovereignty that long predates that of our own Government. McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 172, 93 S.Ct. 1257, see also Bracker, 448 U.S. at 143, 100 S.Ct. 2578. So instead of searching for an Act of Congress displacing state authority, our cases require a search for federal legislation conferring state authority: Unless and until Congress acts, the tribes retain their historic sovereign authority.

What is more, courts must tread lightly before concluding Congress has abrogated tribal sovereignty in favor of state authority. Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 60, 98 S.Ct. 1670. Any ambiguities in Congress's work must be resolved in favor of tribal sovereignty and against state power. See ibid., see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S. at 177, 109 S.Ct. 1698. And, if anything, these rules bear special force in the criminal context, which lies at the heart of tribal sovereignty and in which Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction among federal, tribal, and state authorities.

And, if anything, these rules bear special force in the criminal context, which lies at the heart of tribal sovereignty and in which Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction among federal, tribal, and state authorities.

2021-062,147,"From 1834 to 1968, Congress adopted a series of laws governing criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands. Those laws are many, detailed, and clear. Each operates against the backdrop understanding that Tribes are sovereign and that in our constitutional order only Congress may displace their authority. Nor does anything in Congress's work begin to confer on Oklahoma the authority it seeks.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,149,"Start with the GCA, first adopted by Congress in 1834 and most recently reenacted in 1948. The GCA provides:",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,150,"Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to Indian Country.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,151,"This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively. 18 U.S.C. § 1152.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,152,"As recounted above, Congress adopted the GCA in the aftermath of Worcester's holding that the federal government alone may regulate tribal affairs and States do not possess inherent authority to apply their criminal laws on tribal lands. Responding to that decision, Congress did not choose to exercise its authority to allow state jurisdiction on tribal lands. Far from it. Congress chose only to extend federal law to tribal lands—and even then only for certain crimes involving non-Indian settlers. Otherwise, Congress recognized, those settlers might be subject to tribal criminal jurisdiction alone. See Part I-B, supra. Several features of the law confirm this understanding. Take just three.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,153,"First, the GCA compares Indian country to places within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. § 1152. The latter category refers to federal enclaves like national parks and military bases that the Constitution places under exclusive federal control. See Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, United States v. Cowboy, 694 F.2d 1228, 1234 (CA10 1982), see also Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556, 567, 3 S.Ct. 396, 27 L.Ed. 1030 (1883). And state laws generally do not apply in federal enclaves. See, e.g., Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, 532-533, 5 S.Ct. 995, 29 L.Ed. 264 (1885). Rather than unambiguously endow States with any sort of prosecutorial authority on tribal lands, the GCA thus makes plain that tribal lands are to be treated like federal enclaves subject to federal, not state, control.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,154,"Second, the GCA provides that the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses shall apply on tribal lands. § 1152. Again, nothing here purports to extend state criminal laws to tribal lands. Quite the contrary. It would hardly make sense to apply federal general criminal law—to address all crimes ranging from murder to jaywalking—if state general criminal law already did the job. Traditionally, this Court does not assume multiple sets of general criminal laws apply to those subject to federal protection. Lewis v. United States, 523 U.S. 155, 163, 118 S.Ct. 1135, 140 L.Ed.2d 271 (1998). Instead, when Congress converts an area into a federal enclave, we usually presume later-enacted state law does not  apply. Parker Drilling Management Services, Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1881, 1890, 204 L.Ed.2d 165 (2019).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,155,"Third, after applying the federal government's general criminal laws to tribal lands, the GCA carves out some exceptions. It provides that federal law shall not extend to crimes involving only Indians, crimes by Indians where the perpetrator has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or where a treaty grants a Tribe exclusive jurisdiction. § 1152. These exceptions ensure that the federal government does not meddle in cases most likely to implicate tribal sovereignty. And it defies the imagination to think Congress would have taken such care to limit federal authority over these most sensitive cases while (somewhere, somehow) leaving States, so often the Tribes' deadliest enemies, to enjoy free rein. United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 384, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886).",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,157,"When Congress enacted the MCA in 1885, it proceeded once more against the backdrop rule that only tribal criminal law applies on tribal lands, that States enjoy no inherent authority to prosecute cases on tribal lands, and that only Congress may displace tribal power. Nor, once more, did Congress's new legislation purport to allow States to prosecute crimes on tribal lands. In response to concerns with how tribal authorities were handling major crimes committed by tribal members, in the MCA Congress took a step beyond the GCA and instructed that, in the future, the federal government would have exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes by Indian defendants on tribal lands. 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a), see also Part I-B, supra. Here again, Congress's work hardly would have been necessary or made sense if States already possessed jurisdiction to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal reservations. Plainly, Congress's purpose in adopting the MCA was to answer the objection that major crimes by tribal members on tribal lands would otherwise be subject to prosecution by tribal authorities alone. See Kagama, 118 U.S. at 383-385, 6 S.Ct. 1109.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,159,"Consider next the Treaty of New Echota and the Oklahoma Enabling Act. In 1835, the United States entered into a treaty with the Cherokee. In that treaty, the Nation promised that, within a new reservation in what was to become Oklahoma, the Tribe would enjoy the right to govern itself and remain forever free from State sovereignties and the jurisdiction of any State. Treaty with the Cherokee, Preamble, 7 Stat. 478. This Court has instructed that tribal treaties must be interpreted as they would naturally be understood by the Indians at ratification. Herrera v. Wyoming, 587 U.S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 1686, 1701, 203 L.Ed.2d 846 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). And having just lost their traditional homelands to Georgia, who can doubt that the Cherokee understood this promise as a guarantee that they would retain their sovereign authority over crimes by or against tribal members subject only to federal, not state, law? That was certainly the contemporaneous understanding of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, which observed that the United States and the Indian tribes would be the sole parties with power over new reservations in the West. H. Rep. No. 474, at 18, see also Part I-B, supra. This Court has long shared the same view. By treaties and statutes, the Court has said, the right of the Cherokee Nation to exist as an autonomous body, subject always to the paramount authority of the United States, has been recognized.

2021-062,160,"In 1906, Congress sought to deliver on its treaty promises when it adopted the Oklahoma Enabling Act. That law paved the way for the new State's admission to the Union. But in doing so, Congress took care to require Oklahoma to agree and declare that it would forever disclaim all right and title in or to  all lands lying within the State's limits owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation. 34 Stat. 270. Instead of granting the State some new power to prosecute crimes by or against tribal members, Congress insisted that tribal lands shall be and remain subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States. Ibid. Oklahoma complied with Congress's instructions by adopting both of these commitments verbatim in its Constitution. Art. I, § 3.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,161,"Underscoring the nature of this arrangement, the Enabling Act further provided that nothing contained in the Oklahoma constitution shall be construed  to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed. 34 Stat. 267-268 (emphasis added). Prior  to statehood, too, no one could have questioned Congress's exclusive authority to regulate tribal lands and affairs in the Oklahoma territory. See, e.g., U.S. Const., Art. IV, Kagama, 118 U.S. at 380, 6 S.Ct. 1109 (citing federal government's exclusive sovereignty over federal territories), Simms v.

Kleppe, 420 F.Supp. 1110, 1121 (DDC 1976) (federal courts had pre-statehood jurisdiction), Clinton 960-962.

2021-062,162,"Recognizing the point, this Court has explained that, in passing the enabling act for the admission of the State of Oklahoma Congress was careful to preserve the authority of the Government of the United States over the Indians, their lands and property, which it had prior to the passage of the act. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U.S. 286, 309, 31 S.Ct. 578, 55 L.Ed. 738 (1911) (emphasis added). This Court has explained, too, that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did nothing to disturb the long-settled rule that the guardianship of the United States over Native American Tribes in Oklahoma has not been abandoned. United States v. Ramsey, 271 U.S. 467, 469, 46 S.Ct. 559, 70 L.Ed. 1039 (1926). Instead, this Court has acknowledged, the federal government's authority in respect of crimes committed by or against Indians continued after the admission of the state as it was before. Ibid. In fact, the Court has long interpreted nearly identical language in the Arizona Enabling Act—enacted close in time to its Oklahoma counterpart —as reinforcing the traditional rule that the States lack jurisdiction on tribal lands over crimes by or against Native Americans.

2021-062,163,"The few occasions on which Congress has even arguably authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal reservations still do not come anywhere near granting Oklahoma the power it seeks. In the late 1800s, this Court in McBratney and Draper held that federal statutes admitting certain States to the Union effectively meant those States could now prosecute crimes on tribal lands involving only non-Indians. Yet, as aggressive as these decisions were, they took care to safeguard the rule that a State's admission to the Union does not convey with it the power to punish crimes committed by or against Indians. McBratney, 104 U.S. at 624, Draper, 164 U.S. at 247, 17 S.Ct. 107. Indeed, soon after Oklahoma became a State, this Court explained that the grant of statehood may have endowed Oklahoma with authority to try crimes not committed by or against Indians, but with statehood did not come any authority to try crimes by or against Indians on tribal lands.

2021-062,164,"The truth is, Congress has authorized the application of state criminal law on tribal lands for offenses committed by or against Native Americans only in very limited circumstances. The most notable examples can be found in Public Law 280 and related statutes. In 1940, Kansas successfully lobbied Congress for criminal jurisdiction in Indian country. Nearly identical laws for North Dakota, Iowa, and New York followed close behind. Then in 1953, Congress adopted Public Law 280 in which it authorized five States to exercise criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands and established procedures for additional States to assume similar authority. In 1968, Congress amended Public Law 280. Now, before a State like Oklahoma may try crimes by or against Native Americans arising on tribal lands, it must take action to amend any state law disclaiming that authority, then, the State must seek and obtain tribal consent to any extension of state jurisdiction. See Part I-B, supra, Clinton 958-962. Unless a State takes these steps, it does not have jurisdiction. 25 U.S.C. §§ 1321(a), 1323(b).6",Gorsuch,0,

The GCA and MCA? On the Court's account, Congress foolishly extended federal criminal law to tribal lands on a mistaken assumption that only tribal law would otherwise apply. Unknown to anyone until today, state law applied all along. The treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, and the provision in Oklahoma's constitution that Congress insisted upon as a condition of statehood? The Court effectively ignores them. The Kansas Act and its sibling statutes? On the Court's account, they were  needless too. Congress's instruction in Public Law 280 that States may not exercise jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members on tribal lands until they amend contrary state law and obtain tribal consent? Once more, it seems the Court thinks Congress was hopelessly misguided.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,167,"Through it all, the Court makes no effort to grapple with the backdrop rule of tribal sovereignty. The Court proceeds oblivious to the rule that only a clear act of Congress may impose constraints on tribal sovereignty. The Court ignores the fact that Congress has never come close to subjecting the Cherokee to state criminal jurisdiction over crimes against tribal members within the Tribe's reservation. The Court even disregards our precedents recognizing that the grant of statehood to Oklahoma did not endow the State with any power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands but reserved that authority to the federal government and Tribes alone. Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 469, 46 S.Ct. 559, see also Tiger, 221 U.S. at 309, 31 S.Ct. 578. From start to finish, the Court defies our duty to interpret Congress's laws and our own prior work harmoniously as part of an entire corpus juris. A. Scalia & B.

2021-062,169,"Putting aside these astonishing errors, Congress's work and this Court's precedents yield three clear principles that firmly resolve this case. First, tribal sovereign authority excludes the operation of other sovereigns' criminal laws unless and until Congress ordains otherwise. Second, while Congress has extended a good deal of federal criminal law to tribal lands, in Oklahoma it has authorized the State to prosecute crimes by or against Native Americans within tribal boundaries only if it satisfies certain requirements. Under Public Law 280, the State must remove state-law barriers to jurisdiction and obtain tribal consent. Third, because Oklahoma has done neither of these things, it lacks the authority it seeks to try crimes against tribal members within a tribal reservation. Until today, all this settled law was well appreciated by this Court, the Executive Branch, and even Oklahoma.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,170,"Consider first our own precedents and those of other courts. In 1946 in Williams v. United States, this Court recognized that, while States may have jurisdiction over offenses committed on the reservation between persons who are not Indians, the laws and courts of the United States, rather than those of the States, have jurisdiction over offenses committed there by one who is not an Indian against one who is an Indian. 327 U.S. 711, 714, 66 S.Ct. 778, 90 L.Ed. 962 (footnote omitted). In Williams v. Lee, issued in 1959, this Court was clear again: If the crime was by or against an Indian, tribal jurisdiction or that expressly conferred on other courts by Congress has remained exclusive. 358 U.S. at 220, 79 S.Ct. 269. As early as 1926, this Court made the same point while speaking directly to Oklahoma. Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 469-470, 46 S.Ct. 559. It is a point our cases have continued to make in recent years.7 It is a point a host  of other courts—including state courts issuing decisions contrary to their own interests—have acknowledged too.8",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,171,"The Executive Branch has likewise understood the States to lack authority to try crimes by or against Indians in Indian country absent congressional authorization. Not only did the Washington Administration recognize as much. See Part I-A, supra. The same view has persisted throughout the Nation's history. In 1940, the Acting Secretary of the Interior advised Congress that state criminal jurisdiction extends only to situations where both the offender and the victim are non-Indians. S. Rep. No. 1523, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2 (Vol. 2). A few decades later, the Solicitor General made a similar representation to this Court. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Arizona v. Flint, O. T. 1988, No. 88603, p. 3 (Flint Amicus Brief). In McGirt, the federal government once more acknowledged that States cannot prosecute crimes by or against tribal members within still-extant tribal reservations. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in McGirt v. Oklahoma, O. T. 2019, No. 18-9526, p. 38. In this case, the government has espoused the same view yet again.

2021-062,172,"In the past, even Oklahoma has more or less conceded the point.

It acknowledges that, at the  Nation's founding, tribal sovereignty precluded States from prosecuting crimes on tribal lands by or against tribal members without congressional authorization. See ante, at 2493. But the Court suggests this traditional `notion' flipped 180 degrees sometime in the latter half of the 1800s. Ante, at 2492, 2502.

2021-062,175,"But exactly when and how did this change happen? The Court never explains. Instead, the Court seeks to cast blame for its ruling on a grab bag of decisions issued by our predecessors. But the failure of that effort is transparent. Start with McBratney, which the Court describes as our leading case in the criminal context. Ante, at 2494. There, as we have seen, the Court said that States admitted to the Union may gain the right to prosecute cases involving only non-Indians on tribal lands, but they do not gain any inherent right to punish crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands. McBratney, 104 U.S. at 624. The Court's reliance on Draper fares no better, for that case issued a similar disclaimer. See 164 U.S. at 247, 17 S.Ct. 107. Tellingly, not even Oklahoma thinks McBratney and Draper compel a ruling in its favor. See Brief for Petitioner 12. And if anything, the Court's invocation of Donnelly, 228 U.S. 243, 33 S.Ct. 449, 57 L.Ed. 820, is more baffling still. Ante, at 2498-2499, n. 3.

Egan—which the Court seems to think is some magic bullet, see ante, at 2493, 2498-2499 n. 3, 2502, 2502-2504—addressed the prosaic question whether Alaska could apply its fishing laws on lands owned by a native Alaska tribal corporation. 369 U.S. 60, 61-63, 82 S.Ct. 562, 7 L.Ed.2d 573 (1962), see also n. 5, supra. Subsequently, the Court cabined that case to circumstances dealing with Indians who have left or never inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal self-government. McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 167-168, 93 S.Ct. 1257. Meanwhile, New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble allowed New York to use civil proceedings to eject non-Indian trespassers on Indian lands. 21 How. 366, 369-371, 16 L.Ed. 149 (1859). In Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, the crime at issue did not take place on tribal lands but on a supply station of the United States sold by Arkansas to the federal government. 281 U.S. 647, 649, 50 S.Ct. 455, 74 L.Ed. 1091 (1930). In New York ex rel. Ray v.

2021-062,177,"In the end, the Court cannot fault our predecessors for today's decision. The  blame belongs only with this Court here and now. Standing before us is a mountain of statutes and precedents making plain that Oklahoma possesses no authority to prosecute crimes against tribal members on tribal reservations until it amends its laws and wins tribal consent. This Court may choose to ignore Congress's statutes and the Nation's treaties, but it has no power to negate them. The Court may choose to disregard our precedents, but it does not purport to overrule a single one. As a result, today's decision surely marks an embarrassing new entry into the anticanon of Indian law. But its mistakes need not—and should not—be repeated.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,179,"Doubtless for some of these reasons, even the Court ultimately abandons its suggestion that Oklahoma is inherently free to prosecute crimes by non-Indians against tribal members on a tribal reservation absent a federal statute preempting its authority. Ante, at 2499. In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can require the exclusion of state authority even absent a preemptive federal statute. Ante, at 2500-2501. But then, after correcting course, the Court veers off once more. To determine whether tribal sovereignty displaces state authority in a case involving a non-Indian defendant and an Indian victim on a reservation in Oklahoma, the Court resorts to a Bracker balancing test. Ibid. Applying that test, the Court concludes that Oklahoma's interests in this case outweigh those of the Cherokee. All this, too, is mistaken root and branch.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,181,"Begin with the most fundamental problem. The Court invokes what it calls the Bracker balancing test with no more appreciation of that decision's history and context than it displays in its initial suggestion that the usual rules of preemption apply to Tribes. The Court tells us nothing about Bracker itself, its reasoning, or its limits. Perhaps understandably so, for Bracker never purported to claim for this Court the raw power to balance away tribal sovereignty in favor of state criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members—let alone ordain a wholly different set of jurisdictional rules than Congress already has.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,182,"Bracker involved a relatively minor civil dispute. Arizona sought to tax vehicles used by the White Mountain Apache Tribe in logging operations on tribal lands. See Bracker, 448 U.S. at 138-140, 100 S.Ct. 2578. The Tribe opposed the effort, pointing to a federal law that regulated tribal logging but did not say anything about preempting the State's vehicle tax. See id., at 141, 145, 100 S.Ct. 2578. The Court began by recognizing that the usual rules of preemption are not properly applied to Tribes. Id., at 143, 100 S.Ct. 2578. Instead, the Court started with the traditional `backdrop' presumption that States lack jurisdiction in Indian country. Ibid. And the Court explained that any ambiguities about the scope of federal law must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes as sovereigns. Id., at 143-144, 100 S.Ct. 2578. With these rules in mind, the Court proceeded to turn back the State's tax based on a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake. Id., at 145, 100 S.Ct. 2578. The Court judged that traditional notions of tribal sovereignty, the federal government's policy of promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and the rule requiring it to resolve ambiguities in favor of the Tribe trumped any competing state interest. Id., at 143-144, 151, 100 S.Ct. 2578.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,183,"Nothing in any of this gets the Court close to where it wishes to go. If Arizona  had to proceed against the traditional backdrop rule excluding state jurisdiction, Oklahoma must. And if Arizona could not overcome that backdrop rule because it could not point to clear federal statutory language authorizing its comparatively minor civil tax, it is unfathomable how Oklahoma might overcome that rule here. The State has pointed—and can point—to nothing in Congress's work granting it the power to try crimes against tribal members on a tribal reservation. In Bracker, the Court found it instructive that Congress had comprehensively regulated the harvesting of Indian timber, even if it had not spoken directly to the question of vehicle taxes. Id., at 145-146, 148, 100 S.Ct. 2578. Here, Congress has not only pervasively regulated criminal jurisdiction in Indian country, it has spoken to the very situation we face: States like Oklahoma may exercise jurisdiction over crimes within tribal boundaries by or against tribal members only with tribal consent.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,184,"The simple truth is Bracker supplies zero authority for this Court's course today. If Congress has not always been specific about the allocation of civil jurisdiction in Indian country, the same can hardly be said about the allocation of criminal authority. Cohen 527. Congress has provided a nearly comprehensive set of statutes allocating criminal jurisdiction. Ibid. In doing so, Congress has already balanced competing tribal, state, and federal interests—and its balance demands tribal consent. Exactly nothing in Bracker permits us to ignore Congress's directive.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,186,"Plainly, the Court's balancing-test game is not one we should be playing in this case. But what if we did? Suppose this Court could (somehow) ignore Congress's decision to allow States like Oklahoma to exercise criminal jurisdiction in cases like ours only with tribal consent. Suppose we could (somehow) replace that rule with one of our own creation. Even proceeding on that stunning premise, it is far from obvious how the Court arrives at its preferred result.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,187,"In reweighing competing state and tribal interests for itself, the Court stresses two points. First, the Court suggests that its balance is designed to help Native Americans. Ante, at 2501-2502 (suggesting that Indians would be second-class citizens without this Court's intervention), Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (suggesting state jurisdiction is designed to help tribal members). Second, the Court says state jurisdiction is needed on the Cherokee Reservation today because in the wake of McGirt some defendants have simply gone free. Ante, at 2492. On both counts, however, the Court conspicuously loads the dice.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,189,"Start with the assertion that allowing state prosecutions in cases like ours will help Indians. The old paternalist overtones are hard to ignore. Yes, under the laws Congress has ordained Oklahoma may acquire jurisdiction over crimes by or against tribal members only with tribal consent. But to date, the Cherokee have misguidedly shown no interest in state jursidiction. Thanks to their misjudgment, they have rendered themselves second-class citizens. Ante, at 2501-2502. So, the argument goes, five unelected judges in Washington must now make the right choice for the Tribe. To state the Court's staggering argument should be enough to refute it.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,190,"Nor does the Court even pause to consider some of the reasons why the Cherokee might not be so eager to invite state prosecutions in cases like ours. Maybe the Cherokee have so far withheld their consent  because, throughout the Nation's history, state governments have sometimes proven less than reliable sources of justice for Indian victims. As early as 1795, George Washington observed that a Jury on the frontiers considering a crime by a non-Indian against an Indian could hardly be got to listen to a charge, much less to convict a culprit. Letter to E. Pendleton (Jan. 22), in 17 Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 424, 426 (D. Hoth & C. Ebel eds. 2013). Undoubtedly, too, Georgia once proved among the Cherokee's deadliest enemies. Kagama, 118 U.S. at 384, 6 S.Ct. 1109.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,191,"Maybe the Cherokee also have in mind experiences particular to Oklahoma. Following statehood, settlers embarked on elaborate schemes to deprive Indians of their lands, rents, and mineral rights. Many young allottees were virtually kidnaped just before they reached their majority, some were induced to sign deeds at midnight on the morning they became of age. Debo 197-198. Others were subjected to predatory guardianships, state judges even rewarded their supporters with guardianship appointments. Id., at 183. Oklahoma's courts also sometimes sanctioned the legalized robbery of these Native American children through the probate courts. Id., at 182. Even almost a century on, the federal government warned of the possibility of prejudice against Native Americans in state courts. Flint Amicus Brief 5.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,192,"Whatever may have happened in the past, it seems the Court can imagine only a bright new day ahead. Moving forward, the Court cheerily promises, more prosecuting authorities can only help. Three sets of prosecutors—federal, tribal, and state—are sure to prove better than two. But again it's not hard to imagine reasons why the Cherokee might see things differently. If more sets of prosecutors are always better, why not allow Texas to enforce its laws in California? Few sovereigns or their citizens would see that as an improvement. Yet it seems the Court cannot grasp why the Tribe may not.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,193,"The Court also neglects to consider actual experience with concurrent state jurisdiction on tribal lands. According to a group of former United States Attorneys, in practice concurrent jurisdiction has sometimes created a pass-the-buck dynamic with the end result being fewer police and more crime. Brief for Former United States Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 13, see also C. Goldberg, Public Law 280: The Limits of State Jurisdiction Over Reservation Indians, 22 UCLA L. Rev. 535, 552, and n. 92 (1975), Goldberg-Ambrose 1423. Federal authorities may reduce their involvement when state authorities are present. In turn, some States may not wish to devote the resources required and may view the responsibility as an unfunded federal mandate. Thanks to realities like these, almost as soon as Congress began granting States criminal jurisdiction through Public Law 280, affected Tribal Nations began seeking retrocession and repeal. Brief for National Indigenous Women's Resource Center et al. as Amici Curiae 12. Recently, a bipartisan congressional commission agreed that more state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is often not a good policy choice. See Indian Law and Order Commission, A Roadmap for Making Native America Safer: Report to the President and Congress of the United States xi, xiv, 11-15 (Nov. 2013). Still, none of this finds its way into the Court's cost-benefit analysis.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,195,"Instead, the Court marches on. The second factor it weighs in its balance— and the only history it seems interested in consulting—concerns Oklahoma's account  of its experiences in the last two years since McGirt. Adopting the State's representations wholesale, the Court says that decision has posed Oklahoma with law-and-order challenges. Ante, at 2492-2493. To support its thesis, the Court cites the State's unsubstantiated estimate that McGirt has forced it to transfer prosecutorial responsibility for more than 18,000 cases per year to federal and tribal authorities. Ibid. Apparently on the belief that the transfer of cases from state to federal prosecutors equates to an eruption of chaos and criminality, the Court remarks casually that traditional limitations on state prosecutorial authority on tribal lands were insignificant in the real world before McGirt.

2021-062,196,"But what does this prove? Put aside for the moment questions about the accuracy of Oklahoma's statistics and what the number of cases transferred from state to federal prosecutors may or may not mean for law and order. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26 (questioning whether the State's figures might be grossly exaggerated). Taking the Court's account at face value, it might amount to a reason for Oklahoma to lobby the Cherokee to consent to state jurisdiction. It might be a reason for the State to petition Congress to revise criminal jurisdictional arrangements in the State even without tribal consent. But it is no act of statutory or constitutional interpretation. It is a policy argument through and through.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,197,"Nor is the Court's policy argument exactly complete in its assessment of the costs and benefits. When this Court issued McGirt, it expressly acknowledged that cases involving crimes by or against tribal members within reservation boundaries would have to be transferred from state to tribal or federal authorities. 591 U.S., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 2478-2482. This Court anticipated, too, that this process would require a period of readjustment. But, the Court recognized, all this was necessary only because Oklahoma had long overreached its authority on tribal reservations and defied legally binding congressional promises. See ibid.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,198,"Notably, too, neither the tribal nor the federal authorities on the receiving end of this new workload think the costs of this period of readjustment begin to justify the Court's course. For their part, Tribes in Oklahoma have hired more police officers, prosecutors, and judges. See Cherokee Brief 10-11. Based on that investment, Oklahoma's Tribes have begun to prosecute substantially more cases than they once did. See id., at 12-13. And they have also shown a willingness to work with Oklahoma, having signed hundreds of cross-deputization agreements allowing local law enforcement to collaborate with tribal police. Id., at 15-16, and n. 39. Even Oklahoma's amici concede these agreements have proved an important tool for law enforcement.

R. 2471, 117th Cong., 2d Sess., 78 (2022). Meanwhile, the Solicitor General has offered the Executive Branch's judgment that McGirt's practical consequences do not justify this Court's intervention, explaining that the Department of Justice is working diligently with tribal and State partners in Oklahoma.

And the Tribes—those most affected by all this supposed lawlessness within their reservations —tell us that, after a period of adjustment, federal prosecutors are now pursuing lower level offenses vigorously too. See Brief for Muscogee (Creek) Nation as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. 11-12, and nn. 21-22 (collecting indictments). The federal government has made a similar representation to this Court.

I do not pretend to know all the relevant facts, let alone how to balance each of them in this complex picture. Nor do I claim to know what weight to give historical wrongs or future hopes. I offer the preceding observations only to illustrate the one thing I am sure of: This Court has no business usurping congressional decisions about the appropriate balance between federal, tribal, and state interests. If the Court's ruling today sounds like a legislative committee report touting the benefits of some newly proposed bill, that's because it is exactly that. And given that a nine-member court is a poor substitute for the people's elected representatives, it is no surprise that the Court's cost-benefit analysis is radically incomplete. The Court's decision is not a judicial interpretation of the law's meaning, it is the pastiche of a legislative process.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,203,"As unsound as the Court's decision is, it would be a mistake to overlook its limits. In the end, the Court admits that tribal sovereignty can displace state authority even without a preemptive statute. See Part III-A, supra. To be sure, the Court proceeds to disparage a federal statute requiring Oklahoma to obtain tribal consent before trying any crime involving an Indian victim within the Cherokee Reservation. But look at what the Court leaves unresolved. The Court does not pass on Public Law 280's provision that States shall not be entitled to assume jurisdiction on tribal lands until they appropriately amend state laws disclaiming authority over tribal reservations. 25 U.S.C. § 1324. The Court gestures toward the Cherokee's treaties and the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but ultimately abandons any argument that those treaties were lawfully abrogated or that the Oklahoma Enabling Act endowed Oklahoma with inherent authority to try cases involving Native Americans within tribal bounds. See ante, at 2500-2501. Nor does the Court address the relevant text of those treaties or the Enabling Act—let alone come to terms  with our precedents holding that Oklahoma's grant of statehood did not include the power to try crimes committed by or against Indians on tribal lands. Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 469, 46 S.Ct. 559, see also Tiger, 221 U.S. at 309, 31 S.Ct. 578. Nothing in today's decision could or does begin to preclude the Cherokee or other Tribes from pressing arguments along any of these lines in future cases. The unamended Oklahoma Constitution and other state statutes and judicial decisions may stand as independent barriers to the assumption of state jurisdiction as a matter of state law too.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,204,"The Court's decision is limited in still other important ways. Most significantly, the Court leaves undisturbed the ancient rule that States cannot prosecute crimes by Native Americans on tribal lands without clear congressional authorization—for that would touch the heart of tribal self-government. Ante, at 2500. At least that rule (and maybe others) can never be balanced away. Indeed, the Court's ruling today rests in significant part on the fact that Tribes currently lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on tribal lands—a factor that obviously does not apply to cases involving Native American defendants. Ante, at 2501.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,205,"Additionally, nothing in the Bracker balancing test the Court employs foreordains today's grim result for different Tribes in different States. Bracker instructs courts to focus on the specific context at issue, taking cognizance of the particular circumstances of the Tribe in question, including all relevant treaties and statutes. 448 U.S. at 145, 100 S.Ct. 2578. Nor are Tribes and their treaties fungible. S. Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 1069, 1071-1072 (2004). There are nearly 600 federally recognized Indian Tribes across the country. See Anderson 3. Some of their treaties appear to promise tribal freedom from state criminal jurisdiction in express terms. See, e.g., Treaty with the Navajo, Art. I, June 1868, 15 Stat. 667 (guaranteeing that those who commit crimes against tribal members will be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States). Any analysis true to Bracker must take cognizance of all of this. Any such analysis must recognize, too, that the standards of preemption applicable in other areas of the law are unhelpful when it comes to Tribes. Bracker, 448 U.S. at 143, 100 S.Ct. 2578. Instead, courts must proceed against the `backdrop' of tribal sovereignty, ibid., with an assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation or other tribal lands, Williams, 358 U.S. at 219-220, 79 S.Ct. 269. To overcome that backdrop assumption, a clear congressional statement is required and any ambiguities must be construed generously in favor of the Tribes. Bracker, 448 U.S. at 143-144, 100 S.Ct. 2578, see also Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S. at 177-178, 109 S.Ct. 1698.",Gorsuch,0,
2021-062,206,"The Court today may ignore a clear jurisdictional rule prescribed by statute and choose to apply its own balancing test instead. The Court may misapply that balancing test in an effort to address one State's professed law and order concerns. In the process, the Court may even risk unsettling longstanding and clear jurisdictional rules nationwide. But in the end, any faithful application of Bracker to other Tribes in other States should only confirm the soundness of the traditional rule that state authorities may not try crimes like this one absent congressional authorization.10  Nor must Congress stand by as this Court sows needless confusion across the country. Even the Court acknowledges that Congress can undo its decision and preempt state authority at any time. Ante, at 2493-2494. And Congress could do exactly that with a simple amendment to Public Law 280. It might say: A State lacks criminal jurisdiction over crimes by or against Indians in Indian Country, unless the State complies with the procedures to obtain tribal consent outlined in 25 U.S.C. § 1321, and, where necessary, amends its constitution or statutes pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 1324. Of course, that reminder of the obvious should hardly be necessary. But thanks to this Court's egregious misappropriation of legislative authority, the ball is back in Congress' court. Ledbetter v.

2021-063,31,"In several recent decisions, this Court has set out rules for challenging a State's proposed method of execution under the Eighth Amendment. To prevail on such a claim, a prisoner must identify a readily available alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce the risk of severe pain. In doing so, the prisoner is not confined to proposing a method authorized by the executing State's law, he may instead ask for a method used in other States. See Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U.

Fifteen States, including Georgia, authorize only the use of lethal injection.1 Nine States authorize lethal injection plus one or more other specified methods, of those (to use an example relevant here), four approve the firing squad.2 And three States provide that if their authorized methods (including lethal injection) are found unconstitutional, then they may carry out a death sentence by any constitutional means.3",Kagan,0,

First, he must establish that the State's method of execution presents a substantial risk of serious harm—severe pain over and above death itself. Id., at 877, 135 S.Ct. 2726. Second, and more relevant here, he must identify an alternative method that is feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces the risk of harm involved. Ibid.

The Eighth Amendment, Bucklew explained, is the supreme law of the land, and the comparative assessment it requires can't be controlled by the State's choice of which methods to authorize.

2021-063,41,"Nance later brought suit under § 1983 to enjoin Georgia from using lethal injection to carry out his death sentence. As stated above, lethal injection is the only method of execution Georgia law now authorizes. See supra, at 2219.4 In his complaint, Nance alleges that applying that method to him would create a substantial risk of severe pain. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a. According to Nance, his veins are severely compromised and unsuitable for sustained intravenous access. Ibid. They are, Nance says, likely to blow during the execution, leading to the leakage of the lethal injection drug into the surrounding tissue and thereby causing intense pain and burning. Ibid. On top of that, Nance asserts, his longtime use of a prescription drug for back pain creates a risk that the sedative used in the State's lethal injection protocol will fail to render him unconscious and insensate. Ibid. Nance proposes, as a readily available alternative method of execution, death by firing squad. Ibid. As noted earlier, four other States have approved that method. See supra, at 2219, and n. 2. Use of a firing squad, Nance says, will lead to swift and virtually painless death. App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a. And implementing  that method, he says, would be simple: Georgia has enough qualified personnel and could borrow specific protocols from another State. Ibid.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,42,"After the District Court dismissed Nance's suit as untimely, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected it for a different reason—that Nance had used the wrong procedural vehicle. In the panel majority's view, Nance should have brought his method-of-execution claim by way of a habeas petition rather than a § 1983 suit. A habeas petition, the court stated, is appropriate when a prisoner seeks to invalidate a death sentence. 981 F.3d 1201, 1209 (2020). And the court thought that was what Nance was doing: The injunction he requested, preventing the use of lethal injection, necessarily implies the invalidity of his death sentence. Id., at 1203. That was so, the court reasoned, because Georgia law must be taken as fixed—and under that fixed law, if Nance could not be executed by lethal injection, then he could not be executed at all. Id., at 1211. The court therefore reconstrued Nance's complaint as a habeas petition. Id., at 1203. And having done so, the court dismissed the petition as second or successive because Nance had already sought federal habeas relief. 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b), see supra, at 2220-2221. Judge Martin dissented, arguing that Nance could proceed under § 1983. In her view, Nance was not challenging his death sentence, all he wanted was an order telling the State to execute him by a different method. 981 F.3d at 1215. The Eleventh Circuit denied Nance's petition for rehearing en banc over the dissent of three judges. See 994 F.3d 1335 (2021).",Kagan,0,

2021-063,45,"This Court has often considered, when evaluating state prisoners' constitutional claims, the dividing line between § 1983 and the federal habeas statute. Each law enables a prisoner to complain of unconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 480, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). But there the resemblance stops. The habeas statute contains procedural requirements (like the second-or-successive rule) nowhere found in § 1983, the former statute may therefore require dismissal of a claim when the latter statute would not. See id., at 480-481, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Still more pertinent here, the scope of the two laws also differs. Section 1983 broadly authorizes suit against state officials for the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution. Read literally, that language would apply to all of a prisoner's constitutional claims, thus swamping the habeas statute's coverage of claims that the prisoner is in custody in violation of the Constitution. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a), see Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 78-79, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). So we have not read § 1983 literally in the prisoner context. To the contrary, we have insisted that § 1983 contains an implicit exception for actions that lie within the core of habeas corpus. Id., at 79, 125 S.Ct. 1242.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,46,"In defining that core, this Court has focused on whether a claim challenges the validity of a conviction or sentence. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). The simplest cases arise when an inmate, alleging a flaw in his conviction or sentence, seeks immediate or speedier release from prison. Heck, 512 U.S. at 481, 114 S.Ct. 2364. The analogue in the capital punishment context, also clear-cut, is when an inmate seeks to overturn his death  sentence, thus preventing the State from executing him. Slightly less obvious, this Court has held that an inmate must proceed in habeas when the relief he seeks would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. Id., at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (barring § 1983 suits for money damages when prevailing would imply a conviction was wrongful). In doing so, though, we have underscored that the implication must be necessary. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. at 81, 125 S.Ct. 1242 (emphasis in original), see Nelson, 541 U.S. at 647, 124 S.Ct. 2117. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Court has held that a prison-conditions claim may be brought as a § 1983 suit. See Preiser, 411 U.S. at 498-499, 93 S.Ct. 1827. Such a suit—for example, challenging the adequacy of a prison's medical care—does not go to the validity of a conviction or sentence, and thus falls outside habeas's core.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,47,"In Nelson v. Campbell and Hill v. McDonough, this Court held two method-of-execution claims to fall on the § 1983 side of the divide. See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644-647, 124 S.Ct. 2117, Hill, 547 U.S. 573, 580-583, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006). Both cases involved challenges to a State's lethal injection protocol—the first to the use of a cut-down procedure to access the prisoner's veins, the second to a particular three-drug sequence. The cases predated our requirement that prisoners identify alternative methods, but each prisoner had said enough to leave the Court convinced that alternatives to the challenged procedures were available. See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 646, 124 S.Ct. 2117, Hill, 547 U.S. at 580-581, 126 S.Ct. 2096. And that made the difference in both cases. A claim should go to habeas, the Court held, only if granting the prisoner relief would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution. Nelson, 541 U.S. at 647, 124 S.Ct. 2117 (emphasis in original), see Hill, 547 U.S. at 583, 126 S.Ct. 2096.5 In neither case would it have done so. Each prisoner had asked only for a change in implementing the death penalty, and an order granting that relief would not prevent the State from executing him. So the claims could proceed under § 1983.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,48,"Both Nelson and Hill, though, reserved the question at issue here: whether the result should be different when a State's death-penalty statute does not authorize the alternative method of execution. See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 645, 124 S.Ct. 2117, Hill, 547 U.S. at 580, 126 S.Ct. 2096. In each case, the Court observed that using a different method required no change in the State's statute, but only a change in an agency's uncodified protocols. Here, all parties agree that Georgia would have to change its statute to carry out Nance's execution by means of a firing squad. They dispute whether that fact switches Nance's claim to the habeas track.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,49,"Except for the Georgia statute, this case would even more clearly than Nelson and Hill be fit for § 1983. Since those two cases, we have compelled a prisoner bringing a method-of-execution claim to propose an alternative way for the State to carry out his death sentence. He must, we have said, present a proposal that is sufficiently detailed to show that an alternative method is both feasible and readily implemented. Bucklew, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1129, see supra, at 2220. In other words, he must make the case that  the State really can put him to death, though in a different way than it plans. The substance of the claim, now more than ever, thus points toward § 1983. The prisoner is not challenging the death sentence itself, he is taking the validity of that sentence as a given. And he is providing the State with a veritable blueprint for carrying the death sentence out. If the inmate obtains his requested relief, it is because he has persuaded a court that the State could readily use his proposal to execute him. The court's order therefore does not, as required for habeas, necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution. Nelson, 541 U.S. at 647, 124 S.Ct. 2117 (emphasis in original). Rather, the order gives the State a pathway forward.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,50,"That remains true, we hold today, even if the alternative route necessitates a change in state law. Nance's requested relief still places his execution in Georgia's control. Assuming it wants to carry out the death sentence, the State can enact legislation approving what a court has found to be a fairly easy-to-employ method of execution. To be sure, amending a statute may require some more time and effort than changing an agency protocol, of the sort involved in Nelson and Hill. But in Hill, we explained that the incidental delay involved in changing a procedure— which even when uncodified may take some real work6—is not relevant to the vehicle question. 547 U.S. at 583, 126 S.Ct. 2096. Instead, that inquiry (as described earlier) focuses on whether the requested relief would necessarily invalidate, or foreclose the State from implementing, the death sentence. Ibid., see supra, at 2221-2222. And anyway, Georgia has given us no reason to think that the amendment process would be a substantial impediment. The State has legislated changes to its execution method several times before. See Dept. of Corrections, Office of Planning and Analysis, A History of the Death Penalty in Georgia: Executions by Year 1924-2014 (Jan. 2015) (describing how Georgia moved from hanging to electrocution to lethal injection). Other States have regularly done the same, often in an effort to make executions more humane. See S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History 296-297 (2002), see supra, at 2219. That Nance's claim would require such action does not turn it from one contesting a method of execution into one disputing the underlying death sentence.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,51,"The Court of Appeals could reach the contrary conclusion only by wrongly treating Georgia's statute as immutable. Recall the court's reasoning: Granting Nance relief would necessarily imply the invalidity of his death sentence because Georgia law (presumably both statutes and regulations) must be taken as fixed. 981 F.3d at 1210-1211, see supra, at 2221, post, at 2227-2228 (BARRETT, J., dissenting) (agreeing that we must take state law as we find it). But why must it be so taken—when as a matter of fact Georgia could change its law and execute Nance? And when Nance accepts the validity of the State's taking that course? The Court of Appeals posited that it is not a federal court's place to entertain complaints under section 1983 that would compel a State to change its capital punishment law. 981 F.3d at 1211, see post, at 2227. Except that sometimes it is. One of the main aims of § 1983 is to override —and thus compel change of—state laws when necessary to vindicate federal constitutional rights. Monroe v. Pape, 365  U.S. 167, 173, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), see Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 124, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). Or said otherwise, the ordinary and expected outcome of many a meritorious § 1983 suit is to declare unenforceable (whether on its face or as applied) a state statute as currently written. See, e.g., Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 594 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2063, 210 L.Ed.2d 369 (2021). And in turn, the unsurprising effect of such a judgment may be to send state legislators back to the drawing board. See, e.g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). A prisoner, no less than any other § 1983 litigant, can bring a suit of that ilk—can seek relief that would preclude a State from achieving some result unless and until it amends a statute.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,52,"And indeed, courts not uncommonly entertain prisoner suits under § 1983 that may, if successful, require changing state law. As noted earlier, the classic prisoner § 1983 suit is one challenging prison conditions —say, overcrowding or inadequate medical care. See supra, at 2221-2222. Those suits can be brought under § 1983 because—just like this one—they attack not the validity of a conviction or sentence, but only a way of implementing the sentence. (They concern, in other words, how the prescribed incarceration is being carried out.) And the suits do not get diverted into habeas if, as sometimes is true, a judgment for the inmate would require a new statutory appropriation for the prison —to hire more doctors, for example. See, e.g., Stafford v. Carter, No. 1:17-cv-00289 (SD Ind.), ECF Docs. 268, 282. Similarly, no one would think an action of that kind should go to habeas if the prison policy challenged (say, each facility's maximum population) were specified in a statute or regulation. Or consider another kind of prisoner § 1983 suit this Court has recently considered—one by a death row inmate seeking to compel the State to open the execution chamber to his spiritual advisor. See Dunn v. Ray, 586 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 661, 203 L.Ed.2d 145 (2019), Murphy v. Collier, 587 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1475, 203 L.Ed.2d 633 (2019), Gutierrez v. Saenz, 592 U. S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 1260, 209 L.Ed.2d 4 (2021), Ramirez v. Collier, 595 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 1264, 212 L.Ed.2d 262 (2022). Here too, the claim belongs in § 1983 because—just like this one—it challenges not the validity of a death sentence, but only the State's mode of carrying it out. And again, we cannot think it would matter if a State codified its no-spiritual-advisor protocol in a regulation. The State, assuming it lost the suit, would then have to modify its law to go forward with the execution. But the nature of the suit would still be the same. The complaint would still ask to adjust only a matter of implementation, so it still could be filed under § 1983.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,53,"Under the contrary approach, the federal vehicle for bringing a federal claim— and with that, the viability of the claim— would depend on the vagaries of state law. Consider how Nance's own method-of-execution claim would fare in different States. In Georgia (and any other State with lethal injection as the sole authorized method), he would have to bring his claim in a habeas petition. But in some other States primarily using lethal injection, he could file a § 1983 suit—because their statutes include back-up plans for when a court holds injection unconstitutional. See supra, at 2219. Oklahoma's statute, for example, provides in that event for several alternative methods, including a firing squad. See Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, §§ 1014(B)-(D). And Alabama's statute, in addition to listing alternatives, provides for execution by any constitutional method. Ala. Code § 15-18-82.1(c). Similar issues of non-uniformity could arise when inmates challenge,  as in Nelson and Hill, specific ways of carrying out a lethal injection. See supra, at 2222. That is because some States have codified injection protocols in their statutes or regulations, while others (like Georgia) have not. Compare, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. §§ 5-4-617(c)-(f) with, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. § 17-10-38(a). It would be strange to read such state-by-state discrepancies into our understanding of how § 1983 and the habeas statute apply to federal constitutional claims. And that is especially so because the use of those vehicles can lead to different outcomes: An inmate in one State could end up getting his requested relief, while a similarly situated inmate in another would have his suit thrown out. We cannot agree with the dissent that such a disparity would be unremarkable. Post, at 2227. Its acceptance would mean that the Eighth Amendment is enforceable in federal court in one State, but not in another. Again, this case tells the tale: Having reconstrued Nance's complaint as a habeas petition, the court below dismissed it as second or successive —a bar existing in habeas alone. See supra, at 2221-2222.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,54,"That part of the circuit court's opinion raises one last problem, because it threatens to undo the commitment this Court made in Bucklew. See post, at 2227-2228 (acknowledging the point, though finding it irrelevant). Recall that the Court there told inmates they could identify an alternative method of execution not presently authorized by the executing State's law. 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1128, see supra, at 2220. That option would ensure state law does not control the Eighth Amendment inquiry, and it would keep manageable the inmate's burden to identify an alternative. 587 U. S., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1128-1129. Under the circuit court's approach, however, that option is no option at all. Once an inmate presents an out-of-state alternative, he is relegated to habeas. And once he is in habeas, he will (according to the circuit court) almost inevitably collide with the second-or-successive bar (because a method-of-execution claim typically postdates a first habeas petition by many years). We do not here decide whether that view of the second-or-successive bar is correct. But the two aspects of the circuit court's ruling, when taken together, turn Bucklew into a sham. On the Eleventh Circuit's view, Georgia law effectively prevents an inmate like Nance from putting forward an out-of-state alternative. And Georgia law thereby precludes the kind of method-of-execution claim this Court told prisoners they could bring.",Kagan,0,
2021-063,55,"One last point from Bucklew— this one about dilatory tactics—bears repeating here. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1134. In recognizing that § 1983 is a good vehicle for a claim like Nance's, we do not for a moment countenance last-minute claims relied on to forestall an execution. Ibid. Courts should police carefully against attempts to use method-of-execution challenges as tools to interpose unjustified delay. Ibid. In deciding whether to grant a stay of execution, courts must consider whether such a challenge could have been brought earlier or otherwise reflects a prisoner's attempt at manipulation. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). And outside the stay context, courts have a variety of tools—including the substantive and procedural limitations that the Prison Litigation Reform Act imposes—to streamline § 1983 actions and protect the timely enforcement of a sentence. Nelson, 541 U.S. at 650, 124 S.Ct. 2117 (listing PLRA limitations), Bucklew, 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1133. Finally, all § 1983 suits must be brought within a State's statute of limitations for personal-injury actions. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). Here, the  District Court held Nance's suit untimely under that limitations period. See No. 20-cv-00107 (ND Ga., Mar. 13, 2020), ECF Doc. 26, p. 12, supra, at 2220-2221. The Eleventh Circuit did not review that holding because it instead reconstrued the action as a habeas petition. Now that we have held that reconstruction unjustified, the court on remand can address the timeliness question, as well as any others that remain.* * *",Kagan,0,

2021-063,59,"An inmate must bring a method-of-execution challenge in a federal habeas application, rather than under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, if a grant of relief to the inmate would necessarily bar the execution. Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 583, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006). Under this criterion, Michael Nance must proceed in habeas because a judgment in his favor would necessarily bar the State from executing him. Ibid. Nance asked the District Court to enjoin the Defendants from proceeding with his execution  by a lethal injection, claiming that the use of such method would violate the Eighth Amendment as applied to him. App. to Pet. for Cert. 103a-104a. But lethal injection is the only method of execution authorized under Georgia law. See Ga. Code Ann. § 17-10-38(a) (2020). Thus, if Nance is successful, the defendants in this case— the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections and the warden—will be powerless to carry out his sentence. That makes habeas the right vehicle for Nance's Eighth Amendment challenge.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,60,"The Court sees things differently. True, Nance is arguing that the Eighth Amendment renders his sentence invalid under current Georgia law. But the Court points out that the law could change: The legislature could authorize execution by firing squad, the alternative method that Nance has proposed. In fact, the Court says that Nance's proposal offers Georgia a veritable blueprint for carrying the death sentence out. Ante, at 2223. So an order in Nance's favor would not necessarily bar the State from ever executing Nance, in the Court's view. Instead, the order would give the State a pathway forward if the legislature chooses to pursue the amendment process. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,61,"The Court is looking too far down the road. In my view, the consequence of the relief that a prisoner seeks depends on state law as it currently exists. And under existing state law, there is no question that Nance's challenge necessarily implies the invalidity of his lethal injection sentence: He seeks to prevent the State from executing him in the only way it lawfully can.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,62,"In this respect, Nance's method-of-execution challenge differs from those brought in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004), and Hill, 547 U.S. 573, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44. In Nelson, the inmate challenged the use of a cut-down procedure to access his veins. 541 U.S. at 640-642, 124 S.Ct. 2117. We held that the suit sounded in § 1983 because it would not necessarily prevent Alabama from carrying out its execution. Id., at 647, 124 S.Ct. 2117. We reasoned that, though venous access was an indispensable prerequisite to lethal injection, a particular means of gaining such access was not. Id., at 645, 124 S.Ct. 2117. Notably, no Alabama statute required use of the cut-down, and the State did not put forward any duly-promulgated regulations to the contrary.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,63,"Id., at 646, 124 S.Ct. 2117. So even a successful challenge on these grounds would have allowed the State to proceed with the execution as scheduled. Ibid.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,64,"The same was true in Hill, which involved an inmate's challenge to Florida's three-drug protocol. 547 U.S. at 578, 126 S.Ct. 2096. We held that the inmate could proceed under § 1983 because his action if successful would not necessarily prevent the State from executing him by lethal injection. Id., at 580, 126 S.Ct. 2096. We emphasized that the complaint did not challenge the lethal injection sentence as a general matter but instead only the anticipated protocol. Ibid. As in Nelson, we stressed that Florida law did not require the department of corrections to use the challenged procedure. 547 U.S. at 580, 126 S.Ct. 2096. The State was free to use an alternative lethal injection procedure, and so we explained that under these circumstances a grant of injunctive relief could not be seen as barring the execution of Hill's sentence. Id., at 580-581, 126 S.Ct. 2096.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,65,"Here, by contrast, the warden and the commissioner are not free to use an alternative to lethal injection—so if Nance succeeds, they cannot carry out his sentence. And though the Court contends otherwise, that consequence switches Nance's claim to the habeas track. Ante, at 2222. An inmate can use § 1983 actions to challenge many, if not most, aspects of prison administration. But when a challenge would prevent a State from enforcing a conviction or sentence, the more rigorous, federalism-protective requirements of habeas apply. The Court finds a way around those requirements with a theory at odds with the very federalism interests they are designed to protect: that an injunction barring the State from enforcing a sentence according to state law does not really bar the State from enforcing the sentence because the State can pass a new law.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,66,"Unlike the Court, I would take state law as we find it in determining whether a suit sounds in habeas or § 1983. The Court worries that this approach would make the appropriate federal vehicle depend on the vagaries of state law. Ante, at 2218. Some States, like Georgia, provide for a single method of execution by statute, other States, like Alabama, allow for more flexibility. See ibid. So if state law determined the vehicle, an inmate in Georgia would have to challenge the lethal injection method in habeas, while an inmate in Alabama could use § 1983. But that does not illustrate the vagaries of state law, it is an unremarkable consequence of federalism. States make different choices in exercising their power to define punishment, and the law has long recognized a sovereign's interest in mandating a particular form of capital punishment. Cf. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 397 (1769) (a sheriff would be guilty of felony if he altered the manner of the execution). Habeas is appropriate in Georgia because under Georgia law, to enjoin execution by lethal injection is to enjoin enforcement of the sentence itself. See Ga. Code Ann. § 17-10-38(a) (All persons who have been convicted of a capital offense and have had imposed upon them a sentence of death shall suffer such punishment by lethal injection). In Alabama, enjoining execution by lethal injection does not have the same effect. See Ala. Code § 15-18-82.1(c) (2018) (permitting execution by any constitutional method of execution if the other methods provided for by statute are held unconstitutional). The two sovereigns have made different choices about how to define punishment, and federal law is designed to respect the choice of each.",Barrett,0,
2021-063,67,"I understand the impulse to find a way out of habeas and into § 1983. In States like Georgia, a claim under Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 1112,  203 L.Ed.2d 521 (2019), alleging an alternative method of execution not presently authorized by state law would be difficult to assert in a federal habeas application because it would almost inevitably collide with the second-or-successive bar. Ante, at 2225. But we acknowledged that very possibility in Bucklew. 587 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 1128. And more importantly, the unavailability of federal habeas relief does not justify recourse to § 1983. Cf. Wilkinson v.

The habeas statutes funnel such challenges to the state courts—which are, after all, the principal forum for them. Harrington v.

This meant that, in addition to their traditional judicial function of ruling on disputed matters in adversarial proceedings, bankruptcy judges dealt with an array of administrative tasks, such as appointing private trustees where appropriate, organizing creditors' committees, supervising the filing of required reports, schedules, and taxes, and monitoring cases for signs of abuse and fraud.

See id., at 17-18, Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2549. To render the separation of administrative and judicial functions complete, the pilot program transferred the administrative functions previously handled by the bankruptcy courts to newly created U.

As a result, Congress opted to expand mandatorily the Trustee Program to all federal judicial districts except for the six judicial districts in North Carolina and Alabama. Congress permitted only those six districts to continue judicial appointment of bankruptcy administrators, referring to that system as the Administrator Program. §§ 111-115, 302(d)(3), 100 Stat. 3090-3095, 3121-3123. The Administrator Program was scheduled to phase out in 1992, but Congress extended it by 10 years. § 317(a), 104 Stat. 5115. At the end of those 10 years, however, Congress did not phase out the Administrator Program. Instead, it eliminated the sunset period and permanently exempted the six districts from the requirement to transition to the Trustee Program, while providing that each district could individually elect to do so. § 501, 114 Stat. 2421-2422 (2000 Act), § 302(d)(3), 100 Stat. 3121-3123.

2021-064,35,"In 2017, concerned with a shortfall in the UST Fund, Congress enacted a temporary, but significant, increase in the fee rates applicable to large Chapter 11 cases. See Pub. L. 115-72, Div. B, 131 Stat. 1229 (2017 Act). The increase was set to take effect only if the UST Fund balance dropped below $200 million as of September 30 of the most recent fiscal year. If that condition was met, the increase applied on a quarterly basis to any debtors with a disbursement of $1 million or more during that quarter, regardless of whether their case was newly filed or already pending when the increase took effect. For those debtors, the maximum fee was increased from $30,000 a quarter to $250,000 a quarter. § 1004(a), id., at 1232. The statute provided that the fee raise would become effective in the first quarter of 2018 and would last only through 2022.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,36,"Despite the Judicial Conference's standing order, and unlike with previous fee increases, the six districts in the two States participating in the Administrator Program did not immediately adopt the 2017 fee increase. Only in September 2018 did the Judicial Conference order Administrator Program districts to implement the amended fee schedule. Even then, however, two key differences remained between the fee increase faced by debtors in Trustee Program districts as opposed to those faced by debtors in Administrator Program districts. First, the fee increase took effect for the six Administrator Program districts as of October 1, 2018, while the increase took effect for the Trustee Program districts as of the first quarter of 2018. Second, in Administrator Program districts, the fee increase applied only to newly filed cases, while in Trustee Program districts, the increase applied to all pending cases.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,37,"In 2021, Congress amended the statute governing parity of fees between Trustee Program and Administrator Program districts, § 1930(a)(7), to replace the word may with shall. See Pub. L. 116-325, 134 Stat. 5088. As a result, the statute now provides that the Judicial Conference shall require imposition of fees in Administrator Program districts that are equal to those imposed in Trustee Program districts. § 1930(a)(7). This change confirmed the longstanding intention of Congress that quarterly fee requirements remain consistent across all Federal judicial districts. Id., at 5086.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,39,"In 2008, Circuit City Stores, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Virginia, a Trustee Program district. In 2010, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a joint-liquidation plan, overseen by a trustee (petitioner here), to collect, administer, distribute, and liquidate all of Circuit City's assets. The liquidation plan required petitioner to `pay quarterly fees to the U. S. Trustee until the Chapter 11 Cases are closed or converted.' In re Circuit City Stores, 606 B.R. 260, 263 (2019). In 2010, when the plan was confirmed, the maximum quarterly fee was $30,000.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,40,"Circuit City's bankruptcy was still pending when Congress raised the fees for Chapter 11 debtors in Trustee Program  districts through the 2017 Act. Across the first three quarters after the fee increase took effect, petitioner paid $632,542 in total fees. Id., at 267, n. 20. Had Congress not increased fees, petitioner would have paid $56,400 over that same period. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,41,"Petitioner filed for relief against the Acting U. S. Trustee for Region 4 (respondent here, represented by the Solicitor General) in the Bankruptcy Court of the Eastern District of Virginia. Petitioner objected that the fee increase under the 2017 Act was nonuniform across Trustee Program districts and Administrator Program districts, in violation of the Constitution's Bankruptcy Clause. The Bankruptcy Court agreed, and directed that for the fees due from January 1, 2018, onward, the trustee pay the rate in effect prior to the 2017 Act. Id., at 270-271. The court reserved the question whether the trustee could recover any overpayments made under the 2017 Act. Ibid.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,42,"A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed. The court agreed that the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause applied to the 2017 Act, but it interpreted the Clause as forbidding only `arbitrary' geographic differences. 996 F.3d at 166. In the court's view, the fee increase permissibly applied only to Trustee Program districts because the UST Fund, which funded that program alone, was dwindling. Therefore, the court reasoned, Congress' effort to remedy that problem was not arbitrary. Judge Quattlebaum dissented in relevant part, interpreting the Bankruptcy Clause to preclude disparate treatment of bankruptcy districts unless the treatment was aimed at addressing issues that are geographical in nature. Id., at 175. In Judge Quattlebaum's view, the difference between Trustee Program districts and Administrator Program districts was arbitrary, as there was nothing geographically distinct about Alabama or North Carolina that justified a different approach in those states.

2021-064,46,"The Bankruptcy Clause empowers Congress to establish uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States. U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4. The first question before the Court is whether the 2017 Act is subject to the Bankruptcy Clause's uniformity requirement at all.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,47,"Respondent contends that the 2017 Act was not a law on the subject of Bankruptcies to which the uniformity requirement applies, but, rather, a law meant to help administer substantive bankruptcy law. Respondent interprets the Bankruptcy Clause as extending only to laws that alter the substance of debtor-creditor relations, such as laws that set priorities for claims or exempt property from an estate. Brief for Respondent 25. In respondent's view, the Necessary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 18, supplies the authority for Congress to pass a law auxiliary to a substantive bankruptcy law.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,48,"Nothing in the language of the Bankruptcy Clause itself, however, suggests  a distinction between substantive and administrative laws. This Court has repeatedly emphasized that the Bankruptcy Clause's language, embracing laws on the subject of Bankruptcies, is broad. For example, the Court has recognized that the subject of bankruptcies is incapable of final definition, and includes nothing less than `the subject of the relations between a debtor and his creditors.' Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 304 U.S. 502, 513-514, 58 S.Ct. 1025, 82 L.Ed. 1490 (1938). Without purporting to define the full scope of the Clause, the Court has interpreted the Clause to have granted plenary power to Congress over the whole subject of `bankruptcies,' and observed that the language used did not limit the scope of Congress' authority. Hanover Nat. Bank v. Moyses, 186 U.S. 181, 187, 22 S.Ct. 857, 46 L.Ed. 1113 (1902).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,49,"Nor has this Court ever distinguished between substantive and administrative bankruptcy laws or suggested that the uniformity requirement would not apply to both. Respondent argues that each of this Court's prior cases on the uniformity requirement has addressed what he terms substantive bankruptcy laws, Brief for Respondent 24, but these cases do not establish that the uniformity requirement only applies to such substantive laws. This Court has stated that the powers of the general grant of the Necessary and Proper Clause must be added to the Bankruptcy Clause's specific grant of power to Congress to legislate on the subject of bankruptcies. Wright, 304 U.S. at 513, 58 S.Ct. 1025. The Court has never suggested, however, that all administrative bankruptcy laws, Brief for Respondent 13, are enacted pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause, nor that the Necessary and Proper Clause permits Congress to circumvent the limitations set by the Bankruptcy Clause. To the contrary, the Court has held that Congress cannot evade the affirmative limitation of the uniformity requirement by enacting legislation pursuant to other grants of authority. Railway Labor Executives' Assn. v. Gibbons, 455 U.S. 457, 468-469, 102 S.Ct. 1169, 71 L.Ed.2d 335 (1982) (rejecting the contention that Congress could enact nonuniform bankruptcy laws pursuant to the Commerce Clause, because doing so would eradicate from the Constitution a limitation on the power of Congress to enact bankruptcy laws).",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,50,"Not surprisingly, all courts to have considered this question to date (even those that have found the 2017 Act constitutional) have accepted that the statute is subject to the Bankruptcy Clause's uniformity requirement. See In re Clinton Nurseries, Inc., 998 F.3d 56, 64, and n. 6 (CA2 2021) (collecting cases). The 2017 fee provision amended a statute titled Bankruptcy fees. 28 U.S.C. § 1930. The provision's effect is to set fees that must be paid by a bankruptcy trustee from the debtor's estate in a bankruptcy proceeding. The only subject of the 2017 Act is bankruptcy. Moreover, and importantly, the 2017 Act does affect the substance of debtor-creditor relations: Increasing mandatory fees paid out of the debtor's estate decreases the funds available for payment to creditors. As a result, the obligations between creditors and debtors are changed.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,51,"Respondent also argues that historic and modern congressional practice support the notion that bankruptcy fees are wholly exempt from the uniformity requirement. This argument glosses over the nature of the practices at issue. The historic examples respondent cites concern uniform federal laws allowing for local variation by delegating discretion to districts to establish their own procedures for certain bankruptcy matters, including fees, in view of local needs and conditions. See An Act to  Establish an Uniform System of Bankruptcy Throughout the United States, § 47, 2 Stat. 33 (1800) (providing that the district judges, in each district respectively, shall fix a rate of allowance to be made to the commissioners of bankruptcy), An Act to Establish a Uniform System of Bankruptcy Throughout the United States, § 6, 5 Stat. 446 (1841) (establishing that district courts may prescribe a tariff or table of fees and charges). Similarly, the contemporary laws respondent cites are uniform laws allowing for local determination of governing rules. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §§ 158(b)(1), (6) (providing that district courts may, but need not, participate in the bankruptcy appellate panel for its circuit if the circuit has created one). As discussed below, see infra, at 1780-1781, the uniformity requirement does not demand that Congress forbid or eliminate such local variation or choice.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,52,"The fee increase at issue here is materially different from these laws. It does not confer discretion on bankruptcy districts to set regional policies based on regional needs. Rather, Congress exempted debtors in only 2 States from a fee increase that applied to debtors in 48 States, without identifying any material difference between debtors across those States. The only difference between the States in which the fee increase applied and the States in which it was not required was the desire of those two States not to participate in the Trustee Program. The historical record therefore provides no support for respondent's argument that the uniformity requirement does not apply where Congress sets different fee structures with different funding mechanisms for debtors in different bankruptcy districts.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,54,"Having determined that the 2017 Act falls within the ambit of the Bankruptcy Clause, the Court must now decide whether the Act was a permissible exercise of that Clause.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,56,"Although the Bankruptcy Clause confers broad authority on Congress, the Clause also imposes a limitation on that authority: the requirement that the laws enacted be uniform. The Court has addressed the uniformity requirement on three occasions. Taken together, they stand for the proposition that the Bankruptcy Clause offers Congress flexibility, but does not permit arbitrary geographically disparate treatment of debtors.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,57,"The Court first addressed the uniformity requirement in rejecting a challenge to the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, which permitted individual debtor exemptions, including homestead and wage exemptions under state laws. Moyses, 186 U.S. 181, 22 S.Ct. 857, 46 L.Ed. 1113. The Court in Moyses held that the Bankruptcy Clause's uniformity principle does not require Congress to eliminate existing state exemptions in bankruptcy laws. Id., at 188, 22 S.Ct. 857. The Court explained that the general operation of the law is uniform although it may result in certain particulars differently in different States. Id., at 190, 22 S.Ct. 857.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,58,"Next, in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974), the Court affirmed the constitutionality of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, which applied only to rail carriers operating within a defined region of the country, where no railroad reorganization  was pending outside that defined region. Id., at 159-160, 95 S.Ct. 335. The Court described the flexibility inherent in the Bankruptcy Clause, id., at 158, 95 S.Ct. 335, which does not deny Congress power  to take into account differences that exist between different parts of the country, and to fashion legislation to resolve geographically isolated problems, id., at 159, 95 S.Ct. 335. Because the Regional Rail Reorganization Act operated uniformly upon all bankrupt railroads then operating in the United States, it was consistent with the Bankruptcy Act's uniformity principle. Id., at 160, 95 S.Ct. 335. Put simply, Congress may enact geographically limited bankruptcy laws consistent with the uniformity requirement if it is responding to a geographically limited problem.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,59,"While the uniformity requirement allows Congress to account for differences that exist between different parts of the country, id., at 159, 95 S.Ct. 335, it does not give Congress free rein to subject similarly situated debtors in different States to different fees because it chooses to pay the costs for some, but not others. In Gibbons, 455 U.S. 457, 102 S.Ct. 1169, 71 L.Ed.2d 335, the Court struck down the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act (RITA), in which Congress altered the order of priority of claimants in a single railroad's bankruptcy proceedings. The Court recognized that the Bankruptcy Clause contains an affirmative limitation or restriction upon Congress' power, namely, the uniformity requirement. Id., at 468, 102 S.Ct. 1169. RITA exceeded this limitation, the Court explained, because it singled out one railroad and did not apply to other similarly situated railroads that were engaged in bankruptcy proceedings. Id., at 470, 102 S.Ct. 1169. The Court reasoned that unlike the Regional Rail Reorganization Act, RITA was not a response either to the particular problems of major railroad bankruptcies or to any geographically isolated problem: it is a response to the problems caused by the bankruptcy of one railroad. Ibid. For that reason, RITA cannot be said to apply uniformly even to major railroads in bankruptcy proceedings throughout the United States. Id., at 471, 102 S.Ct. 1169. The Court emphasized that its holding  does not impair Congress' ability under the Bankruptcy Clause to define classes of debtors and to structure relief accordingly and summarized that to survive scrutiny under the Bankruptcy Clause, a law must at least apply uniformly to a defined class of debtors. Id., at 473, 102 S.Ct. 1169.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,60,"In sum, our precedent provides that the Bankruptcy Clause offers Congress flexibility, but does not permit the arbitrary, disparate treatment of similarly situated debtors based on geography.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,62,"Here, there is no dispute that the 2017 Act's fee increase was not geographically uniform. The only remaining question is whether Congress permissibly imposed nonuniform fees because it was responding to a funding deficit limited to the Trustee Program districts. Under the specific circumstances present here, the nonuniform fee increase violated the uniformity requirement.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,63,"All agree that the fee increase applied differently to Chapter 11 debtors in different regions. Debtors in Alabama and North Carolina, unlike debtors in the remainder of the country, paid no fee increases for the first three quarters of 2018. Moreover, the fee increase only applied to newly filed cases, and not pending cases, in those two States. That geographical disparity meant that petitioner paid over $500,000 more in fees compared to an identical debtor in North Carolina or Alabama.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,64,"Recognizing that the 2017 Act caused such disparities, respondent contends that those disparities were a permissible effort to solve a particular geographical problem: the budgetary shortfall that befell  the UST Fund, which supports the Trustee Program but not the Administrator Program. Respondent argues that this problem justified Congress' imposition of fee increases specific to Trustee Program districts in order to replenish the UST Fund's coffers. It is true that Congress' stated goal in raising fees in Trustee Program districts was to address this budgetary shortfall. That shortfall, however, existed only because Congress itself had arbitrarily separated the districts into two different systems with different cost funding mechanisms, requiring Trustee Program districts to fund the Program through user fees while enabling Administrator Program districts to draw on taxpayer funds by way of the Judiciary's general budget.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,65,"The problem Congress sought to address here is thus different from the problem facing the debtors in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases. There, a national rail transportation crisis prompted Congress to respond with the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. 419 U.S. at 159, 95 S.Ct. 335. That crisis arose when eight major railroads located in the Northeast and the Midwest entered reorganization proceedings. Id., at 108, 95 S.Ct. 335. Congress responded accordingly with legislation tailored to those regions. Id., at 108-109, 95 S.Ct. 335. The problems prompting Congress' disparate treatment in this case, however, stem not from an external and geographically isolated need, but from Congress' own decision to create a dual bankruptcy system funded through different mechanisms in which only districts in two States could opt into the more favorable fee system for debtors.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,66,"The Bankruptcy Clause affords Congress flexibility to fashion legislation to resolve geographically isolated problems, id., at 159, 95 S.Ct. 335, but as precedent instructs, the Clause does not permit Congress to treat identical debtors differently based on an artificial funding distinction that Congress itself created. The Clause, after all, would clearly prohibit Congress from arbitrarily dividing States into two categories and charging different fees to States in different categories unrelated to the needs of, or conditions in, those States. The Clause does not allow Congress to accomplish in two steps what it forbids in one.2",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,67,"A few observations on the limits of this decision are in order. The Court does not today address the constitutionality of the dual scheme of the bankruptcy system itself, only Congress' decision to impose different fee arrangements in those two systems. The Court's holding today also should not be understood to impair Congress' authority to structure relief differently for different classes of debtors or to respond to geographically isolated problems. The Court holds only that the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause prohibits Congress from arbitrarily burdening only one set of debtors with a more onerous funding mechanism than  that which applies to debtors in other States.",Sotomayor,0,
2021-064,69,"The parties dispute the appropriate remedy. Petitioner seeks a full refund of fees that it paid during the nonuniform period. Respondent argues that any remedy should apply only prospectively, or should result in a fee increase for debtors who paid less in the Administrator Program districts. The parties raise a host of legal and administrative concerns with each of the remedies proposed, including the practicality, feasibility, and equities of each proposal, their costs, and potential waivers by nonobjecting debtors. The court below, however, has not yet had an opportunity to address these issues or their relevancy to the proper remedy. Mindful that we are a court of review, not of first view, Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005), this Court remands for the Fourth Circuit to consider these questions in the first instance.* * *",Sotomayor,0,

Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based on the allegedly improper admission of an un-Mirandized1 statement in a criminal prosecution. The case arose out of the interrogation of respondent, Terence Tekoh, by petitioner, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Carlos Vega. Deputy Vega questioned Tekoh at his place of employment and did not give him a Miranda warning. Tekoh was prosecuted, and his confession was admitted into evidence, but the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Tekoh then sued Vega under § 1983, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the use of Tekoh's un-Mirandized statement provided a valid basis for a § 1983 claim against Vega. We now reject this extension of our Miranda case law.",Alito,0,
2021-066,29,"In March 2014, Tekoh was working as a certified nursing assistant at a Los Angeles medical center. When a female patient accused him of sexually assaulting her, the hospital staff reported the accusation to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and Deputy Vega responded. Vega questioned Tekoh at length in the hospital, and Tekoh eventually provided a written statement apologizing for inappropriately touching the patient's genitals. The parties dispute whether Vega used coercive investigatory techniques to extract the statement, but it is undisputed that he never informed Tekoh of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), which held that during a custodial interrogation police officers must inform a suspect that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he  says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning.

At Tekoh's first trial, the judge held that Miranda had not been violated because Tekoh was not in custody when he provided the statement, but the trial resulted in a mistrial. When Tekoh was retried, a second judge again denied his request to exclude the confession. This trial resulted in acquittal, and Tekoh then brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Vega and several other defendants seeking damages for alleged violations of his constitutional rights, including his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.",Alito,0,
2021-066,31,"When this § 1983 case was first tried, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Vega, but the judge concluded that he had given an improper jury instruction and thus granted a new trial. Before the second trial, Tekoh asked the court to instruct the jury that it was required to find that Vega violated the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination if it determined that he took a statement from Tekoh in violation of Miranda and that the statement was then improperly used against Tekoh at his criminal trial. The District Court declined, reasoning that Miranda established a prophylactic rule and that such a rule could not alone provide a ground for § 1983 liability. Instead, the jury was asked to decide whether Tekoh's Fifth Amendment right had been violated. The court instructed the jury to determine, based on the totality of all the surrounding circumstances, whether Tekoh's statement had been improperly coerced or compelled, and the court explained that a confession is improperly coerced or compelled  if a police officer uses physical or psychological force or threats not permitted by law to undermine a person's ability to exercise his or her free will.

Tekoh v. County of Los Angeles, 985 F.3d 713, 722 (2021). The panel acknowledged that this Court has repeatedly said that Miranda adopted prophylactic rules designed to protect against constitutional violations and that the decision did not hold that the contravention of those rules necessarily constitutes a constitutional violation. See 985 F.3d at 719-720. But the panel thought that our decision in Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000), made clear that the right of a criminal defendant against having an un-Mirandized statement introduced in the prosecution's case in chief is indeed a right secured by the Constitution. 985 F.3d at 720. Therefore the panel concluded that Tekoh could establish a violation of his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination simply by showing that Miranda had been violated.

This Clause permits a person to refuse to testify against himself at a criminal trial in which he is a defendant and also `privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.'

In addition, the right bars the introduction against a criminal defendant of out-of-court statements obtained by compulsion. See, e.g., Bram v.

2021-066,39,"In this case, the Ninth Circuit held—and Tekoh now argues, Brief for Respondent 20—that a violation of Miranda constitutes a violation of the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, but that is wrong. Miranda itself and our subsequent cases make clear that Miranda imposed a set of prophylactic rules. Those rules, to be sure, are constitutionally based, Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 440, 120 S.Ct. 2326, but they are prophylactic rules nonetheless.",Alito,0,
2021-066,41,"Miranda itself was clear on this point. Miranda did not hold that a violation of the rules it established necessarily constitute a Fifth Amendment violation, and it is difficult to see how it could have held otherwise. For one thing, it is easy to imagine many situations in which an un-Mirandized suspect in custody may make self-incriminating statements without any hint of compulsion. In addition, the warnings that the Court required included components, such as notification of the right to have retained or appointed counsel present during questioning, that do not concern self-incrimination per se but are instead plainly designed to safeguard that right.

See id., at 439, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (describing its rules as procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment), id., at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (describing rules as procedural safeguards), id., at 457, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (appropriate safeguards), id., at 458, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (adequate protective devices), id., at 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (safeguards).",Alito,0,
2021-066,43,"In accordance with this understanding of the nature of the rules it imposed, the Miranda Court stated quite clearly that the Constitution did not itself require adherence to any particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process and that its decision in no way created a constitutional straitjacket. Ibid. The opinion added that its new rules might not be needed if Congress or the States adopted other procedures which are at least as effective, ibid., and the opinion suggested that there might not have been any actual Fifth Amendment violations in the four cases that were before the Court. See id., at 457, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (In these cases, we might not find the defendants' statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms). The Court could not have said any of these things if a violation of the Miranda rules necessarily constituted a violation of the Fifth Amendment.",Alito,0,

2021-066,45,"After Miranda was handed down, the Court engaged in the process of charting the dimensions of these new prophylactic rules. As we would later spell out, this process entailed a weighing of the benefits and costs of any clarification of the rules' scope. See Shatzer, 559 U.S. at 106, 130 S.Ct. 1213 (A judicially crafted rule is `justified only by reference to its prophylactic purpose,'  and applies only where its benefits outweigh its costs).",Alito,0,
2021-066,46,"Some post-Miranda decisions found that the balance of interests justified restrictions that would not have been possible if Miranda represented an explanation of the meaning of the Fifth Amendment right as opposed to a set of rules designed to protect that right. For example, in Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 224-226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), the Court held that a statement obtained in violation of Miranda could be used to impeach the testimony of a defendant, even though an involuntary statement obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment could not have been employed in this way. See Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 398, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978) (Any criminal trial use against a defendant of his involuntary statement is a denial of due process of law (emphasis deleted)). Engaging in the process we described in Shatzer, the Harris Court considered the benefits of forbidding impeachment but dismissed the speculative possibility that this would discourage impermissible police conduct, and on the other side of the scale, it feared that barring impeachment would turn Miranda into a license to use perjury by way of a defense. 401 U.S. at 225-226, 91 S.Ct. 643.",Alito,0,
2021-066,47,"A similar analysis was used in Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 450-452, n. 26, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974), where the Court held that the fruits of an un-Mirandized statement can be admitted. The Court noted that the `fruits' of police conduct which actually infringes a defendant's constitutional rights must be suppressed. Id., at 445, 94 S.Ct. 2357, see also Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963) (applying the rule in the context of a Fourth Amendment violation). But the Court distinguished police conduct that abridges a person's constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination from conduct that departs only from the prophylactic standards later laid down by this Court in Miranda to safeguard that privilege. 417 U.S. at 445-446, 94 S.Ct. 2357. Because there had been only a Miranda violation in that case, the Wong Sun rule of automatic exclusion was found to be inapplicable. See 417 U.S. at 445-446, 94 S.Ct. 2357. Instead, the Court asked whether the Miranda rules' prophylactic purposes justified the exclusion of the fruits of the violation, and after balancing the interests involved, it held that exclusion was not required. 417 U.S. at 447-452, 94 S.Ct. 2357.",Alito,0,
2021-066,48,"In New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 654-657, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), the Court held that statements obtained in violation of Miranda need not be suppressed when the questioning is conducted to address an ongoing public safety concern. The Court reasoned that Miranda warnings are `not themselves rights protected by the Constitution' and that the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighed the need for the prophylactic rule. 467 U.S. at 654, 657, 104 S.Ct. 2626.",Alito,0,
2021-066,49,"Finally, in Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222, the Court again distinguished between a constitutional violation and a violation of Miranda. In that case, a suspect in custody was initially questioned without receiving a Miranda warning, and the statements made at that time were suppressed. 470 U.S. at 301-302, 105 S.Ct. 1285. But the suspect was later given Miranda warnings, chose to waive his Miranda rights, and signed a written confession. 470 U.S. at 301, 105 S.Ct. 1285. Asked to decide whether this confession was admissible, the Court followed the reasoning in Tucker and again held that the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree rule that applies to constitutional violations does not apply to violations of Miranda. 470 U.S. at 306-309, 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285. The Court refused to exclude the signed confession and emphasized that an officer's error in administering the prophylactic Miranda procedures  should not breed the same irremediable consequences as police infringement of the Fifth Amendment itself.3 Id., at 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285.",Alito,0,
2021-066,50,It is hard to see how these decisions could stand if a violation of Miranda constituted a violation of the Fifth Amendment.,Alito,0,
2021-066,52,"While these decisions imposed limits on Miranda's prophylactic rules, other decisions found that the balance of interests called for expansion. In Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 617-619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), the Court held that silence following a Miranda warning cannot be used to impeach. The Court acknowledged that Miranda warnings are prophylactic, 426 U.S. at 617, 96 S.Ct. 2240, and it recognized the prosecution's need to test a defendant's exculpatory story through cross-examination, id., at 616-618, 96 S.Ct. 2240. But it found that allowing the use of post-warning silence would undermine the warnings' implicit promise that silence would not be used to convict. Id., at 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240.",Alito,0,
2021-066,53,"Similarly, in Roberson, 486 U.S. at 682, 108 S.Ct. 2093, the Court held that a suspect's post-warning request for counsel with respect to one offense barred later interrogation without counsel regarding a different offense. Describing the Miranda rules as prophylactic protections, 486 U.S. at 681, 108 S.Ct. 2093, the Court concluded that both law enforcement and criminal defendants would benefit from a bright-line, id., at 681-682, 108 S.Ct. 2093.",Alito,0,
2021-066,54,"Finally, in Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407, the Court rejected an attempt to restrict Miranda's application in collateral proceedings based on the reasoning in Stone  v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). In Stone, the Court had held that a defendant who has had a full and fair opportunity to seek suppression of evidence allegedly seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment may not obtain federal habeas relief on that ground, id., at 494-495, 96 S.Ct. 3037, and in Withrow, a state prison warden argued that a similar rule should apply to a habeas petitioner who had been given an opportunity to litigate a Miranda claim at trial, see 507 U.S. at 688-690, 113 S.Ct. 1745. Once again acknowledging that Miranda adopted prophylactic rules, the Court balanced the competing interests and found that the costs of adopting the warden's argument outweighed any benefits. On the cost side, the Court noted that enforcing Miranda safeguards `a fundamental trial right and furthers the correct ascertainment of guilt at trial. 507 U.S. at 691-692, 113 S.Ct. 1745. And on the other side, the Court found that the adoption of a Stone-like rule would not significantly benefit the federal courts in their exercise of habeas jurisdiction, or advance the cause of federalism in any substantial way. 507 U.S. at 693, 113 S.Ct. 1745.",Alito,0,
2021-066,55,"Thus, all the post-Miranda cases we have discussed acknowledged the prophylactic nature of the Miranda rules and engaged in cost-benefit analysis to define the scope of these prophylactic rules.",Alito,0,
2021-066,57,"Contrary to the decision below and Tekoh's argument here, see Brief for Respondent 24, our decision in Dickerson, 530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405, did not upset the firmly established prior understanding of Miranda as a prophylactic decision. Dickerson involved a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3501, that effectively overruled Miranda by making the admissibility of a statement given during custodial interrogation turn solely on whether it was made voluntarily. 530 U.S. at 431-432, 120 S.Ct. 2326. The Court held that Congress could not abrogate Miranda by statute because Miranda was a constitutional decision that adopted a constitutional rule, 530 U.S. at 438-439, 120 S.Ct. 2326, and the Court noted that these rules could not have been made applicable to the States if it did not have that status, see ibid.",Alito,0,
2021-066,58,"At the same time, however, the Court made it clear that it was not equating a violation of the Miranda rules with an outright Fifth Amendment violation. For one thing, it reiterated Miranda's observation that the Constitution would not preclude legislative solutions that differed from the prescribed Miranda warnings but which were `at least as effective in apprising accused persons' of their rights. 530 U.S. at 440, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602).",Alito,0,
2021-066,59,"Even more to the point, the Court rejected the dissent's argument that § 3501 could not be held unconstitutional unless Miranda warnings are required by the Constitution, in the sense that nothing else will suffice to satisfy constitutional requirements. 530 U.S. at 442, 120 S.Ct. 2326. The Court's answer, in substance, was that the Miranda rules, though not an explication of the meaning of the Fifth Amendment right, are rules that are necessary to protect that right (at least until a better alternative is found and adopted). See 530 U.S. at 441-443, 120 S.Ct. 2326. Thus, in the words of the Dickerson Court, the Miranda rules are constitutionally based and have constitutional underpinnings. 530 U.S. at 440, and n. 5, 120 S.Ct. 2326. But the obvious point of these formulations was to avoid saying that a Miranda violation is the same as a violation of the Fifth Amendment right.",Alito,0,
2021-066,60,"What all this boils down to is basically as follows. The Miranda rules are prophylactic rules that the Court found to be necessary to protect the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. In that sense, Miranda was a constitutional decision and it adopted a constitutional rule because the decision was based on the Court's judgment about what is required to safeguard that constitutional right. And when the Court adopts a constitutional prophylactic rule of this nature, Dickerson concluded, the rule has the status of a Law of the United States that is binding on the States under the Supremacy Clause4 (as Miranda implicitly held, since three of the four decisions it reversed came from state court, 384 U.S. at 491-494, 497-499, 86 S.Ct. 1602), and the rule cannot be altered by ordinary legislation.",Alito,0,
2021-066,61,"This was a bold and controversial claim of authority,5 but we do not think that Dickerson can be understood any other way without (1) taking the insupportable position that a Miranda violation is tantamount to a violation of the Fifth Amendment, (2) calling into question the prior decisions that were predicated on the proposition that a Miranda violation is not the same as a constitutional violation, and (3) excising from the United States Reports a mountain of statements describing the Miranda rules as prophylactic.",Alito,0,
2021-066,62,"Subsequent cases confirm that Dickerson did not upend the Court's understanding of the Miranda rules as prophylactic. See, e.g., supra, at 2102-2103 (collecting post-Dickerson cases).",Alito,0,
2021-066,63,"In sum, a violation of Miranda does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Constitution, and therefore such a violation does not constitute the deprivation of a right  secured by the Constitution. 42 U.S.C. § 1983.",Alito,0,
2021-066,65,"This conclusion does not necessarily dictate reversal because a § 1983 claim may also be based on the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the  laws. (Emphasis added.) It may thus be argued that the Miranda rules constitute federal law and that an abridgment of those rules can therefore provide the ground for a § 1983 claim. But whatever else may be said about this argument,6 it cannot succeed  unless Tekoh can persuade us that this law should be expanded to include the right to sue for damages under § 1983.",Alito,0,
2021-066,66,"As we have noted, a judicially crafted prophylactic rule should apply only where its benefits outweigh its costs, Shatzer, 559 U.S. at 106, 130 S.Ct. 1213, and here, while the benefits of permitting the assertion of Miranda claims under § 1983 would be slight, the costs would be substantial.",Alito,0,
2021-066,67,"Miranda rests on a pragmatic judgment about what is needed to stop the violation at trial of the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. That prophylactic purpose is served by the suppression at trial of statements obtained in violation of Miranda and by the application of that decision in other recognized contexts. Allowing the victim of a Miranda violation to sue a police officer for damages under § 1983 would have little additional deterrent value, and permitting such claims would cause many problems.",Alito,0,
2021-066,68,"Allowing a claim like Tekoh's would disserve judicial economy, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979), by requiring a federal judge or jury to adjudicate a factual question (whether Tekoh was in custody when questioned) that had already been decided by a state court. This re-adjudication would not only be wasteful, it would undercut the `strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions' based on the same set of facts. Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 484, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). And it could produce unnecessary friction between the federal and state court systems by requiring the federal court entertaining the § 1983 claim to pass judgment on legal and factual issues already settled in state court. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 490-491, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).",Alito,0,
2021-066,69,"Allowing § 1983 suits based on Miranda claims could also present many procedural issues, such as whether a federal court considering a § 1983 claim would owe any deference to a trial court's factual findings, whether forfeiture and plain error rules carry over from the criminal trial, whether harmless-error rules apply, and whether civil damages are available in instances where the unwarned statement had no impact on the outcome of the criminal case.",Alito,0,
2021-066,70,"We therefore refuse to extend Miranda in the way Tekoh requests. Miranda, Dickerson, and the other cases in that line provide sufficient protection for the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. The identification of a Miranda violation and its consequences ought to be determined at trial. Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 790, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). And except in unusual circumstances, the exclusion of unwarned  statements should be a complete and sufficient remedy. Ibid.* * *",Alito,0,
2021-066,71,"Because a violation of Miranda is not itself a violation of the Fifth Amendment, and because we see no justification for expanding Miranda to confer a right to sue under § 1983, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",Alito,0,

2021-066,74,"The Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), affords well-known protections to suspects who are interrogated by police while in custody. Those protections derive from the Constitution: Dickerson v. United States tells us in no uncertain terms that Miranda is a constitutional rule. 530 U.S. 428, 444, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). And that rule grants a corresponding right: If police fail to provide the Miranda warnings to a suspect before interrogating him, then he is generally entitled to have any resulting confession excluded from his trial. See 384 U.S. at 478-479, 86 S.Ct. 1602. From those facts, only one conclusion can follow—that Miranda's protections are a right secured by the Constitution under the federal civil rights statute. Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Yet the Court today says otherwise. It holds that Miranda is not a constitutional right enforceable through a § 1983 suit. And so it prevents individuals from obtaining any redress when police violate their rights under Miranda. I respectfully dissent.",Kagan,0,
2021-066,75,"Miranda responded to problems stemming from the interrogation of suspects incommunicado and in a police-dominated atmosphere. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 445, 86 S.Ct. 1602. In such an environment, Miranda said, there are pressures which may compel a suspect to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely. Id., at 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602. And so Miranda found a necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his Fifth Amendment privilege not to be compelled to incriminate himself. Id., at 439, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Miranda set out protocols (including the now-familiar warnings) that would safeguard the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. See id., at 478-479, 86 S.Ct. 1602. And Miranda held that if police failed to follow those requirements (without substituting equally effective ones), the prosecution could not use at trial a statement obtained from the interrogation. See id., at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602.",Kagan,0,
2021-066,76,"The question in this case is whether Miranda's protections are a right that is secured by the Constitution within the meaning of § 1983. If the answer is yes, then a person may sue a state actor who deprives him of the right. In past cases, the Court has given a broad construction to § 1983's broad language. See, e.g., Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 443, 111 S.Ct. 865, 112 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991). Under § 1983 (as elsewhere), a right is anything that creates specific obligations binding on a governmental unit that an individual may ask the judiciary to enforce. Id., at 449, 111 S.Ct. 865, see id., at 447, 111 S.Ct. 865, and n. 7. And the phrase secured by the Constitution also has a capacious meaning. It refers to any right that is protected or made certain by the country's foundational charter. Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496, 527, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Kagan,0,
2021-066,77,"Begin with whether Miranda is secured by the Constitution. We know that it is, because the Court's decision in Dickerson says so. Dickerson tells us again and again that Miranda is a constitutional rule. 530 U.S. at 444, 120 S.Ct. 2326. It is a constitutional decision that sets forth `concrete constitutional guidelines.' Id., at 432, 435, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 442, 86 S.Ct. 1602). Miranda is constitutionally based, or again, it has a constitutional basis. 530 U.S. at 439, n. 3, 440, 120 S.Ct. 2326. It is of constitutional origin, it has constitutional underpinnings. Id., at 439, n. 3, 440, n. 5, 120 S.Ct. 2326. And—one more— Miranda sets a constitutional minimum. 530 U.S. at 442, 120 S.Ct. 2326. Over and over, Dickerson labels Miranda a rule stemming from the Constitution.",Kagan,0,
2021-066,78,"Dickerson also makes plain that Miranda has all the substance of a constitutional rule—including that it cannot be abrogated by any legislation. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 491, 86 S.Ct. 1602, see Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 437, 120 S.Ct. 2326. In Dickerson, the Court considered a federal statute whose obvious purpose was to override Miranda. Dickerson held that Miranda is a constitutional decision that cannot be overruled by any Act of Congress. 530 U.S. at 432, 120 S.Ct. 2326. To be sure, Congress may devise legislative solutions that differ from the prescribed Miranda warnings, but only if those solutions are `at least as effective.' Id., at 440, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602). Dickerson therefore instructs (as noted above) that Miranda sets a constitutional minimum. 530 U.S. at 442, 120 S.Ct. 2326. No statute may provide lesser protection than that baseline.*",Kagan,0,
2021-066,79,"And Dickerson makes clear that the constitutional substance of Miranda does not end there. Rules arising from the United States Constitution are applicable in state-court proceedings, but non-constitutional rules are not. See 530 U.S. at 438, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (explaining that the Court does not hold a supervisory power over the courts of the several States). Too, constitutional rules are enforceable in federal-court habeas proceedings, where a prisoner is entitled to claim he is in custody in violation of the Constitution. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). Miranda checks both boxes. The Court has consistently applied Miranda's rule to prosecutions arising in state courts. Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 438, 120 S.Ct. 2326. And prisoners may claim Miranda violations in federal-court habeas proceedings. See 530 U.S. at 439, n. 3, 120 S.Ct. 2326, Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 107, n. 5, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995). So Dickerson is unequivocal: Miranda is set in constitutional stone.",Kagan,0,
2021-066,80,"Miranda's constitutional rule gives suspects a correlative right. § 1983. Under Miranda, a suspect typically has a right to be tried without the prosecutor using his un-Mirandized statement. And we know how that right operates in the real world. Suppose a defendant standing trial was able to show the court that he  gave an un-Mirandized confession during a custodial interrogation. The court would have no choice but to exclude it from the prosecutor's case. As one judge below put it: Miranda indisputably creates individual legal rights that are judicially enforceable. (Any prosecutor who doubts this can try to introduce an un-Mirandized confession and then watch what happens.) Tekoh v. County of Los Angeles, 997 F.3d 1260, 1263 (C.A.9 2021) (Miller, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).",Kagan,0,
2021-066,81,"The majority basically agrees with everything I've just explained. It concurs that, per Dickerson, Miranda adopted a `constitutional rule.' Ante, at 2105 (quoting Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 439, 120 S.Ct. 2326), see ante, at 2105-2106. How could it not? That Miranda is a constitutional rule is what Dickerson said (and said and said). The majority also agrees that Miranda directed that statements obtained in violation of its rules may not be used by the prosecution in its case-in-chief— which is simply another way of saying that Miranda grants suspects a right to the exclusion of those statements from the prosecutor's case. Ante, at 2101.",Kagan,0,
2021-066,82,"So how does the majority hold that a violation of Miranda is not a deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution? § 1983. How does it agree with my premises, but not my conclusion? The majority's argument is that a violation of Miranda does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Constitution, because Miranda's rules are prophylactic. Ante, at 2106. The idea is that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the use only of statements obtained by compulsion, whereas Miranda excludes non-compelled statements too. See ante, at 2100-2102. That is why, the majority says, the Court has been able to recognize exceptions permitting certain uses of un-Mirandized statements at trial (when it could not do so for compelled statements). See ante, at 2102-2104.",Kagan,0,
2021-066,83,"But none of that helps the majority's case. Let's assume, as the majority says, that Miranda extends beyond—in order to safeguard—the Fifth Amendment's core guarantee. Still, Miranda is enforceable through § 1983. It remains a constitutional rule, as Dickerson held (and the majority agrees). And it grants the defendant a legally enforceable entitlement—in a word, a right—to have his confession excluded. So, to refer back to the language of § 1983, Miranda grants a right secured by the Constitution. Whether that right to have evidence excluded safeguards a yet deeper constitutional commitment makes no difference to § 1983. The majority has no response to that point—except to repeat what our argument assumes already. See ante, at 2106, n. 6 (describing Miranda as prophylactic).",Kagan,0,
2021-066,84,"Compare the majority's holding today to a prior decision, in which the Court rejected an attempt to limit the types of constitutional rights that are encompassed within § 1983. Dennis, 498 U.S. at 445, 111 S.Ct. 865. There, the Court held that a plaintiff could sue under § 1983 for a violation of the so-called dormant Commerce Clause, which safeguards interstate commerce. To the Court, it did not matter that the Commerce Clause might be viewed as merely allocating power between the Federal and State Governments over interstate commerce, rather than as conferring `rights.' Id., at 447, 111 S.Ct. 865. Nor did it matter that the dormant Commerce Clause's protection is only implied by the constitutional text. Ibid., n. 7. The dormant Commerce Clause, the Court said, still provides a right—in the ordinary sense of being `a legally enforceable claim of one person against another.' Ibid. (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1324 (6th ed. 1990)). That describes Miranda to  a tee. And if a right implied from Congress's constitutional authority over interstate commerce is enforceable under § 1983, how could it be that Miranda— which the Court has found necessary to safeguard the personal protections of the Fifth Amendment—is not also enforceable? The majority again has no answer.* * *",Kagan,0,
2021-066,85,"Today, the Court strips individuals of the ability to seek a remedy for violations of the right recognized in Miranda. The majority observes that defendants may still seek the suppression at trial of statements obtained in violation of Miranda's procedures. Ante, at 2106-2107. But sometimes, such a statement will not be suppressed. And sometimes, as a result, a defendant will be wrongly convicted and spend years in prison. He may succeed, on appeal or in habeas, in getting the conviction reversed. But then, what remedy does he have for all the harm he has suffered? The point of § 1983 is to provide such redress—because a remedy is a vital component of any scheme for vindicating cherished constitutional guarantees. Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 639, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980). The majority here, as elsewhere, injures the right by denying the remedy. See, e.g., Egbert v. Boule, 596 U.

2021-067,28,"On the evening of September 23, 1992, Raymond Twyford and his co-conspirator lured Richard Franks to a remote location, and shot and killed him. To hide their crime, the pair mutilated Franks's body and pushed it into a pond. But a sheriff found the body a few days later, and his investigation led to Twyford. Twyford confessed, claiming that Franks had raped his girlfriend's daughter and that he had killed Franks out of revenge. A jury convicted Twyford of aggravated murder, kidnapping, robbery, and other charges, and he was sentenced to death. The Ohio appellate courts affirmed his conviction and sentence, State v. Twyford, 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 763 N.E.2d 122, and this Court denied certiorari, 537 U.S. 917, 123 S.Ct. 302, 154 L.Ed.2d 203 (2002).",Roberts,0,

Relevant here, he claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence of a head injury Twyford sustained as a teenager during a suicide attempt. That injury, Twyford argued, left him unable to make rational and voluntary choices. State v. Twyford, 2001 WL 301411, *10 (Ohio App. 7th, Mar. 19, 2001). The Ohio trial court and Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits, concluding that a finding of ineffective assistance cannot be based upon the trial counsel's choice of one competing psychological explanation over another. Id., at *13. The Court of Appeals noted that Twyford's counsel had called a psychologist who testified in support of a completely different theory: that Twyford's commission of the murder was his way of protecting the alleged rape victim from the same type of abusive behavior he had experienced when he was young. Ibid. Unlike the head injury theory, this one explained Twyford's seemingly deliberate and rational actions: planning a fake hunting trip as a ruse to lure Franks to a remote location, dismembering his body, and disposing of it in such a way as would conceal his identity. This theory was also consistent with Twyford's own written confession, which described his plan in detail. The Ohio Supreme Court denied review. State v.

The State moved in 2008 to dismiss many of Twyford's claims on the ground that he failed to raise them in state court. The District Court did not rule on that motion for nine years. Eventually, it dismissed most of Twyford's claims as procedurally  defaulted but allowed a few, including some ineffective assistance of counsel claims, to proceed. Twyford v.

Motion to Transport for Medical Testing in No. 2:03-cv-906 (SD Ohio), p. 1 (Motion to Transport). Twyford explained that such testing could not be conducted at the prison, and argued that it was necessary to determine whether he suffers neurological defects due to childhood physical abuse, alcohol and drug use, and the self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. Id., at 3. In support of his motion, he attached a letter from a neurologist stating that a CT/FDG-PET scan would be a useful next step to further evaluate him for brain injury, in part because previous scans revealed 20 to 30 metal fragments in his skull. App. to Pet. for Cert. 272a. Twyford argued that it was plausible that the testing was likely to reveal evidence in support of claims and that it could plausibly lead to the development of evidence and materials that could counter arguments of procedural default or exhaustion.

2021-067,39,"A federal court's power to grant habeas relief is restricted under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which provides that the writ may issue only on the ground that the prisoner is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). To understand the propriety of the transportation order the District Court entered while adjudicating Twyford's habeas corpus action, it is necessary to review the limits AEDPA imposes on federal courts.",Roberts,0,
2021-067,40,"Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases, Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003), and to advance the principles of comity, finality, and federalism, Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (Michael Williams). It furthered those goals in large measure by revising the standards used for evaluating the merits of a habeas application. Garceau, 538 U.S. at 206, 123 S.Ct. 1398. Pertinent here, § 2254(d) provides that if a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, a federal court cannot grant relief unless the state court (1) contradicted or unreasonably applied this Court's precedents, or (2) handed down a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. The question under AEDPA is thus not whether a federal court believes the state court's determination was incorrect, but whether that determination was unreasonable—a substantially higher threshold for a prisoner to meet. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007), see also Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102-103, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).",Roberts,0,
2021-067,41,"AEDPA also restricts the ability of a federal habeas court to develop and consider new evidence. Review of factual determinations under § 2254(d)(2) is expressly limited to the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. And in  Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011), we explained that review of legal claims under § 2254(d)(1) is also limited to the record that was before the state court. Id., at 181, 131 S.Ct. 1388. This ensures that the state trial on the merits is the main event, so to speak, rather than a tryout on the road for what will later be the determinative federal habeas hearing. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).",Roberts,0,
2021-067,42,"If a prisoner failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, a federal court may admit new evidence, but only in two quite limited situations. § 2254(e)(2). Either the claim must rely on a new and previously unavailable rule of constitutional law made retroactively applicable by this Court, or it must rely on a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence. § 2254(e)(2)(A). And even if a prisoner can satisfy one of those two exceptions, he must also show that the desired evidence would demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that no reasonable factfinder would have convicted him of the charged crime. § 2254(e)(2)(B). Thus, although state prisoners may occasionally submit new evidence in federal court, AEDPA's statutory scheme is designed to strongly discourage them from doing so. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 186, 131 S.Ct. 1388, see also Michael Williams, 529 U.S. at 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479 (Federal courts sitting in habeas are not an alternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufficient effort to pursue in state proceedings.).",Roberts,0,
2021-067,43,"We have explained that a federal court, in deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing or otherwise consider new evidence under § 2254(e)(2), must first take into account these restrictions. Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, 596 U. S. ___, ___ 142 S.Ct. 1718, 1739, L.Ed.2d (2022), see also Schriro, 550 U.S. at 474, 127 S.Ct. 1933. The reasons for this are familiar. A federal court may never needlessly prolong a habeas case, particularly given the essential need to promote the finality of state convictions, so a court must, before facilitating the development of new evidence, determine that it could be legally considered in the prisoner's case. Shinn, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1739 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), see also Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997) (A habeas petitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in federal court, is not entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary course.). If § 2254(e)(2) applies and the prisoner cannot satisfy its stringent requirements, Michael Williams, 529 U.S. at 433, 120 S.Ct. 1479, holding an evidentiary hearing or otherwise expanding the state-court record would prolong federal habeas proceedings with no purpose, Shinn, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1739 (internal quotation marks omitted). And that would in turn disturb the State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation. Harrington, 562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770. A court therefore must, consistent with AEDPA, determine at the outset whether the new evidence sought could be lawfully considered.",Roberts,0,
2021-067,44,"This is true even when the All Writs Act is the asserted vehicle for gathering new evidence. We have made clear that a petitioner cannot use that Act to circumvent statutory requirements or otherwise binding procedural rules. See Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985) (Although the Act empowers federal courts  to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.), Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U.S. 28, 32-33, 123 S.Ct. 366, 154 L.Ed.2d 368 (2002) (same). AEDPA provides the governing rules for federal habeas proceedings, and our precedents explain that a district court must consider that statute's requirements before facilitating the development of new evidence. See Schriro, 550 U.S. at 474, 127 S.Ct. 1933, see also Shinn, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1739.",Roberts,0,
2021-067,45,"By the same token, a writ seeking new evidence would not be necessary or appropriate in aid of a federal habeas court's jurisdiction, as all orders issued under the All Writs Act must be, if it enables a prisoner to fish for unusable evidence, in the hope that it might undermine his conviction in some way. In every habeas case, the court must be guided by the general principles underlying our habeas corpus jurisprudence. Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 554, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998). A writ that enables a prisoner to gather evidence that would not be admissible would needlessly prolong resolution of the federal habeas case, Shinn, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 1739, and frustrate the State's interest in finality, Calderon, 523 U.S. at 556, 118 S.Ct. 1489. Cf. Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 300, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969) (recognizing, before AEDPA, that a writ is necessary or appropriate in aid of a federal habeas court's jurisdiction if specific allegations show that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief).",Roberts,0,
2021-067,46,"A federal court order requiring a State to transport a prisoner to a public setting —here, a medical center for testing— not only delays resolution of his habeas case, but may also present serious risks to public safety.

Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948) (a court should not require that a prisoner be transported if doing so would cause undue inconvenience or danger).2 Commanding a State to take these risks so that a prisoner can search for unusable evidence would not be a necessary or appropriate means of aiding a federal court's limited habeas review.",Roberts,0,
2021-067,48,"The District Court entered an order directing the State to transport Twyford to a medical facility, concluding that doing so would aid its adjudication of his habeas petition. But the court never determined how, in light of the limitations on its review described above, newly developed evidence could aid Twyford's cause. See Twyford v. Warden, 2020 WL 1308318, *4 (S.D. Ohio, Mar. 19, 2020) (the Court does not find itself in a position at this stage of proceedings to make a determination as to whether or to what extent it would be precluded by Cullen v. Pinholster from considering any new evidence). Nor did the Sixth Circuit. See 11 F.4th at 527 (At this stage, on review of Twyford's interlocutory appeal seeking a transport order, we  need not consider the admissibility of any resulting evidence.). For the reasons just discussed, that was error.",Roberts,0,
2021-067,49,"Reviewing Twyford's request for transportation under the proper standard is straightforward, because his motion sheds no light on how he might persuade a court to consider the results of his testing, given the limitations AEDPA imposes on presenting new evidence. He argued that it is plausible that the testing to be administered is likely to reveal evidence in support of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and expert witness, lack of competency to stand trial, and the involuntariness of his confession. Motion to Transport 8. Whether or not that is true, Twyford never explained how the results of the neurological testing could be admissible in his habeas proceeding, and it is hard to see how they could be. The Ohio courts already adjudicated and rejected most of these claims on the merits, and the District Court's AEDPA review will therefore be limited to the record that was before the state court. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 181, 131 S.Ct. 1388. As for the claims that the state courts did not consider, Twyford never argued that he could clear the bar in § 2254(e)(2) for expanding the state court record, or that the bar was somehow inapplicable.",Roberts,0,
2021-067,50,"Twyford asserted in passing that the desired evidence could plausibly bear on the question whether to excuse procedural default. Motion to Transport 8. By way of background, a federal court may not review a claim a habeas petitioner failed to adequately present to state courts, unless he shows cause to excuse his failure to comply with the state procedural rule and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation. Davila v. Davis, 582 U. S. ___, ___ 137 S.Ct. 2058, 2064-65, 198 L.Ed.2d 603 (2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Twyford suggested that the results of his brain testing could help make that showing. But he did not identify the particular defaulted claims he hopes to resurrect, nor did he explain how the testing would matter to his ability to do so. And in any event, this Court has already held that, if § 2254(e)(2) applies and the prisoner cannot meet the statute's standards for admitting new merits evidence, it serves no purpose to develop such evidence just to assess cause and prejudice. See Shinn, 596 U. S., at ___ 142 S.Ct., at 1738 (when a federal habeas court  admits or reviews new evidence for any purpose, it may not consider that evidence on the merits of a negligent prisoner's defaulted claim unless the exceptions in § 2254(e)(2) are satisfied).

Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Too many interlocutory appeals could slow down the workings of the judicial system. That can lead to a number of harms, including, e.g., making it more difficult for trial judges to do their basic job—supervising trial proceedings, threatening those proceedings with delay, adding costs and diminishing coherence, and risking additional, and unnecessary, appellate court work.

Cohen, 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221. But we have repeatedly stated that this doctrine is a `narrow' exception that should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered. Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 868, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994) (citation omitted), see also Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 350, 126 S.Ct. 952, 163 L.Ed.2d 836 (2006) (Although the Court has been asked many times to expand the `small class' of collaterally appealable orders, we have instead kept it narrow and selective in its membership), Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 113, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (Rulemaking, `not expansion by court decision,' is the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable).",Breyer,0,
2021-067,59,"We must therefore exercise caution before extending the collateral order doctrine. We have stringently limited that  doctrine to only those district court orders 1 that are conclusive, 2 that resolve important questions completely separate from the merits, and 3 that would render such important questions effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment in the underlying action. Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U.S. at 867-868, 114 S.Ct. 1992.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,62,"The Court today extends the collateral order doctrine to a new category of orders, which it describes as transportation orders issued under the All Writs Act. Ante, at 2043, n. 1. The Court believes these kinds of orders are collateral and therefore immediately appealable because, it says, they (1) conclusively require transportation, (2) resolve an important question of state sovereignty conceptually distinct from the merits of the prisoner's claims, and (3) are entirely unreviewable by the time the case has gone to final judgment. Ibid. (citation omitted). I agree that orders like the one at issue here conclusively require transportation and are largely unreviewable by the time the case has gone to final judgment. Ibid. But I do not agree that such orders resolve an important question of state sovereignty conceptually distinct from the merits of the prisoner's claims. Ibid. That is so for three reasons.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,63,"First, transportation orders do not appear to me to be especially important. Even if those orders are unreviewable after final judgment, we have said that the mere identification of some interest that would be `irretrievably lost' has never sufficed, on its own, to justify interlocutory appeal. Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U.S. at 872, 114 S.Ct. 1992. Rather, the order must implicate `a substantial public interest' or `some particular value of a high order.' Mohawk Industries, Inc., 558 U.S. at 107, 130 S.Ct. 599. It is difficult to see how transportation orders of the kind at issue here meet that requirement. The order is analogous to a discovery order because it requires the State to transport a prisoner for medical testing in order to develop evidence relating to the prisoner's habeas claims. See ante, at 2041, 2044 2045 (comparing requirements for a transportation order to requirements for discovery and for an evidentiary hearing). I see no reason why such an order ordinarily should be of greater importance than a discovery order of some other kind.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,64,"We have held that discovery orders are not immediately appealable, even where discovery would require revealing privileged information that, once shared, could not be unshared if the disclosing party prevailed on appeal after final judgment. Mohawk Industries, Inc., 558 U.S. at 108-109, 130 S.Ct. 599. Why should discovery-like transportation orders be immediately appealable when ordinary discovery orders are not? Neither touches upon substantial public interests. And, in both instances, the harms of interlocutory appeal are significant while the countervailing benefits are minimal.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,65,"Take first the harms. As I said above, interlocutory appeals unduly delay the resolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden the courts of appeals. See id., at 112, 130 S.Ct. 599. In this case, for example, the appeal of the District Court's transportation order has lasted over two years. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a (order entered March 19, 2020). If interlocutory appeals were permitted as of right in all similar cases requiring transportation of a prisoner, the resulting delays would impair the ability of district courts to manage their own dockets and supervise trial proceedings.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,66,"By comparison, the benefits of interlocutory appeal here are small. District courts, not appellate courts, have comparative expertise in deciding when evidentiary development is appropriate and when transportation orders are necessary to facilitate that development. See Johnson, 515 U.S. at 317, 115 S.Ct. 2151. As a result, interlocutory appeal is unlikely to bring important error-correcting benefits in most cases. Id., at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. In the rare case where an erroneous transportation order happens to implicate unusually important interests, a State has other avenues for addressing that error. It can ask district courts to certify a discretionary interlocutory appeal under § 1292(b), seek a writ of mandamus, or defy the order and incur a court-imposed sanction, which may then itself be appealed immediately in some cases. See Mohawk Industries Inc., 558 U.S. at 110-112, 130 S.Ct. 599. Those avenues—sufficient to protect against errors in discovery, see ibid.—should generally be sufficient for transportation-related errors as well.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,67,"Second, the Court overstates transportation orders' impact on state sovereignty. See ante, at 2043, n. 1. The Court of Appeals noted respondent's argument that discovery orders generally are not appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, but it distinguished the transportation order at issue here on the ground that it implicates  a federal court's authority to compel state action. 11 F.4th 518, 523 (C.A.6 2021). But the mere fact that the appealing party is a State is not, on its own, enough to justify interlocutory appeal. We have never suggested, for example, that a discovery order against a State is immediately appealable simply because it imposes costs on a sovereign State. To allow interlocutory appeal on such grounds would create an anomaly: The State would be able to immediately appeal a discovery order entered against it, but an opposing party would not.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,68,"The Court suggests that the transportation order here is not a mere discovery order because it requires a State to take a convicted felon outside the prison's walls. Ante, at 2043, n. 1. The Court says doing so creates public safety risks and burdens on the State that cannot be remedied after final judgment. Ibid. But what exactly are those risks? The order here requires transporting respondent to a medical center—the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. 11 F.4th at 520. That medical center is the official prison hospital, which has the security and other infrastructure to safely accommodate prisoners and does so regularly. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 57-58. Respondent tells us that he has personally been transported between the prison and the medical center 16 times without incident. Id., at 57.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,69,"Other orders might well create similar kinds of risks. A writ of habeas corpus might require the State to transport a prisoner to court to testify or for trial, see § 2241(c)(5), or an order appointing a psychiatrist or other expert to conduct a psychological examination might require the State to allow access to a dangerous prisoner, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 35(a). Would the Court's logic require that all such orders with security risks be immediately appealable? That would be a dramatic extension of the collateral order doctrine, which we have said should remain `narrow,' Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U.S. at 868, 114 S.Ct. 1992 (emphasis added).",Breyer,0,
2021-067,70,"Finally, we have also said that some interlocutory appeals make unwise use of appellate courts' time, by forcing them to decide in the context of a less developed record, an issue very similar to one they may well decide anyway later, on a record that will permit a better decision. Johnson,  515 U.S. at 317, 115 S.Ct. 2151. That warning is applicable here. The question whether the transportation order was proper under the All Writs Act is not conceptually distinct from the merits of respondent's habeas claims. In order to obtain a transportation order, the Court says, a prisoner must show that the desired evidence would be admissible in connection with a particular claim for relief. Ante, at 2046. Of course, at this early stage, a district court's assessment of that issue is only preliminary because it cannot know for certain what evidence will be revealed. After the evidence is developed, the court will need to make a final determination of whether it is in fact admissible. Requiring appellate courts to review both the district court's preliminary assessment of admissibility on interlocutory appeal and its ultimate assessment of the same question after final judgment is unnecessarily duplicative and inefficient.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,71,All of these concerns suggest that transportation orders like the one here do not satisfy the requirements for interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine.,Breyer,0,
2021-067,73,"The Court points out in response that every Court of Appeals to consider the question has found a transportation order to be immediately appealable. Ante, at 2043, n. 1. True. But few Courts of Appeals have been asked to consider the question. The Court cites, over the last five decades, only four cases (besides this one) that have concluded that transportation orders are immediately appealable. Ibid. (citing Jones v. Lilly, 37 F.3d 964, 965-966 (C.A.3 1994), Jackson v. Vasquez, 1 F.3d 885, 887-888 (C.A.9 1993), Ballard v. Spradley, 557 F.2d 476, 479 (C.A.5 1977), Barnes v. Black, 544 F.3d 807, 810-811 (C.A.7 2008)). An average of one decision every decade can hardly be thought to establish a lower court consensus. A contrary determination here would not disturb settled practice.",Breyer,0,
2021-067,74,"The Court also asserts that, on one occasion, we have previously reviewed a transportation order. See Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U.S. 34, 106 S.Ct. 355, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985). But the precedential value of that decision is limited because the opinion did not discuss the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal from the order. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 511, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). It does not set forth a jurisdictional ruling at all.* * *",Breyer,0,

2021-067,77,"The Court granted review to decide whether and under what circumstances a federal district court may order a State to transport a prisoner to a hospital for testing. Later, however, it became clear a potential jurisdictional defect threatened to preclude the Court from reaching that question. The District Court's transportation ruling was an interlocutory order, not a final judgment. To address its merits, the Court would first have to extend the collateral order doctrine to a new class of cases. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-547, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). In a terse footnote today, the Court does just that. Ante, at 2043, n. 1.",Gorsuch,0,

Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 113, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009).

2021-068,27,"In 2011, a federal jury convicted Dexter Kemp of various drug and gun crimes, and he was sentenced to 420 months in prison. Kemp, along with seven codefendants, appealed. The Eleventh Circuit consolidated their appeals and, in November 2013, affirmed their convictions and sentences. United States v. Gray, 544 Fed.Appx. 870. Kemp did not seek rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit's judgment or petition this Court for certiorari. Two of Kemp's codefendants did seek rehearing, which the Eleventh Circuit denied in May 2014.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,28,"In April 2015, Kemp moved the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. The Government objected that Kemp's § 2255 motion was untimely. As relevant here, such motions must be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final. § 2255(f)(1). For someone who, like Kemp, does not petition this Court for certiorari, a judgment becomes final when the time to seek certiorari expires —ordinarily, 90 days after judgment. See Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 525, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003), this Court's Rule 13.1. In this case, the District Court concluded that Kemp's judgment became final in February 2014 (90 days after the Eleventh Circuit's judgment affirming his conviction and sentence), making his April 2015 motion over two months late. The District Court dismissed Kemp's motion in September 2016, and Kemp did not appeal.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,29,"In June 2018—almost two years later— Kemp attempted to reopen his § 2255 proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), which authorizes a court to reopen a final judgment under certain enumerated circumstances. Rule 60(b)(1) permits a district court to reopen a judgment for mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, so long as the motion is filed within a reasonable time, and, at most, one year after the entry of the order under review. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), (c)(1). Meanwhile, Rule 60(b)(6) permits reopening for any other reason that justifies relief, so long as the motion is filed within a reasonable time.

2021-068,30,"Kemp invoked Rule 60(b)(6), but his motion arguably sought reopening based on a kind of mistake covered by Rule 60(b)(1). Specifically, Kemp argued that reopening was warranted because this Court's Rule 13.3 prescribes that the 90-day clock to seek certiorari does not begin to run until all parties' petitions for rehearing are denied, and the Eleventh Circuit denied his codefendants' rehearing petitions in May 2014. Thus, according to Kemp, the 1-year period to file his § 2255 motion began in  August 2014, making his April 2015 motion timely.",Thomas,0,

While it agreed with Kemp that his original § 2255 motion appeared to have been timely, the Eleventh Circuit nonetheless concluded that he had filed his Rule 60(b) motion too late. Id., at 575-576. The Eleventh Circuit held that Kemp's reopening motion alleged precisely the sort of judicial mistake in applying the relevant law that Rule 60(b)(1) encompasses, and thus was subject to Rule 60(b)(1)'s 1-year limitations period. Id., at 576.",Thomas,0,

According to Kemp, however, Rule 60(b)(1) applies only to factual errors made by someone other than the judge. Brief for Petitioner 3. So, in Kemp's view, his motion challenging the District Court's timeliness ruling was cognizable under Rule 60(b)(6), and the 1-year limit did not apply.",Thomas,0,

As a matter of text, structure, and history, the Government is correct that a mistake  under Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge's errors of law. But we see no reason to limit Rule 60(b)(1) to obvious legal mistakes, as the Government proposes. We first explain why Rule 60(b)(1) covers all mistakes of law made by a judge, and then address why the Government's and Kemp's contrary interpretations of mistake do not persuade us.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,39,"The ordinary meaning of the term mistake in Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge's legal errors. When the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in 1946, the word mistake applied to any misconception, misunderstanding, or fault in opinion or judgment. Webster's New International Dictionary 1383 (1914) (Webster's), see also Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 1588 (1944) (Funk & Wagnalls) (defining mistake as an error in action, judgment, or perceptions, including, e.g., a mistake in calculation). In ordinary usage, then, a mistake was not limited only to factual misconceptions or misunderstandings, or to mistakes by non-judicial actors. Webster's 1383. Likewise, in its legal usage, mistake included errors of law or fact. Black's Law Dictionary 1195 (3d ed. 1933) (Black's). Thus, regardless whether mistake in Rule 60(b)(1) carries its ordinary meaning or legal meaning, it includes a judge's mistakes of law.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,40,"Had the drafters of Rule 60(b)(1) intended a narrower meaning, they easily could have drafted language to that effect. Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169, 134 S.Ct. 736, 187 L.Ed.2d 654 (2014). The difference between mistake of fact and mistake of law was well known at the time. Both lay and legal dictionaries identified them as distinct categories. See Funk & Wagnalls 1588, Black's 1195. Thus, Rule 60(b)(1)'s drafters had at their disposal readily available language that could have connoted a narrower understanding of mistake. Yet they chose to include mistake unqualified.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,41,"Similarly, Rule 60(b)(1)'s drafters could just as easily have excluded mistakes by judges from the Rule's ambit. In fact, the Rule used to read that way. When adopted in 1938, Rule 60(b) initially referred to his—i.e., a party's—mistake, so judicial errors were not covered. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b) (1938). In 1946, however, the Rule's amenders deleted the word his, thereby removing any limitation on whose mistakes could qualify. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1) (1946). Thus, as currently written, mistake in Rule 60(b)(1) includes legal errors made by judges.2",Thomas,0,
2021-068,43,Both the Government's and Kemp's interpretations of Rule 60(b) depart from aspects of our reading. Their reasons for doing so are unavailing.,Thomas,0,
2021-068,45,"The Government contends that the term mistake encompasses only so-called obvious legal errors. Brief for United States 11. Several Courts of Appeals agree that Rule 60(b)(1) may be used to correct only `obvious errors' of law, such as overlooking controlling statutes or case law. In re Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp. S. A., 728 F.2d 699, 703 (C.A.5 1984). The Government argues that this limitation has  historical roots because courts of equity traditionally could grant relief from legal errors, but only `in the most unquestionable and flagrant cases.' Brief for United States 18 (quoting Snell v. Insurance Co., 98 U.S. 85, 91, 25 L.Ed. 52 (1878)).",Thomas,0,
2021-068,46,"We are unconvinced. None of the English language or legal dictionaries noted above, supra, at 1861-1862, suggests this obviousness gloss. Nor does the Government tie the equity practice it invokes to the text or history of Rule 60(b). Finally, we question the administrability of a rule that requires courts to decide not only whether there was a mistake but also whether that mistake was sufficiently obvious. The text does not support—let alone require—that judges engage in this sort of complex line-drawing.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,48,"We are similarly unconvinced by Kemp's arguments for limiting Rule 60(b)(1) to non-judicial, non-legal errors.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,49,"While Kemp does not dispute that mistake ordinarily would cover both legal and factual errors, he argues that the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b)(1)— inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect—involve exclusively non-legal, non-judicial errors, and the word mistake should therefore be similarly limited. But courts have long found that excusable neglect may involve legal error. See, e.g., Lenaghan v. Pepsico, Inc., 961 F.2d 1250, 1254-1255 (C.A.6 1992) (per curiam) (understandable, albeit mistaken, reading of a local rule), A. F. Dormeyer Co. v. M. J. Sales & Distributing Co., 461 F.2d 40, 42-43 (C.A.7 1972) (misunderstanding of summons and relevant legal rules), Provident Security Life Ins. Co. v. Gorsuch, 323 F.2d 839, 843 (C.A.9 1963) (erroneous understanding of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12). And they have a similar history of granting relief based on judicial inadvertence. Larson v. Heritage Square Assocs., 952 F.2d 1533, 1536 (C.A.8 1992) (emphasis added), see also, e.g., O'Tell v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 236 F.2d 472, 475 (C.A.2 1956) (judge's failure to deduct setoff in entering judgment was inadvertence under Rule 60(b)). Because the words surrounding mistake in Rule 60(b)(1) do not connote exclusively non-legal or non-judicial errors, they do not favor Kemp's narrower reading.",Thomas,0,
2021-068,50,"Kemp also argues that Rule 60's structure favors interpreting the term mistake narrowly. Our interpretation, he contends, would create confusing overlap between Rule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(a), which authorizes a court to correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. We disagree. Because Rule 60(a) covers a subset of mistakes—e.g., clerical ones—whereas Rule 60(b)(1) covers mistakes simpliciter, the overlap Kemp alleges would exist even if mistake reached only factual errors. And the Courts of Appeals have well-established rules for determining when Rule 60(a), rather than Rule 60(b), should apply. See, e.g., United States v. Griffin, 782 F.2d 1393, 1397 (C.A.7 1986).",Thomas,0,
2021-068,51,"Kemp alleges that our interpretation of Rule 60(b)(1) would create a similar problem with respect to Rules 60(b)(4) and (b)(5), which authorize relief from voided judgments and judgments that lack legal effect. Specifically, Kemp contends that a legal mistake could warrant relief under both Rule 60(b)(1) and Rule 60(b)(4) or Rule (b)(5), and a conflict could then arise given that the latter Rules are not subject to a 1-year time limit. But, again, that could occur even if only factual errors count as mistakes, since factual errors, too, may justify relief under Rules 60(b)(4) and (b)(5). And, regardless, should this  overlap ever create an irreconcilable conflict, courts may then resort to ordinary rules of statutory construction when selecting which provision would govern in a particular case. See, e.g., RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645, 132 S.Ct. 2065, 182 L.Ed.2d 967 (2012) (`the specific governs the general').",Thomas,0,
2021-068,52,"Kemp also worries that our interpretation would allow parties to evade other time limits set forth in the Federal Rules. For instance, Rule 59(e) motions to alter or amend a judgment must be filed within 28 days, and appeals must generally be filed within 30 days, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(a). Kemp suggests that our interpretation would allow someone to repackage a tardy Rule 59(e) motion as a timely Rule 60(b)(1) motion, or to generate a right to an untimely appeal by filing a Rule 60(b)(1) motion and appealing once it is denied. We are unpersuaded because, yet again, the risk Kemp identifies would exist even under his own interpretation. For example, Kemp provides no explanation why, under his interpretation of Rule 60(b), parties could not repackage tardy Rule 59(e) motions based on legal errors as motions under Rule 60(b)(6), or recharacterize tardy motions based on factual errors as motions under Rule 60(b)(1). A denial in either case would then permit the litigant to appeal outside Appellate Rule 4's 30-day time limit.",Thomas,0,

Moreover, at least one leading treatise from the era maintained, consistent with our view, that mistake encompassed legal errors. See 3 J. Moore & J.

He argues that Rule 60(b)(6) alone was intended to afford relief for  judicial legal errors that had previously been remedied by bills of review, because such errors were not cognizable under Rule 60(b)'s mistake provision or its predecessor state rules prior to the 1946 amendments. But, as noted, the preamendment Rule 60(b) covered only a party's mistakes, see supra, at 1862-1863, and for that reason could not be grounds to correct a judge's legal mistake.

2021-068,64,"From the start, granting review was a questionable use of judicial resources. The answer matters only under rare circumstances: A losing party fails to appeal or secure relief under Rule 59(e), opting instead to file a Rule 60(b) motion. That motion comes more than a year after judgment but—piling contingency on contingency —within what the court would otherwise deem a reasonable time. Rule 60(c)(1). By petitioner's own (uncontested) count, his is the first petition ever to present today's question for this Court's review. See Pet. for Cert. 24, Brief in Opposition 26. Beyond even that, an alternative route exists to resolve the question posed here. Congress has adopted the Rules Enabling Act. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2071-2077.

Or do Rule 59(e) and the appellate process provide the necessary corrective measures in ordinary cases, with Rule 60(b)(6) as a last, narrow avenue to relief? Questions like these are best resolved not through a doubtful interpretive project focused on a pronoun dropped in 1946, but through the rulemaking process.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals, however, held that doing so would violate the Immigration and Nationality Act, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States. The District Court also held that the attempted rescission of the program was inadequately explained in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.

MPP provided that certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico would be returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.

In light of that fact, the Trump administration chose to implement MPP in part so that certain aliens attempting to enter the U. S. illegally or without documentation, including those who claim asylum, will no longer be released into the country, where they often fail to file an asylum application and/or disappear before an immigration judge can determine the merits of any claim. 554 F.Supp.3d, at 832.",Roberts,0,

Because the Government was unable to meet its detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court concluded, terminating MPP necessarily leads to the systemic violation of Section 1225 as aliens are released into the United States.

2021-069,57,We begin with jurisdiction. The Government contends that the injunction the District Court entered was barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). That provision reads as follows:,Roberts,0,
2021-069,58,"Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1232, other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under those provisions have been initiated.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,59,"As we recently held in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2057, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022), section 1252(f)(1) generally prohibits lower courts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions. Id., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2065. The District Court's injunction in this case violated that provision. But that fact simply presents us with the following question: whether section 1252(f)(1) deprives this Court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of an appeal, where the lower court entered a form of relief barred by that provision. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (Every federal appellate court has an obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it. (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,60,"Absent section 1252(f)(1), the District Court clearly had federal question jurisdiction over respondents' suit, which asserted claims arising under two federal statutes, the INA and the APA. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.). The question, then, is whether section 1252(f)(1)  strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction over these claims. The parties agree that the answer to that question is no, and so do we. That is because section 1252(f)(1) withdraws a district court's jurisdiction or authority to grant a particular form of relief. It does not deprive the lower courts of all subject matter jurisdiction over claims brought under sections 1221 through 1232 of the INA.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,61,"The text of the provision makes that clear. Section 1252(f)(1) deprives courts of the power to issue a specific category of remedies: those that enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant sections of the statute. A limitation on subject matter jurisdiction, by contrast, restricts a court's power to adjudicate a case. United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Section 1252(f)(1) bears no indication that lower courts lack power to hear any claim brought under sections 1221 through 1232. If Congress had wanted the provision to have that effect, it could have said so in words far simpler than those that it wrote. But Congress instead provided that lower courts would lack jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant provisions, and it included that language in a provision whose title—Limit on injunctive relief —makes clear the narrowness of its scope.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,62,"A second feature of the text of section 1252(f)(1) leaves no doubt that this Court has jurisdiction: the parenthetical explicitly preserving this Court's power to enter injunctive relief. See § 1252(f)(1) (No court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority ). If section 1252(f)(1) deprived lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate any non-individual claims under sections 1221 through 1232, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provision's specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory. Indeed, that carveout seems directed at precisely the question before us here: whether section 1252(f)(1)'s limit on injunctive relief has any consequence for the jurisdiction of this Court. Congress took pains to answer that question in the negative. Interpreting section 1252(f)(1) to deprive this Court of jurisdiction under these circumstances would therefore fail to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of the statute. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).2",Roberts,0,
2021-069,63,"Statutory structure confirms our conclusion. Elsewhere in section 1252, where Congress intended to deny subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims, it did so unambiguously. Section 1252(a)(2), for instance, is entitled Matters not subject to judicial review and provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review several categories of decisions, such as any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense . (Emphasis added.) Congress could easily have added one more item to this list: any action taken pursuant to sections 1221 through 1232. Or it could have worded section 1252(f)(1) similarly to the immediately adjacent section 1252(g), which provides that no court shall have  jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against the alien. (Emphasis added.) But Congress did neither. Instead, it constructed a carefully worded provision depriving the lower courts of power to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain sections of the statute, and it entitled that provision a limit on injunctive relief.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,64,"Our prior cases have already embraced this straightforward conclusion. Most relevantly, the Court previously encountered a virtually identical situation in Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 954, 203 L.Ed.2d 333 (2019). There, as here, the plaintiffs sought declaratory as well as injunctive relief in their complaint, and there, as here, the District Court awarded only the latter. Yet this Court proceeded to reach the merits of the suit, notwithstanding the District Court's apparent violation of section 1252(f)(1), by reasoning that whether the District Court had jurisdiction to enter such an injunction is irrelevant because the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief. Id., at ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct., at 962 (ALITO, J., joined by ROBERTS, C. J., and KAVANAUGH, J.), see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 875, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018) (BREYER, J., joined by Ginsburg and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., dissenting) (concluding that a court could order declaratory relief notwithstanding section 1252(f)(1)). Our disposition in Preap is inconsistent with an interpretation of the limitation in section 1252(f)(1) that strips the lower courts of subject matter jurisdiction.3 And previous statements from this Court regarding section 1252(f)(1) are in accord. See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 481, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (By its plain terms, and even by its title, section 1252(f)(1) is nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief.).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,65,"In short, we see no basis for the conclusion that section 1252(f)(1) concerns subject matter jurisdiction. It is true that section 1252(f)(1) uses the phrase jurisdiction or authority, rather than simply the word authority. But jurisdiction  is a word of many, too many meanings. Steel Co., 523 U.S., at 90, 118 S.Ct. 1003. And the question whether a court has jurisdiction to grant a particular remedy is different from the question whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a particular class of claims. See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 163-164, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 176 L.Ed.2d 18 (2010) (concluding that the word `jurisdiction'  says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims). Section 1252(f)(1) no doubt deprives the lower courts of jurisdiction to grant classwide injunctive relief. See Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U. S., at ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2068. But that limitation poses no obstacle to jurisdiction in this Court.4  III",Roberts,0,
2021-069,66,"We now turn to the merits. Section 1225(b)(2)(C) provides: In the case of an alien  who is arriving on land  from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States, the Secretary may return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a. Section 1225(b)(2)(C) plainly confers a discretionary authority to return aliens to Mexico during the pendency of their immigration proceedings. This Court has repeatedly observed that the word `may' clearly connotes discretion. Opati v. Republic of Sudan, 590 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 1601, 1609, 206 L.Ed.2d 904 (2020) (emphasis in original), see also, e.g., Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___, 139 S.Ct. 361, 371, 202 L.Ed.2d 269 (2018), Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 346, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005). The use of the word may in section 1225(b)(2)(C) thus makes clear that contiguous-territory return is a tool that the Secretary has the authority, but not the duty, to use. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230, 241, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,67,"Respondents and the Court of Appeals concede this point. Brief for Respondents 21 (contiguous-territory return is a discretionary authority), 20 F.4th, at 996, n. 18 (It's obviously true that § 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionary.). They base their interpretation instead on section 1225(b)(2)(A), which provides that, in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title. Respondents and the Court of Appeals thus urge an inference from the statutory structure: Because section 1225(b)(2)(A) makes detention mandatory, they argue, the otherwise-discretionary return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) becomes mandatory when the Secretary violates that detention mandate.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,68,"The problem is that the statute does not say anything like that. The statute says may. And may does not just suggest discretion, it clearly connotes it. Opati, 590 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1609 (emphasis in original), see also Jama, 543 U.S., at 346, 125 S.Ct. 694 (That connotation is particularly apt where, as here, `may' is used in contraposition to the word `shall.'). Congress's use of the word may is therefore inconsistent with respondents' proposed inference from the statutory structure. If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Government's detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term may. It would surely instead have coupled that grant of discretion with some indication of its sometimes-mandatory nature —perhaps by providing that the Secretary may return certain aliens to Mexico, unless the government fails to comply with its detention obligations, in which case the Secretary must return them. The statutory grant of discretion here contains no such caveat, and we will not rewrite it to include one. See id., at 341, 125 S.Ct. 694 (We do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,69,"The principal dissent emphasizes that section 1225(b)(2)(A) requires detention of all aliens that fall within its terms. See, e.g., post, at 2553 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (The language of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal.). While the Government  contests that proposition, we assume arguendo for purposes of this opinion that the dissent's interpretation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) is correct, and that the Government is currently violating its obligations under that provision.5 Even so, the dissent's conclusions regarding section 1225(b)(2)(C) do not follow. Under the actual text of the statute, Justice ALITO's interpretation is practically self-refuting. He emphasizes that `shall be detained' means `shall be detained,' post, at 2554, and criticizes the Government's argument that `shall' means `may,' post, at 2554. But the theory works both ways. Congress conferred contiguous-territory return authority in expressly discretionary terms. `May return the alien' means `may return the alien.' The desire to redress the Government's purported violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A) does not justify transforming the nature of the authority conferred by section 1225(b)(2)(C).6",Roberts,0,
2021-069,70,"The historical context in which the provision was adopted confirms the plain import of its text. See, e.g., Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 1474, 1482, 209 L.Ed.2d 433 (2021) (textual analysis confirmed by a wider look at the statute's structure and history). Section 1225(b)(2)(C) was not added to the statute until 1996, in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), § 302, 110 Stat. 300-583— more than 90 years after the Immigration Act of 1903 added the shall be detained language that appears in section 1225(b)(2)(A). And section 1225(b)(2)(C) was enacted in the immediate aftermath of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision that specifically called into question the legality of the contiguous-territory return practice. Prior to that decision, the longstanding practice of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had been to require some aliens arriving at land border ports of entry to await their exclusion proceedings in Canada or Mexico. The BIA noted the lack of any evidence that this is a practice known to Congress and the absence of a supporting regulation. In re Sanchez-Avila, 21 I. & N. Dec. 444, 465 (1996) (en banc). Congress responded mere months later by adding section 1225(b)(2)(C) to IIRIRA and conferring on the Secretary express authority (may) to engage in the very practice that the BIA had questioned. And INS acknowledged that clarification shortly thereafter, explaining that section 1225(b)(2)(C) and its implementing regulation simply add to the statute and regulation a long-standing practice of the Service. 62 Fed. Reg. 445 (1997). That modest backstory suggests a more humble role for section 1225(b)(2)(C) than as a mandatory safety valve for any  alien who is not detained under section 1225(b)(2)(A).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,71,"In addition to contradicting the statutory text and context, the novelty of respondents' interpretation bears mention. Since IIRIRA's enactment 26 years ago, every Presidential administration has interpreted section 1225(b)(2)(C) as purely discretionary. Indeed, at the time of IIRIRA's enactment and in the decades since, congressional funding has consistently fallen well short of the amount needed to detain all land-arriving inadmissible aliens at the border, yet no administration has ever used section 1225(b)(2)(C) to return all such aliens that it could not otherwise detain.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,72,"And the foreign affairs consequences of mandating the exercise of contiguous-territory return likewise confirm that the Court of Appeals erred. Article II of the Constitution authorizes the Executive to engage in direct diplomacy with foreign heads of state and their ministers. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 14, 135 S.Ct. 2076, 192 L.Ed.2d 83 (2015). Accordingly, the Court has taken care to avoid the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy, and declined to run interference in the delicate field of international relations without the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 115-116, 133 S.Ct. 1659, 185 L.Ed.2d 671 (2013). That is no less true in the context of immigration law, where the dynamic nature of relations with other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nation's foreign policy. Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 397, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,73,"By interpreting section 1225(b)(2)(C) as a mandate, the Court of Appeals imposed a significant burden upon the Executive's ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico. MPP applies exclusively to non-Mexican nationals who have arrived at ports of entry that are located in the United States. § 1225(a)(1). The Executive therefore cannot unilaterally return these migrants to Mexico. In attempting to rescind MPP, the Secretary emphasized that efforts to implement MPP have played a particularly outsized role in diplomatic engagements with Mexico, diverting attention from more productive efforts to fight transnational criminal and smuggling networks and address the root causes of migration. App. to Pet. for Cert. 262a. Yet under the Court of Appeals' interpretation, section 1225(b)(2)(C) authorized the District Court to force the Executive to the bargaining table with Mexico, over a policy that both countries wish to terminate, and to supervise its continuing negotiations with Mexico to ensure that they are conducted in good faith. 554 F.Supp.3d, at 857 (emphasis deleted). That stark consequence confirms our conclusion that Congress did not intend section 1225(b)(2)(C) to tie the hands of the Executive in this manner.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,74,"Finally, we note that—as DHS explained in its October 29 Memoranda—the INA expressly authorizes DHS to process applicants for admission under a third option: parole. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). Every administration, including the Trump and Biden administrations, has utilized this authority to some extent. Importantly, the authority is not unbounded: DHS may exercise its discretion to parole applicants only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. Ibid. And under the APA, DHS's exercise of discretion within that statutory framework must be reasonable and reasonably explained. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,75,"29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). But the availability of the parole option additionally makes clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the INA required the Government to continue implementing MPP.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,76,"In sum, the contiguous-territory return authority in section 1225(b)(2)(C) is discretionary —and remains discretionary notwithstanding any violation of section 1225(b)(2)(A). To reiterate: we need not and do not resolve the parties' arguments regarding whether section 1225(b)(2)(A) must be read in light of traditional principles of law enforcement discretion, and whether the Government is lawfully exercising its parole authorities pursuant to sections 1182(d)(5) and 1226(a). We merely hold that section 1225(b)(2)(C) means what it says: may means may, and the INA itself does not require the Secretary to continue exercising his discretionary authority under these circumstances.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,78,"The Court of Appeals also erred in holding that the October 29 Memoranda did not constitute a new and separately reviewable `final agency action.' 20 F.4th, at 951. To recap, the Secretary first attempted to terminate MPP through the June 1 Memorandum. As the Court of Appeals correctly held, that constituted final agency action. See id., at 947 (citing Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997)). But the District Court found that the Secretary's stated grounds in the June 1 Memorandum were inadequate, and therefore vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded the matter to DHS for further consideration. 554 F.Supp.3d, at 857.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,79,"As we explained two Terms ago in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 591 U. S. ___, 140 S.Ct. 1891, 207 L.Ed.2d 353 (2020), upon finding that the grounds for agency action are inadequate, a court may remand for the agency to do one of two things. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1907. First, the agency can offer `a fuller explanation of the agency's reasoning at the time of the agency action.' Ibid. (emphasis deleted). If it chooses this route, the agency may elaborate on its initial reasons for taking the action, but may not provide new ones. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908. Alternatively, the agency can `deal with the problem afresh' by taking new agency action. Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 201, 67 S.Ct. 1760, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (Chenery II)). An agency taking this route is not limited to its prior reasons. Regents, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,80,"Here, perhaps in light of this Court's previous determination that the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the June 1 Memorandum was not arbitrary and capricious, 594 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 926, 210 L.Ed.2d 1014, the Secretary selected the second option from Regents: He accepted the District Court's vacatur and dealt with the problem afresh. The October 29 Memoranda made that clear by its own terms, Regents, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908, in which the Secretary stated: I am hereby terminating MPP. Effective immediately, I hereby supersede and rescind the June 1 memorandum. App. to Pet. for Cert. 263a-264a. And consistent with that approach, the October 29 Memoranda offered several new reasons absent from the June 1 Memorandum, Regents, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908, including an examination of the considerations that the District Court determined were insufficiently addressed in the June 1 memo, App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,81,"The October 29 Memoranda were therefore final agency action for the same  reasons that the June 1 Memorandum was final agency action. That is, both the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda, when they were issued, marked the `consummation' of the agency's decisionmaking process and resulted in rights and obligations being determined. Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154. As the Court of Appeals explained, the June 1 Memorandum bound DHS staff by forbidding them to continue the program in any way from that moment on. 20 F.4th, at 947. That rationale also applies to the October 29 Memoranda, which were therefore final agency action under the APA.7",Roberts,0,
2021-069,82,"The various rationales offered by respondents and the Court of Appeals in support of the contrary conclusion lack merit.8 First, the Court of Appeals framed the question by postulating the existence of an agency decision wholly apart from any agency statement of general or particular applicability  designed to implement that decision. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4), see 20 F.4th, at 950-951 (The States are challenging the Termination Decision—not the June 1 Memorandum, the October 29 Memoranda, or any other memo.). To the extent that the Court of Appeals understood itself to be reviewing an abstract decision apart from specific agency action, as defined in the APA, that was error. It was not the case that the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda simply explained DHS's decision, while only the decision itself had legal effect. Id., at 951. To the contrary, the June 1 Memorandum and the October 29 Memoranda were themselves the operative agency actions, each of them an agency statement  designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,83,"Second, and relatedly, respondents characterized the October 29 Memoranda as post hoc rationalizations of the June 1 Memorandum under our decision in Regents. Brief for Respondents 40 (The October 29 Memoranda are nothing more than improper, post hoc rationalizations for terminating MPP.), see also 20 F.4th, at 961 (questioning how the October 29 Memoranda could be anything more than post hoc rationalizations of the Termination Decision). But Regents involved the exact opposite situation from this one. There, as here, DHS had attempted to rescind a prior administration's immigration policy, but a District Court found the rescission inadequately explained. Faced with the same two options outlined above,  then-Secretary Nielsen elected the first option rather than the second. That is, she chose to rest on the original Memorandum while elaborating on her prior reasoning, rather than issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the original Memorandum. 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908. As such, her elaboration was limited to the agency's original reasons, and was `viewed critically' to ensure that the rescission was not upheld on the basis of impermissible `post hoc rationalization.' Id., at ___ - ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908. And because the then-Secretary's reasoning had little relationship to that of her predecessor, the Court characterized the new explanations as impermissible post hoc rationalizations  not properly before us. Id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1909.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,84,"The prohibition on post hoc rationalization applies only when the agency proceeds by the first option from Regents. Under that circumstance, because the agency has chosen to rest on its original action while elaborating on its prior reasoning, id., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908, the bar on post hoc rationalization operates to ensure that the agency's supplemental explanation is anchored to the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action, Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 758, 135 S.Ct. 2699, 192 L.Ed.2d 674 (2015). By contrast, as noted above, the Secretary here chose the second option from Regents, and `dealt with the problem afresh' by taking new agency action. 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1908. That second option can be more procedurally onerous than the first—the agency must comply with the procedural requirements for new agency action—but the benefit is that the agency is not limited to its prior reasons in justifying its decision. Ibid. Indeed, the entire purpose of the October 29 Memoranda was for the Secretary to issue a new rescission bolstered by new reasons absent from the June 1 Memorandum, ibid.—reasons that he hoped would answer the District Court's concerns from the first go-round. Having returned to the drawing table and taken new action, therefore, the Secretary was not subject to the charge of post hoc rationalization.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,85,"Third, respondents invoke our decision in Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___, 139 S.Ct. 2551, 204 L.Ed.2d 978 (2019), to contend that DHS's failure to hew to the administrative straight and narrow deprives the October 29 Memoranda of the presumption of regularity that normally attends agency action, Brief for Respondents 43. As we explained in that case, in reviewing agency action, a court is ordinarily limited to evaluating the agency's contemporaneous explanation in light of the existing administrative record. Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2573. Department of Commerce involved a narrow exception to that general rule that applies where the challengers to the agency's action make a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior on the part of the agency. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2574 (quoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)). We held that exception satisfied by an accumulation of unusual circumstances that demonstrated an explanation for agency action that was incongruent with what the record revealed about the agency's priorities and decisionmaking process. Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2575.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,86,"The circumstances in this case do not come close to those in Department of Commerce. Nothing in this record suggests a significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided. Id., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2575.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,87,"Respondents direct us instead to the Government's litigation conduct. But the examples of misconduct to which respondents refer—such as a failure to timely complete the administrative record, Brief for Respondents 42—have no bearing on the legal status of the October 29 Memoranda. And in any event, they fall well short of the strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior, Overton Park, 401 U.S., at 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, that we require before deviating from our normal rule that the grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,88,"The Court of Appeals leveled the related but more modest charge that the Secretary failed to proceed with a sufficiently open mind. See, e.g., 20 F.4th, at 955 (agency proceeded without a hint of an intention to put the Termination Decision back on the chopping block and rethink things). But the agency's ex ante preference for terminating MPP—like any other feature of an administration's policy agenda —should not be held against the October 29 Memoranda. It is hardly improper for an agency head to come into office with policy preferences and ideas  and work with staff attorneys to substantiate the legal basis for a preferred policy. Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at ___, 139 S.Ct., at 2574, see also State Farm, 463 U.S., at 59, 103 S.Ct. 2856 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (As long as an agency remains within the bounds established by Congress, it is entitled to assess administrative records and evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration. (footnote omitted)).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,89,"And the critique is particularly weak on these facts. The Court of Appeals took the agency to task for its September 29 announcement of its intention to issue in the coming weeks a new memorandum terminating MPP. 20 F.4th, at 954, see ibid. (Rather than announcing an intention to reconsider its Termination Decision, the announcement set forth DHS's conclusion in unmistakable terms.). But that announcement came over six weeks after the District Court's August 13 remand—a substantial window of time for the agency to conduct a bona fide reconsideration.",Roberts,0,
2021-069,90,"More importantly, this Court has previously rejected criticisms of agency closemindedness based on an identity between proposed and final agency action. See Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U. S. ___, ___, 140 S.Ct. 2367, 2385, 207 L.Ed.2d 819 (2020) (declining to evaluate the agency's final rules under an open-mindedness test where interim and final rules were virtually identical but procedural requirements were otherwise satisfied). Similar principles refute the Court of Appeals' criticism of the October 29 Memoranda for their failure to alter the Termination Decision in any way. 20 F.4th, at 946. It is black-letter law that an agency that takes superseding action on remand is entitled to reexamine the problem, recast its rationale and reach the same result. Chenery II, 332 U.S., at 196, 67 S.Ct. 1760, see also Regents, 591 U. S., at ___, 140 S.Ct., at 1934 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (Courts often consider an agency's  additional explanations made  on remand from a court, even if the agency's bottom-line decision itself does not change.).",Roberts,0,
2021-069,91,"Finally, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent it viewed the Government's decision to appeal the District Court's injunction as relevant to the question of the October 29 Memoranda's status  as final agency action. Nothing prevents an agency from undertaking new agency action while simultaneously appealing an adverse judgment against its original action. That is particularly so under the circumstances of this case. The second condition of the District Court's injunction, which purported to bind DHS to implement MPP in perpetuity subject only to congressional funding choices outside its control, as a practical matter left the Government no choice but to appeal. And the agency reasonably chose to accede to the District Court's APA analysis of the June 1 Memorandum and seek to ameliorate those concerns in the meantime.* * *",Roberts,0,
2021-069,92,"For the reasons explained, the Government's rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda did constitute final agency action. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the District Court should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda comply with section 706 of the APA. See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 46-57, 103 S.Ct. 2856.",Roberts,0,

As the recent history illustrates, every President since the late 1990s has employed the parole option, and President Trump also employed the return-to-Mexico option for a relatively small group of non-citizens. Because the immigration statutes afford substantial discretion to the Executive, different Presidents may exercise that discretion differently. That is Administrative Law 101. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

By law, if an alien is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien  shall be detained for a removal proceeding. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). And if an alien asserts a credible fear of persecution, he or she shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum, § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Those requirements, as we have held, are mandatory. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018).",Alito,0,

This practice violates the clear terms of the law, but the Court looks the other way.",Alito,0,

Because existing detention facilities could not house all the people who were attempting to enter unlawfully, many illegal aliens with meritless asylum claims were being released into the United States, and many, once released, simply `disappeared.'

2021-069,124,"That footnote's reference to the Government's brief in Gonzalez raised an obvious question. Section 1252(f)(1) refers to orders that enjoin or restrain the operation of specified statutory provisions, and in Gonzalez, the Government suggested that this provision should not be interpreted to apply only to injunctions.

Instead, the Government refused to rule out the possibility that the provision might also apply to class-wide declaratory relief, and it analogized § 1252(f)(1) to the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, and cited our decision in California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982), which interpreted that provision in a `practical sense.' Id., at 408, 102 S.Ct. 2498.",Alito,0,
2021-069,125,"In the present case, the Government challenged the order of the District Court setting aside under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), the June termination of MPP, and since this order had a practical effect that was in some respects similar to an injunction, the Government's argument in Gonzalez raised the question whether the Government thought that § 1252(f)(1) also barred the District Court from reviewing the termination of the MPP under the APA. That is an important question the resolution of which could have effects extending far beyond this particular dispute, and at oral argument the Solicitor General took the far-reaching position that § 1252(f)(1) does indeed bar APA review. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14. But none of the papers filed by the Government in this case or in Gonzalez said one word about APA review. Nor did the respondents' brief.

The  Court could have—and, in my judgment, should have—dealt with this problem by deciding this case without saying anything about § 1252(f)(1) other than that it bars injunctive relief. Instead, with the end of the Term looming ahead, the Court directed the parties to brief these issues, but it gave them just one week to do so. And as the Court should have anticipated, those briefs raised new questions that it would have been useful to explore at argument had that been held.

We would have been in a position to give thorough consideration to the § 1252(f)(1) issue if it had been addressed in the parties' regular briefs, but having relegated the issue to a terse footnote in its brief, and having been unprepared to discuss the issue at argument, the Government is not entitled to any further special treatment.

First, the majority errs in holding that the INA does not really mean what it says when it commands that the aliens in question shall be detained pending removal or asylum proceedings unless they are either returned to Mexico or paroled on a case-by-case basis. According to the majority, it is fine for DHS simply to release these aliens en masse and allow them to disappear. Second, the majority improperly faults the Court of Appeals for refusing to allow the Government to derail the appellate process by a last-minute maneuver designed to thwart review of the manner in which it initially terminated MPP.",Alito,0,
2021-069,131,"As described above, the INA gives DHS three options regarding the treatment of the aliens in question while they await removal or asylum proceedings. They may be (1) detained in this country or (2) returned to Mexico or (3) paroled on a case-by-case basis. Congress has provided no fourth option, but the majority now creates one. According to the majority, an alien who cannot be detained due to a shortage of detention facilities but could be returned to Mexico may simply be released. That is wrong.",Alito,0,
2021-069,133,"The language of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A) is unequivocal. With narrow exceptions that are inapplicable here,4 it provides that every alien who is an applicant for admission and who the examining immigration officer determines is not clearly and beyond a  doubt entitled to be admitted  shall be detained for a removal proceeding. (Emphasis added.) Six years ago, the Government argued strenuously that this requirement is mandatory, and its brief could hardly have been more categorical or emphatic in making this point. See Brief for Petitioners in Jennings v. Rodriguez, O. T. 2017, No. 151204, p. 15 (Aliens seeking admission who are not `clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted' are statutorily prohibited from physically entering the United States and must be detained during removal proceedings , unless the Secretary exercises his discretion to release them on parole), id., at 17 (Unlike the word `may,' which implies discretion, the word `shall' usually connotes a requirement. And here, the repeated `shall be detained' clearly means what it says (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).",Alito,0,
2021-069,134,"The Jennings Court correctly accepted that argument, which was central to our holding. See 583 U. S., at ___, 138 S.Ct., 842 (Read most naturally, §§ 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2) thus mandate detention of applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded). But now, in an about-face, the Government argues that shall be detained actually means may be detained. See Brief for Petitioners 29 (The Court will not construe a provision stating that law enforcement `shall' take some action as a `true mandate' absent `some stronger indication from the  Legislature').",Alito,0,
2021-069,135,"The Government was correct in Jennings and is wrong here. Shall be detained means shall be detained. The Government points out that it lacks the facilities to detain all the aliens in question, and no one questions that fact. But use of the contiguous-return authority would at least reduce the number of aliens who are released in violation of the INA's command. The District Court made a factual finding that rescinding MPP would cause additional violations of Congress's unambiguous detention mandate. 554 F.Supp.3d, at 851-852. It also found that the termination of MPP has contributed to the current border surge by giving aliens the perverse incentive, id., at 837, App. 196, to cross the border illegally in hopes of being paroled and released. Id., at 79. Thus, the Government is failing to meet the statutory detention mandate, not only because of limitations on its detention capacity but also because it refuses to use the contiguous-territory return authority.",Alito,0,
2021-069,136,"Other than the argument that shall means may, the Government's only other textual argument is that it is paroling aliens on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, as permitted under § 1182(d)(5)(A). But the number of aliens paroled each month under that provision— more than 27,000 in April of this year5— gives rise to a strong inference that the Government is not really making these decisions on a case-by-case basis. The Government argues that respondents had the burden to show that it is not making case-by-case determinations and that they have not met that burden, see Brief for Petitioners 34, but information about the true  nature of these proceedings is in the Government's possession, and it has revealed little about what actually takes place. At argument, however, the Solicitor General argued that the case-by-case determination requirement can be met simply by going through a brief checklist for each alien. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58-60. Even the rudimentary step of verifying that an alien does not have a criminal record is not performed in every case. Id., at 31. Such procedures are inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of case-by-case review, and as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the circumstances under which § 1182(d)(5)(B)) was adopted bolster that conclusion. See 20 F.4th, at 947 (After the executive branch on multiple occasions purported to use the parole power to bring in large groups of immigrants, Congress twice amended 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) to limit the scope of the parole power and prevent the executive branch from using it as a programmatic policy tool (citing T. Aleinikoff et al., Immigration and Citizenship: Process and Policy 300 (9th ed. 2021))).",Alito,0,

Brief for Petitioners 6, 33-36.

2021-069,140,"The majority's chief defense of the Government's rejection of MPP is based on a blinkered method of statutory interpretation that we have firmly rejected. The majority largely ignores the mandatory detention requirement imposed by § 1225(b)(2)(A) and, instead, reads the contiguous-return provision, § 1225(b)(2)(C), in isolation. That provision says that the Secretary may return aliens to the country from which they entered, not that the Secretary must do so, and for the majority, that is enough to show that use of that authority is not required.",Alito,0,

And if we follow that canon, the majority's interpretation collapses.",Alito,0,
2021-069,142,"Read as a whole, the INA gives DHS discretion to choose from among only three options for handling the relevant category of inadmissible aliens. The Government must either: (1) detain them, (2) return them to a contiguous foreign nation, or (3) parole them into the United States on an individualized, case-by-case basis. These options operate in a hydraulic relationship: When it is not possible for the  Government to comply with the statutory mandate to detain inadmissible aliens pending further proceedings, it must resort to one or both of the other two options in order to comply with the detention requirement to the greatest extent possible.",Alito,0,
2021-069,143,"There is nothing strange about this interpretation of how the relevant provisions of the INA work together. Consider this example. Suppose a state law provides that every school district shall provide a free public education to every student from kindergarten through the 12th grade and that another statute says that a district may arrange for its students to attend high school in an adjacent district. A small district refuses to operate its own high school because it lacks the necessary funds, and this district also declines to arrange for its students to attend a school in an adjacent district because the law says only that a district may take that course of action. Refusing to exercise this discretionary authority, the district throws up its hands and says to its high school students: We're sorry. If you want to go to high school, you will have to make your own arrangements and foot the bill. If those students sue, would any court sustain what the district did?",Alito,0,
2021-069,144,"Other examples come readily to mind. Suppose that a building code says that every multi-unit residential building shall have at least two means of egress from upper floors, and suppose that another provision says that such a building may have an external fire escape. The owner of such a building refuses to construct a second internal stairway because the cost would be prohibitive and also declines to install a fire escape because the law says that option is discretionary. Would the owner's non-compliance be permitted?",Alito,0,
2021-069,145,Here is one more example. A State that operates its own motor vehicle inspection facilities has a law that says that every vehicle shall be inspected every year. The law also says that motorists may have their vehicles inspected at a licensed private garage. A motorist fails to have his car inspected because he must work during the time when the state facility is open and would be fired if he took time off. This motorist also declines to have his car inspected at a private garage that is open during his off hours because the law says only that he may use such a facility. Would the motorist escape a citation?,Alito,0,
2021-069,146,"The answer in each of the above examples is that the failure to make use of the discretionary option would not be seen as a valid excuse for non-compliance with the command that certain conduct shall be performed, and it is also hard to see the difference between those examples and the situation here.",Alito,0,
2021-069,148,"The majority's main reason for rejecting the argument just described is that the contiguous-return provision does not say expressly that it was meant to operate as a mandatory cure of any non-compliance with the Government's detention obligations. Ante, at 2541. But what logic compels need not be stated expressly.",Alito,0,
2021-069,149,"The majority also relies on the fact that the contiguous-return provision was enacted 90 years after the provision requiring detention and the fact that the circumstances under which the contiguous-return provision was adopted suggest that it was intended to serve only a humble role. Ante, at 2542-2543. Those circumstances cannot change what the relevant provisions say or the way in which they logically work together. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 568, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005) (Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent that  they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature's understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms).

Ante, at 2542-2543 (majority opinion), ante, at 2549 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). But enforcement of immigration laws often has foreign relations implications, and the Constitution gives Congress broad authority to set immigration policy. See Art. I, § 8, cl. 4. This means, we have said, that policies pertaining to the entry of aliens are entrusted exclusively to Congress. Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954) (emphasis added). The President has vital power in the field of foreign affairs, so does Congress, and the President does not have the authority to override immigration laws enacted by Congress. Indeed, when the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).

2021-069,153,"Not only does the majority fail to heed the clear language of the INA, but it gratuitously faults the Court of Appeals for what appears to be a fairly modest and correct conclusion: that the October 29 Memoranda purporting to re-terminate MPP did not ultimately affect the merits of the appeal of the judgment that was before that court. The Government issued its October 29 Memoranda after briefing in the Court of Appeals had been completed and only days before the appeal was set to be argued. Based on those memoranda, the Government asked the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment below, but it did not provide a full administrative record or give the District Court an opportunity to review the purported new decision in the first instance by filing a Rule 60(b) motion.6 The majority now says that the Court of Appeals erred by failing to treat the October 29 Memoranda as a new, final agency action, but the majority does not say what applying that label would have required the Fifth Circuit to do differently.",Alito,0,
2021-069,154,"As I see it, the Government's litigation tactic—filing the October 29 Memoranda with a suggestion of mootness but without seeking to dismiss its appeal—could have triggered one of four responses from the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals could have (1) dismissed the appeal as moot and vacated the District Court's judgment and injunction, (2) held the appeal in abeyance for an unspecified time, (3) evaluated the October 29 Memoranda  as final agency action in the first instance under the APA, or (4) concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect the appeal, which challenged the June termination. The Court of Appeals picked the fourth option, and taking each option in turn, I will explain why that was the response best suited to avoid derailing the ordinary appellate process.",Alito,0,
2021-069,155,"First, the October 29 Memoranda did not moot the appeal. A case becomes moot only if it is impossible for the court to `grant any effectual relief.' Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172, 133 S.Ct. 1017, 185 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013). Under this high standard, the Fifth Circuit was correct that the case was not moot. Although the Government claimed that the appeal was moot, it asked the Court of Appeals for relief, namely, vacatur of District Court's injunction. It was compelled to take that position because the October 29 Memoranda, by their own terms, did not take effect as long as that injunction remained in force. See 20 F.4th, at 957. And without an appellate decision holding that the INA allows the Government to release aliens who could be returned to Mexico, the issuance of a new administrative order terminating MPP could not provide a ground for vacating the injunction. It is telling that the Government's briefing in this Court never suggests that the case was moot at the time of the Fifth Circuit's decision or that the case is now moot.",Alito,0,
2021-069,156,"Second, the Court of Appeals did not err by declining to hold the appeal in abeyance. The Government originally asked the Court of Appeals to hold the appeal while it completed the process of issuing a new termination decision, but by the time of oral argument in that court, the Government claimed that such a decision had been issued. And the Government did not file a motion in the District Court to vacate its judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The Government had sought to expedite proceedings at every stage, including by seeking emergency relief in the Fifth Circuit and this Court, and under these circumstances, it was eminently reasonable for the Court of Appeals to conclude that additional delay would not have served the interests of economy of time and effort. Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936).",Alito,0,
2021-069,157,"Third, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda could not satisfy our criteria for a final agency action that could be reviewed in the first instance in the Court of Appeals under the APA. Like this Court, the courts of appeal are courts of `review, and not first view.' City of Austin v. Reagan Nat. Advertising of Austin, LLC, 596 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 142 S.Ct. 1464, 1476, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022) (quoting Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 201, 132 S.Ct. 1421, 182 L.Ed.2d 423 (2012)). With no administrative record for the October 29 Memoranda before it, the Court of Appeals was in a poor position to assess whether the memoranda actually marked the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process, Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the October 29 Memoranda did not purport to result in a final determination of `rights or obligations.' Ibid. As DHS acknowledged, the termination of MPP could not be implemented until there was a final judicial decision to vacate the injunction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 264a, 270a. And until that was accomplished, the memoranda did not impose on DHS officers or employees any `obligation' to cease implementation of MPP. Bennett, 520 U.S., at 178, 117 S.Ct. 1154. On this basis, the Fifth Circuit rightly understood that the October 29 Memoranda could have no legal effect while DHS  was bound by an injunction to implement MPP in good faith and that this injunction would remain in force unless the Government's challenge to the June termination was decided in its favor.7",Alito,0,
2021-069,158,"Even if the Fifth Circuit had somehow concluded that the October 29 Memoranda constituted final agency action with some future legal consequences, the Court does not explain what the Fifth Circuit should have done differently in the circumstances it faced. The Fifth Circuit had little ability to review whether the agency had acted reasonably. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). And the Fifth Circuit provided a reasonable explanation for its actions.",Alito,0,
2021-069,159,"With these three options off the table, the Fifth Circuit reasonably chose the fourth option. It correctly concluded that the October 29 Memoranda did not affect its ability to review the District Court judgment. To find fault with proceeding in that fashion, the majority seems to assume that an administrative agency may obviate a district court decision setting aside agency action under § 706 of the APA by pursing the following course of conduct: first, appeal the district court decision, second, take a purportedly new action that achieves the same result as the one previously set aside, and third, while declining to seek vacatur of the earlier judgment in the district court, ask the court of appeals to vacate that judgment without reviewing its correctness or the lawfulness of the second action. The Court of Appeals was correct to view this as an effort to thwart the normal appellate process.* * *",Alito,0,
2021-069,160,"While I would affirm the Fifth Circuit if we reached the merits, I agree with the majority that the District Court on remand should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda complied with § 706 of the APA. The District Court should assess, among other things, whether it is arbitrary and capricious for DHS to refuse to use its contiguous-territory return authority to avoid violations of the statute's clear detention mandate, whether the deterrent effect that DHS found MPP produced in reducing dangerous attempted illegal border crossings, as well as MPP's reduction of unmeritorious asylum claims, is adequately accounted for in the agency's new decision, and whether DHS's rescission of MPP is causing it to make parole decisions on an unlawful categorical basis rather than case-by-case, as the statute prescribes.",Alito,0,

2021-069,162,"I agree with the Court's analysis of the merits—but not with its decision to reach them. The lower courts in this case concluded that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act sharply limiting federal courts' jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of certain immigration laws, did not present a jurisdictional bar. Just two weeks ago, however, we repudiated their reasoning in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U. S. ___, 142 S.Ct. 2057, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2022). Because we are a court of review and not first view, I would vacate and remand for the lower courts to reconsider their assertion of jurisdiction in light of Aleman Gonzalez.* * *",Barrett,0,
2021-069,163,"Section 1252(f)(1) provides that no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of specified immigration provisions, except as applied to an individual alien against whom proceedings under those provisions have been initiated. Some lower courts have narrowly interpreted this provision, holding that it does not bar relief that a plaintiff frames as requiring (rather than preventing) the Government's enforcement of or compliance with the covered immigration laws. E.g., 20 F.4th 928, 1004 (CA5 2021). In this case, that was the only ground pressed by respondents below and relied on by the lower courts to hold that § 1252(f)(1) did not bar jurisdiction. Ibid., see App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a, Brief for Appellees in No. 21-10806 (CA5), pp. 40-41. But we just rejected this interpretation in Aleman Gonzalez. There, we held that § 1252(f)(1) deprives lower courts of jurisdiction to entertain requests for injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions (subject to an exception, indisputably inapplicable to this case, for a suit by an individual noncitizen in proceedings under those provisions). 596 U. S., at ___, ___, 142 S.Ct., at 2062-2063, 2064-2065.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,164,"In the normal course, we would vacate and remand this case for further proceedings in light of Aleman Gonzalez. Instead, the Court plows ahead to break new jurisdictional ground. Acting on a compressed timeline, it embraces a theory of § 1252(f)(1) that—so far as I can tell—no court of appeals has ever adopted: that § 1252(f)(1) limits only the lower courts' remedial authority, not their subject-matter jurisdiction. The only court of appeals to have addressed this theory rejected it. Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 354-356 (CA4 2022). Still, the Court is confident enough to proceed based on short, barely adversarial supplemental briefs. (The United States' original brief devoted only a conclusory footnote to the jurisdictional question, and Texas and Missouri did not respond.) And these supplemental briefs are particularly unhelpful because, having been submitted prior to our decision in Aleman Gonzalez, they could not address that decision's significance for this case. In fact, they devoted a considerable portion of their allotted length to the issue that Aleman Gonzalez subsequently resolved.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,165,"This would all matter less if the jurisdictional question were easy or unimportant —but it is neither. The Court's opinion papers over difficult issues, as I will discuss below, and its jurisdictional holding is likely to affect many cases. See, e.g., Texas v. Biden, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2022 WL 658579, *14 (ND Tex., Mar. 4, 2022) (§ 1252(f)(1) does not bar Texas' claim that the Federal Government is wrongly refusing  to detain noncitizens to determine if they have COVID-19), Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order 8-9 in Arizona v. CDC, Civ. No. 6:22-cv-00885 (WD La., Apr. 22, 2022) (arguing that § 1252(f)(1) prohibits a district court from constraining the Federal Government's removal discretion in litigation challenging termination of Title 42 order). We should not short circuit the ordinary process.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,166,"I have several doubts about the Court's analysis of § 1252(f)(1). To begin with, the Court assumes that we face an either/or choice between subject-matter jurisdiction and remedial authority, with the former being only about a court's authority to decide merits questions and the latter being only about the relief a court can grant. Ante, at 2554. This dichotomy makes the Court's job easier, because it can use the obvious point that § 1252(f)(1) strips lower courts of remedial authority to establish that § 1252(f)(1) does not strip them of subject-matter jurisdiction. But why is it a binary choice? I would think that Congress is free to link a court's subject-matter jurisdiction to its remedial authority. That is not so different from an amount-in-controversy requirement, which conditions a district court's ability to address the merits on the relief that the plaintiff seeks. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over diversity cases only when the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000). And the redressability requirement of Article III itself establishes a tie between jurisdiction and remedies, because a court's inability to order effective relief deprives it of jurisdiction to decide the merits of a question otherwise within its competence. See, e.g., California v. Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___, 141 S.Ct. 2104, 2115, 210 L.Ed.2d 230 (2021) (redressability considers the relationship between `the judicial relief requested' and the `injury' suffered), Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105-107, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (failure to allege sufficient likelihood of future injury deprives a federal court of Article III jurisdiction to entertain the count of the complaint seeking injunctive relief).",Barrett,0,
2021-069,167,"So it seems to me quite possible that § 1252(f)(1) withdraws subject-matter jurisdiction over cases seeking certain remedies. Indeed, while the Government has a theory for why the Court can reach the merits in this case, it characterizes § 1252(f)(1) as imposing jurisdictional limitations that speak to `a court's power' and `can never be forfeited or waived.' Supplemental Brief for Petitioners 19-20, see also Miranda, 34 F.4th, at 354 (concluding that § 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdiction-stripping statute that cannot be waived). If there is a reason to treat limitations on subject-matter jurisdiction and limitations on remedial authority as mutually exclusive—either in general or in this statutory scheme—the Court does not explain it.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,168,"The Court breezes past other questions too. Most notably, it gives surprisingly little attention to a phrase on which it places significant weight: § 1252(f)(1)'s parenthetical exempting the Supreme Court from its general bar on jurisdiction or authority. The parties hardly discuss this parenthetical, which does not appear to have an analogue elsewhere in the United States Code. The Court, however, takes the phrase as conclusive evidence that § 1252(f)(1) does not deprive district courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over non-individual claims under the covered provisions, because if it did, no such claims could ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provision's specific carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory. Ante, at 2532.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,169,"While this interpretation has some surface appeal, the Court does not explain how it would work. Does it mean that the restriction on remedial authority is subject to waiver or forfeiture, so that a lower court can sometimes properly enter non-individual injunctive relief that this Court can then review? That a district court has the authority to enter some kinds of non-individual relief (for example, a classwide declaratory judgment) and that this Court can enter different relief (for example, a classwide injunction) on review of that judgment? Or that this Court can enter an injunction on appeal if the district court could have entered at least one form of relief, even if it actually entered only relief that exceeded its authority?* Or perhaps the parenthetical serves the very different purpose of clarifying that § 1252(f)(1) does not disturb any pre-existing authority this Court has under the All Writs Act or other sources. These are difficult questions, yet the Court does not address any of them.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,170,"Indeed, the Court explicitly chooses not to opine on some of the issues that might help explain the parenthetical's unusual reservation. See ante, at 2540, n. 4. For example, the Court declines to decide whether the bar in § 1252(f)(1) is subject to forfeiture, even though that is a defining feature of nonjurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 138 S.Ct. 13, 199 L.Ed.2d 249 (2017). It reserves the question whether § 1252(f)(1) bars declaratory relief, an issue on which there are conflicting views. Compare Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (CA3 2011) (it does not bar declaratory relief), with id., at 1019-1021 (Fuentes, J., dissenting) (it does), with Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 880, n. 8 (CA6 2018) (it depends). And it avoids a position on whether § 1252(f)(1) prevents a lower court from vacating or setting aside an agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Not that I fault the Court for holding back. Quite the contrary: The questions surrounding § 1252(f)(1) are complex and deserve more attention than we can give them in this posture.",Barrett,0,
2021-069,171,"As a final touch, the Court asserts that our precedent has already charted this course. Ante, at 2539-2541. But the Court cannot muster much on that front. It cites a passing statement rejecting an inapposite argument that § 1252(f)(1) is a jurisdictional grant, see Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 481, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999), a brief discussion from a plurality opinion in a case where the § 1252(f)(1) issue had not been briefed or argued by the parties in this Court, see Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___, ___ - ___, 139 S.Ct. 954, 962-963, 203 L.Ed.2d 333 (2019), and a dissent, see Jennings v. Rodriguez,  583 U. S ___, ___, 138 S.Ct. 830, 875-876, 200 L.Ed.2d 122 (2018) (opinion of BREYER, J.). None provides a clear roadmap for this case.* * *",Barrett,0,
2021-069,172,"Given all this, I would tread more carefully. We should let the lower courts be the first to address the substantial antecedent questions that § 1252(f)(1) presents in light of our hot-off-the-presses decision in Aleman Gonzalez. I respectfully dissent.",Barrett,0,
