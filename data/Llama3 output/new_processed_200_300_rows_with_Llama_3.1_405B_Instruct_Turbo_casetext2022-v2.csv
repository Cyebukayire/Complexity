2022-001,248,"8 The historical context demonstrates that it was the Corps' failure to regulate to the full extent of Congress' navigation power, not its commerce power generally, that led to the enactment of the CWA. See Albrecht & Nickelsburg, 11047 (explaining that the CWA's legislative history is better interpreted as the Supreme Court in SWANCC read it, to mean simply that Congress intended to override previous, unduly narrow agency interpretations to assert its broadest constitutional authority over the traditional navigable waters), see also S.

2022-001,249,"9 Section 404(g), added by the 1977 CWA Amendments, does not demonstrate that the CWA departs from traditional conceptions of navigability. That provision states that States may administer permit programs for discharges into navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce , including wetlands adjacent thereto). 91 Stat. 1601 (codified, as amended, at 33 U.S.C. § 1344(g)). This provision thus authorizes States to establish their own permit programs over a discrete class of traditionally navigable waters of the United States: those that once were navigable waters of the United States, but are no longer navigable in fact. See Economy Light & Power Co., 256 U.S., at 123-124, 41 S.Ct. 409. Some have asserted that this nonjurisdictional provision—the function of which in the statute is to expand state authority —signals that Congress actually intended an unprecedented expansion of federal authority over the States.

2022-001,250,"10 Further scholarship notes that the term commerce as originally understood was bound tightly with the Lex Mercatoria and the sort of activities engaged in by merchants: buying and selling products made by others (and sometimes land), associated finance and financial instruments, navigation and other carriage, and intercourse across jurisdictional lines.

Its argument is that, because the Disputed Instruments are, when compared to money orders, generally larger-value instruments that are typically purchased by consumers who can more easily absorb any additional recordkeeping-related costs, those products simply do not implicate the FDA's core (cost-related) concerns and are thus not similar to money orders.",Jackson,0,,5,"Undaunted, Delaware attempts to make the differences it identifies seem more material by proffering an alternative vision of the FDA.

And [statute]'s text suggests at least a partial answer: when the books and records of banking and financial organizations and business associations engaged in issuing and selling the instruments at issue do not, as a matter of business practice, show the last known addresses of purchasers of such instruments, such that, absent application of [statute], the products would not be distributed as a matter of equity among the several States. [statute]. This answer follows not only from [statute]'s codified findings, but also from [statute], insofar as the text applies both to instruments that can be defined as money orders (in light of their inherent features) and also to instruments that are similar to money orders for escheatment purposes."

But, given this unusual statute, that is not an anomalous outcome. Both Congress (in the text of the FDA) and this Court (in our precedents) have indicated a preference for the equitable distribution of escheats, and our common-law rules can result in equitable escheatment if the business practices of the company possessing the funds suffice. The FDA is a recognition that, sometimes, our common-law rules do not achieve that out-come, i.e., it is the equivalent of a statutory Band-Aid if our common-law rules fail. In other words, the FDA is a statutory fix that need only kick in when, as a matter of business practice, the company holding the funds does not generally collect the relevant address information, such that inequitable escheatment occurs. The text and context of the FDA—and especially the phrase other similar written instrument—connote that flexibility and do not suggest that the statute only and exclusively applies to a static category of products.",Jackson,0,,7,"It is true that, so interpreted, the status of a particular category of instrument as falling within or outside of the FDA's scope could shift if the company in possession of the funds changes its regular or ordinary business practices.

Before us, Delaware does not dispute the Special Master's conclusion that MoneyGram is directly liable on the Disputed Instruments. When referencing a bank's liability on a MoneyGram product, it appears that the Special Master was using the term to describe a situation where a bank—as opposed to only MoneyGram—also has an obligation to pay the prepaid instrument upon proper presentment.",Jackson,0,,5,"When they appeared before the Special Master, the parties and experts disagreed on the meaning of liability, and no one has proffered an agreed-upon definition to this Court.
