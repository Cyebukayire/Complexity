2022-001,36,"This case concerns a nagging question about the outer reaches of the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal law regulating water pollution in the United States.[1] By all accounts, the Act has been a great success. Before its enactment in 1972, many of the Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams were severely polluted, and existing federal legislation had proved to be inadequate. Today, many formerly fetid bodies of water are safe for the use and enjoyment of the people of this country.",Alito,0,,4,"<cleaned_text> This case concerns a nagging question about the outer reaches of the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal law regulating water pollution in the United States[citation] By all accounts, the Act has been a great success Before its enactment in 1972, many of the Nations rivers, lakes, and streams were severely polluted, and existing federal legislation had proved to be inadequate Today, many formerly fetid bodies of water are safe for the use and enjoyment of the people of this country [end]"
2022-001,37,"There is, however, an unfortunate footnote to this success story: the outer boundaries of the Act's geographical reach have been uncertain from the start. The Act applies to ""the waters of the United States,"" but what does that phrase mean? Does the term encompass any backyard that is soggy enough for some minimum period of time? Does it reach ""mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, [or] playa lakes?""[2] How about ditches, swimming pools, and puddles?",Alito,0,,7,"<cleaned_text> There is, however, an unfortunate footnote to this success story: the outer boundaries of the Act's geographical reach have been uncertain from the start.

2022-001,38,"For more than a half century, the agencies responsible for enforcing the Act have wrestled with the problem and adopted varying interpretations. On three prior occasions, this Court has tried to clarify the meaning of ""the waters of the United States."" But the problem persists.

2022-001,40,"For most of this Nation's history, the regulation of water pollution was left almost entirely to the States and their subdivisions. The common law permitted aggrieved parties to bring nuisance suits against polluters. But as industrial production and population growth increased the quantity and toxicity of pollution, States gradually shifted to enforcement by regulatory agencies.[4] Conversely, federal regulation was largely limited to ensuring that ""traditional navigable waters""—that is, interstate waters that were either navigable in fact and used in commerce or readily susceptible of being used in this way— remained free of impediments. See, e.g., Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 30 Stat. 1151, see also United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S. 377, 406-407, 61 S.Ct. 291, 85 L.Ed. 243 (1940), The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563, 19 L.Ed. 999 (1871).",Alito,0,,4,"<cleaned_text> For most of this Nation's history, the regulation of water pollution was left almost entirely to the States and their subdivisions.

2022-001,41,"Congress's early efforts at directly regulating water pollution were tepid. Although the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 allowed federal officials to seek judicial abatement of pollution in interstate waters, it imposed high hurdles, such as requiring the consent of the State where the pollution originated. See 62 Stat. 1156-1157. Despite repeated amendments over the next two decades, few actions were brought under this framework.[5]",Alito,0,,3,"<cleaned_text> Congress's early attempts at directly regulating water pollution were mild. Even though the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 permitted federal officials to request judicial eradication of pollution in interstate waters, it laid down challenging barriers, like needing the agreement of the State where the pollution started. See [statute]. Despite recurrent amendments over the following two decades, only a handful of actions were initiated under this structure.[citation] [end]"
2022-001,42,"Congress eventually replaced this scheme in 1972 with the CWA. See 86 Stat. 816. The Act prohibits ""the discharge of any pollutant"" into ""navigable waters."" 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1362(12)(A). It broadly defines the term ""`pollutant'"" to include not only contaminants like ""chemical wastes,"" but also more mundane materials like ""rock, sand,"" and ""cellar dirt."" § 1362(6).",Alito,0,,3,"<cleaned_text> Congress eventually replaced this scheme in 1972 with the CWA [citation].

2022-001,43,"The CWA is a potent weapon. It imposes what have been described as ""crushing"" consequences ""even for inadvertent violations."" Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 602, 136 S.Ct. 1807, 195 L.Ed.2d 77 (2016) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Property owners who negligently discharge ""pollutants"" into covered waters may face severe criminal penalties including imprisonment. § 1319(c). These penalties increase for knowing violations. Ibid. On the civil side, the CWA imposes over $60,000 in fines per day for each violation. See Note following 28 U.S.C. § 2461, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(d), 88 Fed. Reg. 989 (2023) (to be codified in 40 C.F.R. § 19.4). And due to the Act's 5-year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. § 2462, and expansive interpretations of the term ""violation,"" these civil penalties can be nearly as crushing as their criminal counterparts, see, e.g., Borden Ranch Partnership v.

2022-001,44,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly enforce the CWA.
