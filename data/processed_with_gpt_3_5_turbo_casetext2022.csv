Brief for Respondents 19. But that reading proves too much. Consider puddles, which are also defined by the ordinary presence of water even though few would describe them as ""waters."" This argument is also tough to square with SWANCC, which held that the Act does not cover isolated ponds, see 531 U.S., at 171, 121 S.Ct. 675, or Riverside Bayview, which would have had no need to focus so extensively on the adjacency of wetlands to covered waters if the EPA's reading were correct, see 474 U.S., at 131-135, and n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 455.

2022-001,85,"When this convoluted formulation is parsed, it tells us that at least some wetlands must qualify as ""waters of the United States."" The provision begins with a broad category, ""the waters of the United States,"" which we may call category A. The provision provides that States may permit discharges into these waters, but it then qualifies that States cannot permit discharges into a subcategory of A: traditional navigable waters (category B). Finally, it states that a third category (category C), consisting of wetlands ""adjacent"" to traditional navigable waters, is ""includ[ed]"" within B. Thus, States may permit discharges into A minus B, which includes C. If C (adjacent wetlands) were not part of A (""the waters of the United States"") and therefore subject to regulation under the CWA, there would be no point in excluding them from that category.
