2022-001,36,"This case concerns a nagging question about the outer reaches of the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal law regulating water pollution in the United States.[1] By all accounts, the Act has been a great success. Before its enactment in 1972, many of the Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams were severely polluted, and existing federal legislation had proved to be inadequate. Today, many formerly fetid bodies of water are safe for the use and enjoyment of the people of this country.",Alito,0,,4,"This case involves a persistent query regarding the extreme boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA), the primary federal legislation controlling water pollution in the United States[citation] Unanimously, the Act has proven to be highly effective. Prior to its implementation in 1972, a significant number of the Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams were drastically polluted, and the previously existing federal laws had shown to be inadequate. Currently, numerous previously polluted bodies of water are safe for the utilization and gratification of the inhabitants of this nation.

The Act applies to ""the waters of the United States,"" but what does that phrase mean? Does the term encompass any backyard that is soggy enough for some minimum period of time? Does it reach ""mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, [or] playa lakes?""[2] How about ditches, swimming pools, and puddles?",Alito,0,,5,"There is, however, an unfortunate footnote to this success story: the outer boundaries of the Act's geographical reach have been uncertain from the start.

The common law permitted aggrieved parties to bring nuisance suits against polluters.

2022-001,41,"Congress's early efforts at directly regulating water pollution were tepid. Although the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 allowed federal officials to seek judicial abatement of pollution in interstate waters, it imposed high hurdles, such as requiring the consent of the State where the pollution originated. See 62 Stat. 1156-1157. Despite repeated amendments over the next two decades, few actions were brought under this framework.[5]",Alito,0,,3,"Congress's early attempts to directly regulate water pollution were lukewarm. Even though the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 permitted federal officials to pursue judicial reduction of pollution in interstate waters, it set high obstacles, like necessitating the agreement of the State where the pollution started [statute].

Property owners who negligently discharge ""pollutants"" into covered waters may face severe criminal penalties including imprisonment. § 1319(c). These penalties increase for knowing violations.

The lower court of the primary case before us had ruled that the CWA encompassed wetlands adjacent to ditches and drains that eventually discharged into navigable waters at a minimum distance of 11 miles away, a notion that had backed the petitioner's conviction in an associated prosecution [citation]. Despite us overturning this decision, no stance garnered a majority agreement from the Court. Four Justices determined that the CWA's scope did not expand beyond two categories: initially, certain moderately permanent water bodies connected to conventional interstate navigable waters and, subsequently, wetlands with such an immediate physical connection to those waters that they were, for practical purposes, indistinguishable from waters of the United States [citation] (emphasis omitted). Four Justices would have conceded to the Government's decision that the wetlands in question were included under the CWA [citation](STEVENS, J, dissenting). Lastly, a single Justice decided that a CWA jurisdiction required a ""significant nexus"" between wetlands and navigable waters, and such a nexus existed where ""the wetlands, in isolation or combined with similarly situated lands in the region, considerably influence the chemical, physical and biological wholeness"" of those waters [citation] (KENNEDY, J, concurring in judgement).
